TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_64,"Is that... a Lizardman? But he's acting kind of weird."
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_65,"No one knows. The Repositorium of Golden Queen."
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_66,"Yes! When the Queen kisses me, I'll become a golden Lizardman! Ha ha ha!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_67,"Hey! You! What are you doing here?"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_68,"Ugh! Humans! Humans! Intruders!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_69,"No! Queen's gold! Weapons! Treasures! You can't take them away!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_70,"Sound the alarm! It's intruders! Code red!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_71,"What... is he saying?"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_72,"Oh! Look... There's so much weapons and armor! They look high quality, too!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_73,"A-ha! We should chase after him. Stop!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_74,"Roi! Don't leave me behind!"
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_75,"Everything is Lua's... No... Everything's our own fault."
TUTORIAL_TREASURESPOT_76,"Hey, wait for me!"
