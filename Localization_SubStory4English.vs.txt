Sub1_Rephy_1_1_1,"Guide of Blue Star"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_2,"Behind every life is a soul."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_3,"Although life comes to an end,"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_4,"the soul remains in this World of Light."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_5,"They all return to the home of souls,"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_6,"the Blue Star."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_7,"In the garden of Asiphia, Queen of Blue Star,"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_8,"they rest peacefully in the garden of rest."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_9,"They wait until they are called again by Lua"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_10,"to go back to the World of Light."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_11,"Of course, not all souls succeed."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_12,"Only pure souls who managed to cross the Starlight Bridge"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_13,"are able to go to the Blue Star."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_14,"Souls that lose their way to Starlight Bridge"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_15,"will be stained with darkness."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_16,"That is why they need spiritual guides."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_17,"So that the souls do not lose their way,"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_18,"with lamps that light up Misty Hills..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_19,"............................................."
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_20,"Are you listening?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_1_21,"Rephy... Rephy! Rephy!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_1,"Huh? I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_2,"Rephy! How could you!? How many times is this now?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_3,"I'm telling you about our most important work in the Tamian Tribe, and you're dozing off..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_4,"What? No! Rephy was listening this whole time!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_5,"We can use the God's Lamp that the Sentinel of Blue Star gave to us"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_6,"and light up some Misty Hills... on fire?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_7,"What in the world are you talking about?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_8,"Listen! We light up the Misty Hills like a beacon, with bright light!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_9,"Then, we get Starlight Bridge glowing again, and those lost souls can find their way to the Blue Star..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_10,"Zzz... Zzz..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_11,"Sleeping again...?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_12,"*Sigh...* Why did the sage pick this lackadaisical boy as his successor before he left for the Blue Star...?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_13,"What did I do wrong...? Why'd you have me take care of this boy?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_14,"Oh? *Sniff* That's... I smell something! Hey! I smell something!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_15,"How dare you!? I don't smell! I took a bath only a month ago..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_16,"No... Wait. This must be...!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_17,"It's the smell of darkness... Yeah, I can smell a really creepy scent!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_18,"They're dark souls!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_2_19,"Rephy! Stop! You can't go alone!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_3_1,"That nasty smell... All those dark souls. They're demons!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_3_2,"How dare they come to our Lamp-keeper Town!?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_3_3,"Souls of the forest! Help me!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_1,"Heh heh! Now you know what Spiritual Guide Rephy can do! How's that?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_2,"You!?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_3,"....................................."
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_4,"You're Tamian... How can you be a dark soul!?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_5,"Let's go together... souls of light... all of us..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_6,"to... the dark abyss..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_7,"No way! Can you hear me? Wake up!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_4_8,"This way! Follow this lamp! Don't get too close to the darkness!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_1,"What's happening here?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_2,"Nobody can enter Lamp-keeper Town in Elidora Forest without our permission... How did demons get here?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_3,"Was that dark soul a member of our tribe?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_4,"Yeah..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_5,"I... couldn't save him. I kept telling him to come out of the darkness..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_6,"And I lit up God's Lamp... Why didn't it work?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_7,"You told me that every soul could safely cross the Starlight Bridge when we light up the lamp!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_8,"Rephy... Calm down. That can't be done with just God's Lamp."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_9,"I told you that we need to do it at the Misty Hills to have them follow the light again."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_10,"Then... If I light up the lamp at some Misty Hills..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_11,"Everyone can return to the Blue Star, home of souls?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_12,"Of course. You... You really were listening, weren't you?."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_13,"The darkest places along the Starlight Bridge are Misty Hills."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_14,"If one gets lost there, it becomes a dark soul like that."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_15,"Phew. Thank goodness."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_16,"For a while, I started to think that story about God's Lamp was all a lie."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_17,"How dare you!? God's Lamp is the most precious treasure of Tamian Tribe!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_18,"It's how our tribe carries out our divine duty given by God Dragon Giacobini, the Sentinel of Blue Star!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_19,"We should light up the Starlight Bridge with the lamp to guide souls of light to the Blue Star."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_20,"I get it now. Wow, Mister Giaco, you really know a lot!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_21,"Ugh... I'm getting a headache. I shouldn't talk."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_22,"I'm a bit surprised, though... Even the souls of Tamians could be stained with darkness..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_23,"Misty Hills must be close now, I suppose... Darn it."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_24,"The time has come. Ahem! I, the leader of Tamian Tribe, command Spiritual Guide Rephy!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_25,"Yeah, yeah. Rephy is listening. What is it?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_26,"I command you to locate Misty Hills in this world and light them up with God's Lamp."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_27,"Leave Lamp-keeper Town right now."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_28,"Okay, I'll be taking off, then. Later!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_29,"Wait! You're not going on a trip for fun. Rephy! You've never even ventured outside of our town before!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_30,"First let me tell you how dangerous the outside world is."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_31,"You shouldn't follow anyone blindly... Stay away from stranger. Keep your money in your inner pockets..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_32,"Yeah... Yeah... Zzz..."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_33,"And you should not get close to Orvel. It is full of evil spirits."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_34,"And the only one that we can trust is the Sage Lorraine... Now! Repeat what I've just said!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_35,"Yeah? So... Sage... Sage Rephy will go... to find Misty Hills!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_36,"To Orvel... full of people that we can trust!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_37,"Alright, I'm ready to go! Goodbye. See you!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_38,"Alright. Take care. Rephy! You're the sage of the Tamian Tribe!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_39,"What? Wait! Did you just say Orvel!?"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_40,"No! You should go to see Sage Lorraine!"
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_41,"He's... gone already."
Sub1_Rephy_1_5_42,"May the Sentinel of Blue Star... the Queen... and our ancestors... watch over that child."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_1,"Wow! This is Orvel!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_2,"It's huge! There are a lot of people!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_3,"And so many souls! Uh? Souls of light... Dark souls... Grey souls..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_4,"Wow! This really is the capital city!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_5,"Hey... you. I haven't seen your kind before. Why are you here in Orvel?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_6,"Huh? I'm a Tamian. Don't you know about the Tamian Tribe?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_7,"We're spiritual guides. When you're dead, I'll guide you to the Blue Star."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_8,"What? You weird, hairy creature. Are you saying you want me to die?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_9,"You better watch what you say, especially on tumultuous days like these. You have your pass, right?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_10,"Pass? What's that? Can I eat it?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_11,"You don't know what a pass is? All you hybrid animals should have one. You're suspicious! Come, you're following me!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_12,"Okay. No, wait! Our leader told me not to follow anyone I don't know."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_13,"Then, bye!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_14,"W-wait! Stop there, you hairy creature!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_15,"There, a red cat-eared human! I've never seen a hybrid animal before! Wow! A muscular cat!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_16,"Whoa! It's so cold! There's water coming out of these round stones! Is this... water fairy magic?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_17,"Ha ha ha! Orvel is such a wonderful place! Oh? What's this?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_18,"(Whispers) There... What's that? A hybrid animal? Or a new kind of pet?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_19,"(Whispers) I don't know. But... look at that furry tail... Oh, oh!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_20,"(Whispers) Hah... Did you see the downy fur on those ears? It's so fluffy..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_21,"(Whispers) Huh! Another one is there. Is that... a Redpur wearing clothes?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_22,"So adorable!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_23,"Uh...? I get the feeling I had something important to do... Right! Rephy should be doing something!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_24,"I need to ask the sage about Misty Hills! Sage... What was the name?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_25,"H-hey, kid. Are you in any trouble? You can ask me if you need help."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_26,"I'm not a kid! I'm Rephy, sage of the Tamian Tribe!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_27,"Oh! Sorry, sage. You can ask me instead of her. I can help you out."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_28,"Who's the sage here? Where should I go to meet the sage?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_29,"Sage? Is there a sage in Orvel? I kinda remember something like that... Maybe?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_30,"Look, little sage. We'll definitely help you find where that sage is. But for now..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_31,"Let me touch your fluffy fur first!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_32,"Let go! Don't touch my fur! That feels weird!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_33,"Get your hands off my tail! Oh, you're so rude!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_34,"Go away! Huh? Who are you?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_35,"Stop it right now! Huh? Just who are you, kid?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_36,"You... You're a Tamian. What's a Tamian doing in Orvel?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_37,"Oh? You know about the Tamian Tribe. Wow! Nice to meet ya!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_38,"Yeah, but... Why are you talking to me like that? I'm an adult, not one of your kid buddies."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_39,"OMG! Look how they talk! They're even twice as adorable now!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_40,"We can't talk here. We'd better get away from all these people."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_41,"Hm... The space-time warp... isn't exactly safe, though... What should I do?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_42,"There he is! You hairy creature! Stop right there! What? And you brought your buddy? Both of you, freeze!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_43,"Hey, kid... What have you being doing?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_44,"I'm not a kid. My name is Rephy. Sage Rephy."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_45,"Alright, Rephy. We need to get out of here now!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_46,"Please... Let this space-time warp work!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_47,"What happened? Where'd they go? They disappeared..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_1_48,"Ha ha ha... I better follow them. Those two could really make me some money! Heh heh!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_1,"Whoaaa!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_2,"Oof, it hurts! Huh? Where are we?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_3,"That nasty smell... It's dark souls! A lot of them!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_4,"Ugh, my back. Um... This is... the Underground Labyrinth! What time are we in? Let me see... It looks like time hasn't changed."
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_5,"That guy told me to use this in an emergency, but it only works on space, not space-time!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_6,"(Mumbles) He used me to test his experimental stuff again. Some friend you are. I'll get you for this... Nyx."
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_7,"Hey! Red bear! Where should we go now?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_8,"I told you, don't talk to me like I'm one of your little kid buddies! And my name is Oddy. And that's redpur, not red bear... Ah, forget it."
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_9,"Hey, Oddy! Let's get out of here! There's too many dark souls in here, and it feels so creepy!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_10,"Rephy, how old are you? You know you're supposed to add 'Mister' when you talk to guys older than you, right?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_11,"I'm 14!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_12,"What? A 14-year-old Tamian is still a kid! Look, I've lived for hundreds of years..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_13,"Hm... Maybe I shouldn't be lecturing like this to a kid. At any rate, you should call me Mister. Mister Oddy!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_14,"Okay, Uncle Oddy!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_15,"What? Uncle Oddy?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_16,"I don't like saying Mister. I like Uncle! Now, let's hurry and get out of here!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_2_17,"Urgh... Do whatever you want. Uncle Oddy's going, too."
Sub1_Rephy_2_3_1,"Hey. Where should we go to get out of here?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_3_2,"Let me see. If this is the Royal Underground Labyrinth, we should go this way."
Sub1_Rephy_2_3_3,"I came here two days ago, so this should be the way. *Ahem*"
Sub1_Rephy_2_3_4,"Wow! Okay, then I'll trust you, Uncle Oddy."
Sub1_Rephy_2_4_1,"It's the Royal Underground, but why are there so many demons here?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_4_2,"You shouldn't ask things like that so carelessly, Rephy."
Sub1_Rephy_2_4_3,"Hm, but maybe it's understandable if a little kid wouldn't know that."
Sub1_Rephy_2_4_4,"Uncle Oddy! Do you really know the way out?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_4_5,"O-of course. I told you I was here. So... here, we can go this way straight. Maybe..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_4_6,"Hmm... It doesn't look that way."
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_1,"Urgh... Demons... Too many dark souls. Are we going to die?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_2,"Stop your nonsense! No one's gonna die here! I have bad sense of direction, but I know the way out... Ugh."
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_3,"..................................."
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_4,"..................................."
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_5,"Don't worry... I'll guide your soul to the Blue Star before I go."
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_6,"Stop! You shouldn't give up that fast!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_7,"Tada! Finally, your prayers have been answered! So, you guys are in life-threatening danger?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_8,"Just leave it to Requina. I'll save your lives for a reasonable price! Ha ha!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_9,"Huh? What... what price? How much will that be?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_10,"It will be... *Whispers*"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_11,"What? That's too expensive!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_12,"Nope! Well, don't worry. Instead of money, you have to do something for me."
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_13,"But you have to do it for me, no matter what it is! Deal?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_14,"Okay! Deal! You'll help us fight them now?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_15,"Don't agree to deals so quickly!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_16,"But... we have no choice. We are literally about to die. Alright. Deal!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_17,"Hu hu hu! Very well! We have a deal!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_5_18,"Then, let's get out of this labyrinth!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_1,"Come! Come on here! You've never seen a poisonous Muhroom like this, right?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_2,"It's toxic enough to bring a Manticore to the Blue Star at once!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_3,"Welcome..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_4,"What are you doing? You need to put your heart and soul into promoting this stuff. That's our deal!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_5,"If you can't make 5 times the amount of sales I normally make today, the deal extends for another 5 days! Hu hu!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_6,"Welcome! You can find every poison in the world here!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_7,"A Redpur like me would know! Come visit us!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_8,"Wow! Great, Uncle Oddy!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_9,"Rephy will do his best, too! God's Lamp, light up!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_10,"Look... Aren't those the cuties who were at the square?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_11,"Oh! You're right! I guess they're the mascots for that store!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_12,"Poison? Is there a poison for killing demons?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_13,"Oh! Of course, we have! Come on in! First come, first served for the first 50 people in line!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_14,"You can pat the mascots of our store for 1 minute!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_15,"What the heck!?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_16,"Me! I came here first! Me! Me first!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_17,"Okay, okay. Line up please!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_18,".........................................................."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_19,"Please... save me..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_20,"780... 890... 1,300... Okay! The two of you did very well today!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_21,"Today, my sales were 10 times higher than usual! Hu hu! Won't you consider working for me part-time?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_22,"Ha ha... Are we still alive?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_23,"Yeah... Uncle Oddy, your soul hasn't gone to Starlight Bridge."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_24,"Oh, never mind if you don't want to! Hey! Take it! This is your commission!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_25,"We fox people always pay back people for their help. Thanks to you, I earned a lot today."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_26,"Hm, I should close the store now. Our regular customers should be coming around at this time."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_27,"Well, maybe we'll run into each other again sometime. Oh, and let me know anytime if you want to work part-time for me! Bye!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_28,"Huh... She left so quickly, it almost feels like working for her was kind of like a dream."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_29,"Let me see. Oh! Actually, this commission is a pretty good amount of money!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_30,"........................................."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_31,"Uh? Rephy, is something wrong?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_32,"I... want to accomplish my first mission as a spiritual guide."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_33,"But I didn't find that sage yet. Our leader told me that sage was in Orvel, but all the people I met here are all weird."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_34,"A sage in Orvel? Sage, huh... Are you talking about Lorraine?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_35,"Ah! Right! Lorraine! I think that's the name!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_36,"Why are you looking for her in Orvel? You need to go to Elidora Forest, where all the Elves are. Oh, boy!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_37,"So, the sage isn't in Orvel? I need to go to Elidora, then."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_38,"Are all Tamians as dense as you?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_39,"Uh? I don't know. But our leader always tells me to stay awake and focus."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_40,"Your leader... must be a really patient man."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_41,"Excuse me, but is this poison store closed already?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_42,"................................................................"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_43,"Lorraine, what are you doing here?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_44,"Oh, that's Lorraine! Wow! The sage's in Orvel! Rephy was right all along!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_45,"Oddy? Long time, no see. How have you been? I drop by here to buy some poisons."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_46,"The poison made by the alchemist here works pretty well when it comes to killing demons."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_47,"Is that... a Tamian... right next to you?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_48,"Yeah! I'm Rephy! I'm a Spiritual Guide!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_49,"So, you're a sage blessed by the Queen of Blue Star. I am Lorraine, the Elf Sage. It is my greatest honor to meet you."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_50,"Wait! This kid... is really that great?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_51,"Ahem! Rephy is always great! Right, Sage Lorraine! Oh! Which way is the Misty Hills?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_52,"I should go there to light up the way for lost souls with this lamp!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_53,"Misty Hills... There's two places like that left in this kingdom."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_54,"Galluah Plains and Ogria Mountain. However, those places are completely dark without any starlight at all... You might run into demons there."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_55,"I can't tell... if the Misty Hills are safe now."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_56,"It's okay! Rephy will go and check it out! Which Misty Hills are closer?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_57,"From Orvel? The one in Galluah Plains is nearer."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_58,"But like I said, that place is full of dark souls... There won't be any souls of light to help you."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_59,"Rephy is strong! No matter how dark the place is, I'll guide them all with this lamp."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_60,"Lorraine... From my experience with this kid, you won't be able to change his mind."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_61,"Then... May Misty Hills be lit up with the blessings of Blue Star without any problems."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_62,"Be aware of the darkness, Spiritual Guide."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_63,"Yeah! Thank you! Bye, everyone! Rephy's going now!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_64,"Leaving like that? For a hybrid animal, you sure have a one-track mind. Hm, come here a sec!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_65,"Augh! It hurts! Uncle Oddy! Why'd you pull out some of my tail hair?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_66,"Wait for me! And I need your tail hair so I can always find you with my time magic!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_67,"Today, I made you waste your time, bringing you to the labyrinth."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_68,"I don't like owing anybody anything. I will definitely pay you back the time you lost."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_69,"Wow! Then, we'll meet again, right?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_70,"Yes, Rephy. So, don't get hurt. And if you call my name when you're in danger..."
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_71,"Alright, I'm going! Bye, Uncle Oddy! Bye, Sage!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_72,"Kid... You really can't stop treating me like I'm one of your kid buddies, can you? Ha ha ha!"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_73,"But... What are you, exactly, Uncle Oddy?"
Sub1_Rephy_2_6_74,"Do me a favor. Just forget about it, please."
Sub1_Rephy_3_1_1,"*Sniff* I can smell something nasty... Only dark souls exist here."
Sub1_Rephy_3_1_2,"I should be able to find some Misty Hills around here... But I can't tell exactly where!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_1_3,"Right! I should ask God's Lamp! Where are the Misty Hills?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_1_4,"Wow! There! Let's go together!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_1_5,"............???????"
Sub1_Rephy_3_2_1,"Huh? I smell something from somewhere... Rephy took a bath only 3 months ago... Is it me?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_2_2,"Rephy... smells? No! My scent is good!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_2_3,"This nasty smell... It's the demons!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_3_1,"Urgh... Too many demons... I feel bad. Souls of light, help me!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_3_2,"No one's here... There's no souls of light to help Rephy..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_3_3,"No way! Someone should come!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_3_4,"Who... who called... me..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_3_5,"Huh? Who are you?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_3_6,"Jane... Gray..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_4_1,"Who... are you? I... just called the souls of light."
Sub1_Rephy_3_4_2,"But... you smell like demons there..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_4_3,"I am Jane... Your voice... I heard it in my head..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_4_4,"(It's weird... I can definitely smell demons... but there's very weak energy from souls of light...)"
Sub1_Rephy_3_4_5,"Dangerous... Get back! We should get rid of the demons!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_1,"Are you not... hurt?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_2,"(I can't tell if she's a soul of light... But she saved my life, anyway...)"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_3,"No! Thanks for your help! I'm Rephy! Do you know about the Tamian Tribe?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_4,"Tamian Tribe... I... don't know many things..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_5,"I have no idea of what I like, or if I have a family... I know nothing."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_6,"Huh? But you just told me that you're Jane Gray."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_7,"That's a really nice name!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_8,"Jane... Is it really that nice?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_9,"Yeah! Yeah! And you fight really well! I've never seen anyone as strong as Jane!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_10,"Awesome!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_11,"Now I know... that Jane is wonderful and awesome..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_12,"Still... I want to know... who I am..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_13,"Oh... Did you lose your memory?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_14,"If you had a stronger soul of light... I could help you."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_15,"But why are you here alone in this creepy place? Don't you have any friends?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_16,"There was one, but he disappeared suddenly... saying something interesting came up..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_17,"I was told this place was... my home. We came here together, hoping something might help my memory come back..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_18,"That person is bad! If you came here together, that person shouldn't have abandoned!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_19,"....... Oh... It wasn't a person... It was a demon..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_20,"Huh? A demon?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_21,"(Ah... I'm getting more confused about who she really is... Still, I can feel that she has a soul of light.)"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_22,"(I can't leave someone who has no memories alone like this... Alright!)"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_23,"Jane! Do you want to come with me? Rephy is looking for Misty Hills!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_24,"Misty Hills...?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_25,"Yeah! I'll light up the Starlight Bridge there with God's Lamp! That way, the lost souls can go where they need to go."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_26,"Bright light... Jane... likes light..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_5_27,"Alright. Let's go, then!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_1,"God's Lamp! Where are Misty Hills?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_2,"This way! Hurry up!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_3,"I have seen that light... a light of soul... Blue light glows upon a twinkling bridge..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_4,"I was following the light... Someone... pulled me down... to the dark and cold place..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_5,"The darkness with no one else... I won't go there again..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_6,"(She knows the Starlight Bridge... She's died before...)"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_7,"(Someone forced a soul heading to the Blue Star into the darkness... and resurrected her...)"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_8,"Yeah! You won't go there again! Rephy will guide you with this lamp!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_9,"Trust me! I'm a great spiritual guide, the Tamian sage!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_6_10,"Okay..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_1,"Uh? What is this? It looks like part of a big building. Ah! I saw this in Orvel! The castle!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_2,"Kings, princesses, and knights live in a castle, right?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_3,"But... it's all crumbled. I think demons came here too."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_4,"I... know this place..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_5,"Really? Can you remember anything?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_6,"Here... many people... were dressed up beautifully... and were dancing..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_7,"So bright with the lights... and music... the waltz that I love..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_8,"People asked me to dance with them... But I didn't want to dance with anybody else but him."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_9,"I was waiting... I kept waiting for...? Who was I waiting for...?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_10,"Jane..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_11,"I can't remember... who he was..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_12,"Hey! Hey! But we now know something now!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_13,"You have someone you like!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_14,"Like... someone...?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_15,"Yeah! You waited for him to dance together!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_16,"That's your most important memory! It's the person you like, Jane!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_17,"I... like someone... I came to learn... at least one thing... about myself."
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_18,"Wow! Great work, Jane!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_7_19,"Yes... Thank you."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_1,"*Sniff* I can smell the star shadow! There must be some Misty Hills ahead!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_2,"Then... we should take a rest here!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_3,"We won't keep going?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_4,"Yeah! Make haste slowly... Um? Is that what our leader taught me? Oh, well."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_5,"We came a long way, so now we need to rest."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_6,"In the Blue Star, there's a garden of rest―a home for souls."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_7,"And there is a huge―very huge―meteor dragon, too."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_8,"It's alright that the way there is dark. This God's Lamp will give us light."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_9,"What... was that...?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_10,"Oh! I made a song for myself. Isn't it cool?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_11,"Not... really. My ears hurt."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_12,"Yeah! I know. Rephy's bad at singing! Completely tone-deaf!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_13,"But it's alright! This is an invincible song!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_14,"An invincible song?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_15,"I heard Rephy was blessed by the Queen of Blue Star. So, the leader and the other Tamians are counting on me."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_16,"Now, they finally have a spiritual guide in Lamp-keeper Town! Someone is here to light up God's Lamp!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_17,"But, for a long time, Rephy couldn't do any of that."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_18,"Whenever the leader taught me something, I forgot it. And I couldn't light up God's Lamp."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_19,"So I was afraid. I was afraid that they might hate me."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_20,"And then...?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_21,"But they didn't. The leader and the other Tamians trusted me."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_22,"They taught me again when I forgot, and they never got disappointed when I couldn't light up the lamp."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_23,"So Rephy did his best!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_24,"I studied the duties of a spiritual guide by making songs and singing them every day."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_25,"And I tried to read the flow of the souls with God's Lamp day and night. Then one day, the lamp was lit up!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_26,"Rephy could be the spiritual guide because of the Tamians who kept trusting me."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_27,"I see... Someone who trusts you..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_28,"I don't have anyone... who would wait for me, who'd believe in me... I'm just Jane Gray..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_29,"No! That's not true, Jane! You think no one believes in you!?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_30,"You have me! The Spiritual Guide Rephy!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_31,"You? Why...?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_32,"What are you talking about? You and me, we're friends! Friends trust each other!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_33,"Rephy and me... We're friends... I also have someone that... trusts me."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_34,"Yeah! Yeah! I, Sage Rephy, am Jane Gray's Number One friend! Huh? Maybe I'm Number Two? Or even Number Three?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_35,"Ho ho! Yes... You're right. Rephy is Jane's Number One friend."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_36,"Wow! I'm your Number One friend! That's awesome!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_37,"Umm...? Ah, Jane... I'm feeling sleepy now. I walked too much today..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_38,"Alright... Good night, Rephy."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_39,"Here, take this place beside the fire. It's warm! Good night, Jane!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_40,"Zzz..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_41,"Someone... trusts you..."
Sub1_Rephy_3_8_42,"Thank you... Spiritual Guide. My Number One friend, Rephy."
Sub1_Rephy_3_9_1,"Zzz... Go away! Zzz... Don't touch my tail!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_9_2,"Huh, what...? Phew. It was just a dream."
Sub1_Rephy_3_9_3,"Good morning, Jane! Slept well last night?"
Sub1_Rephy_3_9_4,"Jane's... gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye."
Sub1_Rephy_3_9_5,"Nope, nope. I shouldn't be feeling too bad about it. We're friends!"
Sub1_Rephy_3_9_6,"We'll definitely meet again! Rephy should better head to Misty Hills!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_1_1,"God's Lamp! Are we at Misty Hills now?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_1_2,"But... there are only dark souls here, and they all smell like evil dead."
Sub1_Rephy_4_1_3,"No, no way! There should be Misty Hills here!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_1_4,"Let's find out. Lamp! Light up!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_1_5,"Misty Hills... Destroy them all..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_1_6,"Souls of... light... Pull them... to the darkness..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_1,"Too many demons... It's hard to fight... Souls of light! Help me!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_2,"There's no souls of light... in Misty Hills..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_3,"Help me! Leader! Uncle Oddy! Jane!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_4,"They can't come over here... Rephy is... scared, all by himself."
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_5,"Huh? Did you call me, Rephy?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_6,"Uncle Oddy! You came! Wow! It's Uncle Oddy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_7,"Ha ha. Didn't I tell you to call me when you're in danger... Oh, you really are in trouble!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_8,"Alright! Let's hang in there until backup arrives!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_9,"Backup? Someone's coming, too?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_10,"Of course, he'll come. If he doesn't show up this time, he won't hear the end of it from me."
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_11,"Let's go, Rephy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_2_12,"Yeah! Uncle Oddy! Rephy's ready!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_1,"Typical Undeads... They just don't stop coming..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_2,"I really think they don't like your God's Lamp."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_3,"Why? Rephy needs to light this up to help the lost souls go to the Blue Star!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_4,"Hmm... Those Undeads can't go to the Blue Star because they're stained with darkness."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_5,"They have no other choice... but to wander around in the darkness like that."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_6,"Can't let go... Won't let... souls of light... go to the Blue Star..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_7,"Join us... in the dark abyss... and eternal... pain..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_8,".........................................................."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_9,"When is that guy gonna get here?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_10,"I'm here now! Phew. There's so many places that need me."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_11,"I'm always busy, you know. But I can't let down a friend!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_12,"Huh. If you have time to show off, get rid of those undeads over here."
Sub1_Rephy_4_3_13,"As you wish!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_1,"Return to the abyss now!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_2,"Mister! Wait!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_3,"What's up, fur boy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_4,"Rephy! Why'd you just call him Mister? And you, Nyx! He has a name, and it's not fur boy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_5,"Oh, yes! I suppose you're right... Rephy! What's the matter?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_6,"I... have something to do."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_7,"I'm sorry... but I can't let those other souls of light lose their way!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_8,"Rephy will do his best! To stop the lost souls from heading to the abyss!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_9,"Shut up... Anyway... we... can't... go back... to the Blue Star..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_10,"No! There's a way!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_11,"Take this! The guide's soul light!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_12,"If you have this, you can find your way to the Blue Star, even in the abyss."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_13,"Isn't that... your soul? Rephy?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_14,"Yeah! This is the soul light made of Rephy's soul!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_15,"With this guide's soul light, everyone will know where the Blue Star is!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_16,"Uh... Kid...? You really shouldn't be giving away parts of your soul that easily."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_17,"It's alright! Rephy's strong! And the souls always help me!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_18,"Interesting! I've met several spiritual guides, but none of them are as reckless as this boy."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_19,"Are you impressed? You should stop him from doing that!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_20,"It's alright. Rephy will be fine... after taking... a nap."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_21,"We don't need... something like... a soul of a hairy creature..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_22,"You... should keep your promise... Spiritual... Guide..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_23,"All the dark souls... disappeared..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_24,"I don't sense the demons anymore. They just left on their own...?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_25,"Alright! Then, we should light up Misty Hills!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_26,"Are you ready? Rephy?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_27,"Yeah! Rephy's always ready!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_28,"The successor of Giacobini―the great Sentinel of Blue Star,"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_29,"the Keeper of God's Lamp commands―"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_30,"(Whisper) Hey, Oddy! Is that... a ritual... or something? I only hear a weird song that's hurting my ears?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_31,"(Whispers) I... can't really tell... since I haven't seen... this before, but..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_32,"(Whispers) I'm sure of one thing... He's a lot stronger than I thought..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_33,"Here, in the darkest Misty Hills―"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_34,"light up for the lost souls―leading them to Starlight Bridge!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_35,"Let the blue starlight shine on the whole world! God's Lamp!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_36,"Wow! This is magnificent."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_37,"I have to agree. We've lived such a long time, but..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_38,"I've never seen something like this before... Life sure can be interesting."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_39,"Right. No matter how long you live, life somehow finds a way to surprise you."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_40,"By the way, are you still looking for a way to be a human again?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_41,"Of course! I need to find the leader of the Redpurs, but... I can't even find a single one of them... Tsk."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_42,"Well, I like the way you look right now. Kind of cute, don't you think so? Uncle Oddy?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_43,"If you're saying that, I'm guessing you don't need my time magic for your research anymore."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_44,"Just kidding. You cannot feel bad about just one mistake made in my warp experiment."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_45,"Well, forget it. Ironically, I met Rephy thanks to that. Umm? Right! Rephy! Are you okay?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_46,"Yeah, yeah! Rephy finally made Misty Hills so bright!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_47,"The Spiritual Guide Rephy! Wow! I think I did a really great job!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_48,"Kid... You're not tired at all. Good work, Rephy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_49,"Yeah! I guess not so many souls will be getting lost now!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_50,"Umm? That actually seems true... I can see that the World of Light is getting... less chaotic."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_51,"Well, it's almost time to leave, so we better hurry. Oddy! Get ready, we should go!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_52,"Alright, alright. He's so impatient... I'll be the only one who understands that... *Sigh*"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_53,"Hey, Rephy! I'll have to say goodbye for now."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_54,"Because of you, I got to see something really wonderful. Thank you!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_55,"I was really happy to be with you, too! You're really cool, Uncle Oddy! You're a great friend!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_56,"Ha ha ha! I've never been friends with a kid like you before! Huh! Yeah, you're my buddy, Rephy."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_57,"So, Spiritual Guide, may I ask you where you're heading now?"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_58,"To Ogria Mountain! I'll look for more Misty Hills there!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_59,"Will you be alright by yourself? There will be many demons, too."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_60,"Rephy's not alone. I have lots of friends!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_61,"Whenever I get tired or exhausted, friends and souls always help me!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_62,"Of course. And whenever you're in danger, call me... no, call Uncle Oddy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_63,"Are you not going? The portal will be closing soon."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_64,"Alright! Well, goodbye now! Till we meet again..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_65,"Yeah! Bye, Uncle Oddy! See you!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_66,"No matter where you are... We'll always be friends..."
Sub1_Rephy_4_4_67,"Ha ha... We sure had a lot of fun, Rephy!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_1,"Guide of Blue Star"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_2,"Behind every life is a soul."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_3,"And souls may become friends"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_4,"or enemies!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_5,"But you know...!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_6,"We all came from one place!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_7,"We were all together at the Blue Star, the home of souls."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_8,"In the far future, when we return home again,"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_9,"let's sing and dance all day in the warm garden!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_10,"When you feel alone and tired,"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_11,"look for the Blue Star up in the sky."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_12,"Someone else under the sky will"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_13,"look for that same star, just like you."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_14,"We are all travelers from the Blue Star."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_15,"Call Rephy when you get lost."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_16,"I'll let you know"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_17,"where the Blue Star is,"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_18,"and where your friends are."
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_19,"Now! Take my hand!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_20,"Spiritual Guide Rephy will be always with you!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_21,"Okay, let's go!"
Sub1_Rephy_4_5_22,"To be continued..."
