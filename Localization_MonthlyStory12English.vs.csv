E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_01,...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_02,"Now, this... brings back feelings."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_03,"It’s meaningless, but something I don't want to let go..."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_04,This obscure feeling... is lingering inside my head.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_05,"(Here, in this frozen land, Arlette’s body will rest forever.)"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_06,(Only the still frozen corpse... will remain in her stead.)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_07,(But...)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_08,Such cold...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_09,I thought the frozen wind of this place could never touch me...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_10,This extreme cold that is enough to freeze my bones... It’s invading my every skin.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_11,"When I woke up, it was going to be the ninetieth winter."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_12,And... today is the hundredth winter.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_13,... Now I see.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_14,He pointed his spear at me even though he knew he could die...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_15,It was out of sad desperation that even the exploited heart from all the constant waiting
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_16,could not even dismiss.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_17,Though I have to say that his feeling of longing...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_18,and mine are clearly different.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_19,Being different
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_20,means the weight of pain to endure is also different...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_21,(A feeling of wanting to see someone who might be alive...)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_22,(And a feeling of saying farewell to someone who will never return...)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_23,I am worried about you.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_24,"We are here with you now,"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_25,"But if we leave, you will be left all alone again, right?"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_26,(Yes... I remember.)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_27,(You came here with survivors of a fallen nation. You were exhausted and weak.)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_28,(But you were different from other humans.)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_29,"(Even though I treated you as a nuisance and tried to drive you out, you always treated me kindly.)"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_30,"(To be honest, there were many times when I was annoyed with you...)"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_31,(But those conversations we had... They were quite meaningful.)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_32,That reminds me.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_33,"You told me what you put inside those cookies you made, and how you met Kyle..."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_34,You told me about those places Kyle took you and Maria to...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_35,"To think back, all the conversations were about your personal life."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_36,(But listening to her speak... Those conversations weren't boring.)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_37,"Hey, Pavel..."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_38,I hope... you meet someone who understands...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_39,What was that? That felt like a very important piece of memory...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_40,...No one’s around.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_41,No words from Lewisia too...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_42,and where’s Rodina?
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_43,Hehehe. The search ended rather quick.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_44,Hope Pavel likes this one!
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_45,Rodina.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_46,"Oh, Pavel, you were here first! It’s good that you are here. I have something-"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_47,Pavel?
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_48,...The blizzard is strong today. You should come back early in days like this.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_49,"Wow, were you actually worried about me, Pavel?"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_50,It’s okay. I had some things to take care of in the village. That’s all.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_51,I have something I wish to give you.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_52,Something to give me?
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_53,"Happy birthday, Pavel! You were looking a bit down as of recent. I prepared something special to cheer you up."
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_54,Birthday?
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_55,"You told me a while ago, remember?"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_56,That you were congratulated around this time of the year in the past.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_57,That only explains one thing: Your birthday is today.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_58,...Wait... Don't tell me I got it all wrong.
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_59,"I hope that one day,"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_60,you would find someone who understands you other than me...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_61,I hope you find someone who gets angry for you and gets you gifts from time to time...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_62,I hope you find someone like that who will stay by your side...
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_63,"(Now I remember... Arlette, she... told me that in the past.)"
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_64,(Someone who understands... and stays by my side...)
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_65,...Pavel?
E_C19_Dec_Pavel01_66,I will put it to good use.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_01,.....
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_02,"It’s been a while, Rodina. Bit sad though, that you are getting transferred to a new post on your birthday."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_03,"Sergeant Rodina Klein! It is an honor to serve, Vice Commander Fluss!"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_04,"Hey, hey, easy there. No need to get so tight out in private."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_05,"T-then... It’s been a while, Fluss."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_06,Uh-huh. So what brings you here? Are you here for your gift? Or is it the mission you were assigned to?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_07,"Ah, I-I do not need any presents. I visited you for the mission."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_08,"I definitely heard that it’s an escort mission,"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_09,"but the more I look into it after accepting it, this mission... It’s..."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_10,"Yeah, you are basically monitoring him."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_11,.....
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_12,"You do know who you are moni- pardon me, escorting, right?"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_13,"Yes, sir. I heard that he is a very powerful wizard whom the Empire is keeping eyes on."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_14,Correct. There’s no one in the Empire who can defeat him in his magic range. At least until now.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_15,That’s why the Empire gave you this order.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_16,"As the best sniper in the Empire, you can easily snipe him outside his magic range."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_17,.....
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_18,"I know what you are thinking; that you picked up your rifle not to kill people, but to protect them."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_19,"If it’s that, then don't worry."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_20,Just be yourself and do your job as a soldier like you always have.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_21,"I... see. Understood, sir. I shall do my best to successfully conclude this mission, sir."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_22,It’s pretty... far... and pretty... cold too!
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_23,A Wizard of Ice Dragon that lives in a place like this...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_24,.....
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_25,.........That must be him...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_26,"Salutations, I am Rodina Klein, Sergeant First Class. The Empire dispatched me here."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_27,Are you Pavel?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_28,...Yes.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_29,I am here to fulfill my duty as your escort. Pleased to meet you.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_30,"...I don’t really need escorting, but fair enough."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_31,Just a reminder: I hate noisy people. Keep this in mind.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_32,Understood!
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_33,I have a feeling that this mission will not be an easy one.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_34,I’m worried if I will be able to befriend him...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_35,"Rodina, are you here?"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_36,"Good day, Yanne! Welcome."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_37,What brings you here this time?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_38,So I received this mission from a high-ranking official of the Empire.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_39,He told me to hand you his birthday present.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_40,A present from a high-ranking official? Could it be...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_41,Tcha!
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_42,This is all... for me?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_43,Yep. Though not all of them are from him.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_44,Here. Some letters for you.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_45,I knew it was from Fluss.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_46,.....Again with these corny remarks... As expected...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_47,And these are... from my family.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_48,All of this? That’s a lot. Mind if I have a look?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_49,Oh... So you are the youngest daughter of a big family. No wonder you have so many letters delivered to you!
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_50,And um... I also have something to give you.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_51,You would like to give me something?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_52,Sorry it’s something cheap. I prepared it rather hastily. Happy birthday.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_53,"No, no, don’t apologize. Thank you so much for this!"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_54,"Oh, look at this mountain of presents. Don't tell me the birthday party is over so soon."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_55,"Lewisia? Come in, come in. How did you know it was my birthday today?"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_56,"Well, someone asked me what do you usually give for birthdays. I naturally figured it out that it was someone’s birthday."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_57,"Here you go. Happy birthday, Rodina."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_58,Huh? Wow... I can’t believe I just got a present from the princess...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_59,It is thanks to you that Pavel is doing much much better.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_60,"It’s something even his old friends, us, couldn’t do."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_61,I-I’m honored by your compliment... Thank you sincerely.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_62,...Noisy.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_63,"Oh, Pavel. Was it too noisy?"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_64,It's okay... Happy birthday.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_65,"Hmm? Well, this is something I didn’t expect to see... You didn't follow my advice."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_66,...I did take note of it. I just thought this would fit Rodina more.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_67,Hmmm...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_68,......I remember......
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_69,Um... Sorry to bother you...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_70,...What is it?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_71,Well... Today is my birthday...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_72,...So?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_73,My family sent me a cake. Would you like to have some?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_74,No.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_75,O... kay...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_76,"Pavel, are you home?"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_77,What is it?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_78,I received a birthday cake.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_79,Would you like to have some?
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_80,...I refuse.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_81,Understood...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_82,"I remember that at first, you rarely responded to me and avoided my questions."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_83,"However, as time went by, you started listening to me,"
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_84,and responded every time I spoke to you.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_85,"Although it may not be much, but ultimately, you’ve changed a lot, Pavel."
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_86,If what Lewisia said about you being much better is this...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_87,And to think that my efforts contributed to that improvement...
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_88,This is an excellent present by itself.
E_C19_Dec_Rodina01_89,"....That said, I think he'll say yes this time..."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_01,"Dammit, why aren't there any strong Demons here?"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_02,What a waste of time... It’s been like this for a while. How frustrating.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_03,"...I’m gonna get rid of this frustration by eating something tasty. To the village, I go."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_04,...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_05,"What’s wrong with me today? The food doesn't taste good, and I feel rather depressed."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_06,...What a bad day. I don't even want to eat a Demon.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_07,"Hey, mister, let me ask you something."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_08,What day... of what month is today?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_09,...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_10,Hey. Human!
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_11,"Wake up, human!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_12,HEY!! Vi!!
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_13,Hmm? Huh?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_14,*Sigh* Seriously..
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_15,Why are you always like this on this particular day of the year?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_16,Oh... I’m sorry...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_17,This is why I don’t like human emotions.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_18,"Look, I know today is the day your village was burned to the ground,"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_19,"all the people you knew were killed,"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_20,and your body was torn to pieces.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_21,But you are alive here and now.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_22,You even have the power for vengeance now.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_23,What is it then? You need something more?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_24,...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_25,"Hey! I’m talking to you, human!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_26,"Ah, to hell with it. What should I freaking do?!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_27,"Huh? Oh, it’s Crab Legs."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_28,Hmm? Do you know that person?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_29,"Person? Well, she’s someone like me."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_30,I thought I told you about her before. The one I met at Dragia Volcano.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_31,"She looks quite upset today, though."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_32,"Hey, Crab Legs!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_33,You are eating so much as usual.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_34,How do you eat that much with such a small human stomach?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_35,"Huh? Oh, it’s the Half Breed."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_36,I’m not feeling so good today. Don’t you pick a fight.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_37,...Something wrong?
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_38,Your face looks 10 times angrier than usual.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_39,...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_40,It’s the human host who’s making me real annoyed.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_41,Humans... They just don’t let go of what they lost and cry and lament over it...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_42,Pathetic creatures...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_43,You really are an idiot.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_44,You should apologize to her. This is clearly your fault.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_45,"Hey, don't blame me!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_46,And why should I? I said nothing wrong!
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_47,You should just let go of-
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_48,You forged a possession contract with that girl! You are responsible for your host!
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_49,"When I asked Epis, she told me most possessions are done forcibly."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_50,"...Come on, that’s different. It’s done to make an example out of arrogant-"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_51,"Ah, what the hell! Look, I don't care about what situation you are in,"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_52,"and I’m clearly not an expert at that area,"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_53,but just think about it: You are angry and annoyed about something.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_54,"The problem is, you have no means to resolve those feelings. How would you feel?"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_55,...Tsk.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_56,Understand? Then solve it!
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_57,Stupid glutton...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_58,"...Ah, screw this!!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_59,"I’m gonna teach you a lesson next time we meet, Half Breed..."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_60,"HEY!! We need to talk, human!"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_61,...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_62,"Well, um..."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_63,"Uh... Ah, whatever."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_64,"If you are really not feeling so good today,"
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_65,then how about this? I will give you control over this body for today.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_66,Do as you will. I’m not going to interfere.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_67,Go back to your hometown and see your family’s graves or something.
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_68,"Be thankful for this. You are not supposed to have control now, but I’m breaking the contract rules just this time."
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_69,*Grumble...*
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_70,...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_71,Hometown...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_72,Mom... Dad...
E_C19_Dec_Viska01_73,"...Thank you, Viska..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_1,"Your birthday should be a happy day, but you don't look happy."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_2,That’s why I will give you this.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_3,Princess must laugh. Only then others can all laugh.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_4,Flower. I’m glad it’s still fresh.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_5,"Ah, to think of it, it’s been some time since my birthday passed..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_6,You've always protected me and gave me precious gifts.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_7,I’m afraid I returned nothing to you. How shameful of me...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_8,Not true. Princess gave me name.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_9,"Princess gave me mission. ...Princess forgave me, who tried to kill her."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_10,Princess gave me everything. Princess gave a lot.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_11,...Haha. I am happy to hear that.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_12,But now is now.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_13,Think about what you want.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_14,"Be it a holiday, money... anything..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_15,"If it’s something I can give, then I will give it to you."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_16,"That is, at this journey’s end."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_17,...Hard. It’s like a homework Demia gives to me.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_18,Hahaha. Think hard.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_19,What I want to receive...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_20,What I need... What I want to get...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_21,Hmm...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_22,"Ugh, where did he go?!"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_23,Captain Demia will scold us if we are too late...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_24,There! Found you! Chase!!
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_25,"Huh? Hey, Chase..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_26,Is he sleeping standing up?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_27,Chase!!
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_28,...Clause.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_29,Don't sleep here like this. You are going to catch a cold.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_30,What happened? Did the captain scold you again? Were you feeling down about it?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_31,No. I was just thinking-
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_32,......Too late......
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_33,Late?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_34,The princess told me to think about what I want to receive.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_35,Too hard... I was thinking about it all day. The day is gone.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_36,Haha... It really is a difficult task.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_37,(Hm... Perhaps she wanted to give something in return for her birthday present.)
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_38,"If it’s too hard thinking about what you want to receive,"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_39,then how about something you like?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_40,"Something like food. You like food, no?!"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_41,......Something I like......
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_42,I know.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_43,Yes! Then you can tell that to Her High-
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_44,My name. I like my name.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_45,...Huh?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_46,I like the pauldron Demia gave me.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_47,I like the handkerchief princess gave me.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_48,"I like patrolling, escorting, Clause, Loman, Demia, Princess..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_49,I like them all.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_50,.....Maybe Demia is a bit scary.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_51,Hahahaha! Captain really is scary when she's angry.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_52,Okay. Found the answer. I go to princess now.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_53,Princess is waiting. Have to go back before too late.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_54,"Huh? Hey, wait!!"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_55,Haha... Interesting...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_56,It should be fine like this.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_57,Her Highness will be happy to hear that from Chase.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_58,"I told him to think, not to wander somewhere..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_59,I sent Clause to get him. They will be back soon.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_60,...If Clause takes too long to find him or if Chase attacks-
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_61,Rest your worries. Such things will not happen.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_62,You should know very well that he is no longer dangerous.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_63,But...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_64,"The hour is getting late, and it’s dinner time. We should prepare food."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_65,"Allow me to perform that task, Your Highness."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_66,I will not stay idle and wait for them to come.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_67,Alright. I shall leave it to you then.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_68,Princess!!
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_69,Chase. Where were you venturing off-
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_70,I found it. Something I like.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_71,Hmm? Something you like...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_72,Good. Do tell. What is it you like the most?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_73,A lot of things.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_74,I like my name.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_75,...What?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_76,"My name. Patrolling. Princess, Demia. Clause. Loman."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_77,Handkerchief princess gave me. Walking with princess. Escorting princess.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_78,"Now now, that’s enough..."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_79,Was that the reason why you were late? Trying to come up with those thoughts?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_80,Clause helped. I thought hard.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_81,...Haha...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_82,Hahahaha.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_83,Princess?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_84,...I said something wrong?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_85,No. Not at all.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_86,Thank you for telling me that.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_87,Now then... You thought hard about it. You deserve to be rewarded.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_88,Your name... Things you like...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_89,"Chase. From now on, your name is Chase."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_90,......Chase...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_91,My name.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_92,"If you don't remember anything,"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_93,then I will give you the reason to live.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_94,Live for me.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_95,...Yes... That should do.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_96,That?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_97,"I gave you your name, and now you started a new life with it."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_98,There should be a day to celebrate it.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_99,I hereby declare this day as your birthday. How is that?
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_100,...Birthday...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_101,Another gift from princess...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_102,I like it. I like it very much.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_103,"Anything from princess is good,"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_104,but this is as good as my name.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_105,I’m glad you like it.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_106,"Then, although it’s a bit late in the evening, we should prepare a birthday party."
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_107,I should tell Demia to cook more food.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_108,I am Chase.
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_109,"No matter what happens, even if I get my memory back,"
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_110,I will stay beside those I like. With her...
E_C19_Dec_Chase01_111,"Forever and always, as Chase."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_01,"Happy birthday, Esker!"
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_02,I um... prepared a small gift for you!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_03,My birthday is nothing special. I’m surprised you remembered it.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_04,Of course I have to remember an important day like this!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_05,...
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_06,"Now, whenever my birthday approaches, it brings back the memory of that time as a dream..."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_07,Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_08,Nevermind. I’m happy that you prepared a gift for me. Haha.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_09,That’s one of the cards you use.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_10,"It’s not the same card that you use, but tarot cards are interesting friends too."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_11,I specially engraved today’s date behind this one for you.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_12,Also... One more thing!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_13,Hmm?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_14,I will show you how I shuffle. It’s that method you taught me!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_15,Get ready to be enchanted by this spectacle! Hehe.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_16,I remember you being quite awkward with shuffling. You seem confident now.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_17,Of course! I practiced it again and again!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_18,"Just watch! Like this, like that, anddd!!"
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_19,Ta-da!!! Huh?!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_20,W-why?! Again! Again!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_21,Ta-da!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_22,Huh??
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_23,Ta-da!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_24,Why?! Why isn't this working?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_25,Ah...
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_26,Um... So... uh... This worked perfectly moments ago...
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_27,This worked perfectly moments ago...
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_28,That really was a spectacle.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_29,"Don't tease me, Esker!"
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_30,Haha. I really meant it.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_31,Give them to me.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_32,Let me show you again.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_33,Don’t you get tired of dreaming the same dream again and again?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_34,Now it feels like you are just entering the dream on your own volition.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_35,Why is my gut never wrong?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_36,I will never get used to your uncomfortable disguise of me.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_37,"Well, this is the coolest look I can display."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_38,"If you don't like it, then how about this?"
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_39,Get out of my dream.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_40,That’s harsh.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_41,But the dimension you’ve created is my playground.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_42,"Haha, how brazen."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_43,Not as brazen as you by the gambling table.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_44,I would like to suggest one thing. Don't go to that place tomorrow.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_45,A birthday should be an enjoyable day.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_46,"Hm... I know what you are getting at,"
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_47,but my birthday is meaningless now.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_48,A day like that should be celebrated with precious ones. That’s when birthdays shine.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_49,Well... It's up to you to decide.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_50,"Still, it’s a bit sad."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_51,Those precious ones you mentioned
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_52,wouldn't even know that you are denying even the slightest happiness.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_53,Like... That girl just now.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_54,...
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_55,I find your words very thankful and annoying at the same time.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_56,Alright. You win.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_57,I will go somewhere different tomorrow.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_58,[Center of Village]
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_59,A normal day... It’s been too long.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_60,No! I lost again!!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_61,Yuss! Gimme! Gimme!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_62,"Argh, dammit. My precious coins..."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_63,Kehaha! Scrubs!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_64,You are all so bad at this!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_65,Ahaha! I should be able to repay Kibera with this.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_66,?!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_67,Who the hell are you?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_68,"A game, if you would."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_69,Ha! Here comes another loser!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_70,An hour later
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_71,I-is that even possible?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_72,He didn't lose a single game so far.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_73,*Crowd chatter*
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_74,[8 Game Loss Streak]
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_75,Again!!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_76,Aren't you stretching this a bit too far?
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_77,Shut up!!!! 20!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_78,I got 21. I win. Haha.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_79,Ahhhhh!!!

E_C19_Dec_Esker01_86,You dirty cheater!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_87,Haha. It’s not cheating.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_88,It’s luck. You just have to give in to it.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_89,Thank you for giving me an extraordinary gift on this special day.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_90,HEY!!!!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_91,Ah.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_92,??
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_93,Let’s just say I’m giving you this as a token of gratitude.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_94,"I have no use for it, but I feel that this is an essential item for you."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_95,I decided to call it a fortune-bringing chip.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_96,...
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_97,Arghh!!! You piece of-
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_98,Thank you for your kind words.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_99,Ahhhhhh!!! I’m gonna kill you!!!!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_100,Kyaaaa!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_101,Ahhh!! He's gone completely nuts!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_102,"Well, this is bad... Let us conclude the game here. I don’t want to be involved in this mess."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_103,They say fate guides each and every one of us. I’m sure this encounter had its purpose.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_104,"Haha, until next time then."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_105,Where do you think you are going?!!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_106,"Oh, and one more thing. That thing I gave you is quite an expensive one. Try not to lose it. Haha."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_107,STOP!!! GIMME BACK MY MONEY!!!!!!
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_108,"Hahaha. Well, I haven’t had that much fun in a while."
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_109,Feels like this world is still fun. There are a lot of fun things to see and experience.
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_110,(You puzzle me.)
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_111,(How could you give something you won in a secret gambling house to that stranger?)
E_C19_Dec_Esker01_112,(Still... I guess all that matters is that you enjoyed the day.)
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_1,Did you find her?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_2,I-I think... Her Highness has left the palace already.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_3,*Sigh* I can't believe I actually thought she was settled now.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_4,Hurry! Find Her Highness before the words reach the royal guard commander’s ears!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_5,As you command!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_6,Good. It’s going to take some time to find that letter.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_7,"The royal guards will scold me if they find out,"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_8,but I really have to meet him today.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_9,I have to hurry.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_10,"...Um... It's good that I got out of the palace,"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_11,but what now? Where should I go to?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_12,I shouldn’t give up here.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_13,Hmm? This energy... it’s...
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_14,Why are you hesitating so much?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_15,What’s the big deal about this country? Huh?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_16,Did you forget what they said already?!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_17,They told you that they well spare your life but never return!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_18,"Kehaha! They said that as if they were being merciful to you, but they are all just a bunch of pretenders!"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_19,I should have beheaded them while I had the chance!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_20,......Shut up.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_21,Be nice!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_22,I’m your only friend now! You hear me?!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_23,.....
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_24,(So... I really have to leave my nation...)
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_25,(I couldn't even say goodbye to her...)
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_26,(I will never hear her voice again...)
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_27,Bernheim!!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_28,(Yes... I will never hear...)
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_29,(Her voice aga-)
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_30,!?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_31,Your Highness? How did you-
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_32,This is the border zone! Did you come here alone?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_33,There are dangerous monsters running rampant. Why did-
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_34,Enough.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_35,Is that all you have to say?
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_36,"Today is your birthday, Bernheim."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_37,I personally came to congratulate your birthday!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_38,You don’t stop nagging even in a situation like this.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_39,T-that’s... I...
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_40,"......Forgive me, Your Highness....."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_41,"I should punish the sinner. Here, your punishment."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_42,This is...
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_43,An essence of my light.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_44,"It’s nothing special, but it should be useful as a self-defense tool."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_45,"Your Highness, this is too much for me... Why-"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_46,"...What, you don't like it?"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_47,"N-no, that’s not it. It’s just that-"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_48,Kehaha!! Look at you! So weak in front of a puny girl!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_49,I can devour her in one bite!!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_50,So it’s you. The demonic sword that Bernheim took.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_51,"Not afraid of me, huh? Interesting."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_52,Ah-ha! I know! You act all self-righteous and mighty because you have the light behind your back!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_53,Cut the crap. You are the one who exiled him. No use pretendi-
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_54,Argh!!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_55,"Forgive his insolence, Your Highness."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_56,I can't stop that demonic sword because I’m weak and foolish...
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_57,That’s alright. It's actually more fun that way.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_58,I’m also glad to hear from the demonic sword. I have a feeling that he thinks of you quite preciously.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_59,Hmph! Of course! He and I are like one bod-
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_60,Keh!
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_61,...Hahaha.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_62,...Um...
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_63,"...That sword's words have some truth in them, though."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_64,I could neither stop you from getting exiled nor advocate for you.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_65,Your Highness...
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_66,But that’s why
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_67,I will try my best to return you to Penteonia.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_68,"I know it will take long, and everyone will disagree with me."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_69,But I give you my word. I will make it happen.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_70,"I know it may sound shameless, but will you wait for me?"
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_71,"...Yes, Your Highness. I shall wait for you until my last breath."
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_72,Thank you for your trust.
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_73,I should be the one to thank you
E_C19_Dec_Bernheim01_74,for giving me the best birthday present of my life.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_1,"Hey boss, you dropped this!"
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_2,Ahhh!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_3,It’s soaked in blood!!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_4,Why did you have to taint it with your touch?!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_5,Boss! Boss!! Calm down!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_6,Most of our earnings are spent on treating comrades who got beaten by you!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_7,Get lost!! You goons are gonna die fighting anyway! One death doesn't change anything!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_8,Don’t just stand there!! Apologize! Now!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_9,I-I’m sorry!!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_10,I'll kill you! I'm gonna kill you right now!!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_11,Are you okay now?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_12,*Pant...*
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_13,Why did you get so angry?! What's that item to you?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_14,...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_15,"Dayum, that was awesome!"
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_16,It’s so convenient that you don’t even have to load bullets every time!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_17,One shot and booooom!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_18,"This junk, on the other hand, eats bullets like a pig."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_19,...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_20,"W-well, but it’s not all bad, though... I’m satisfied with it..."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_21,It’s just that I feel like I could use a different... weapon sometimes.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_22,...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_23,...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_24,I-I guess I’m just gonna ask Valance to make me a new one...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_25,"What’s with that face, old man?! Seriously! What is it?!"
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_26,Crow?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_27,Did you finish working on that weapon I ordered?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_28,"Oh, I finished that ages ago."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_29,"I have to ask, though... This thing won’t fit your weapon."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_30,Akistra doesn't need a speed loader anyway.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_31,Wait... Is this for his birthday?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_32,...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_33,So you do care about him.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_34,"...He just needs a bit of work, that’s all."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_35,"Sure, sure..."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_36,Die! Die! You die as well!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_37,Get me someone stronger!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_38,Hahahahahahahahaha!!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_39,Huh!? Where do you think you are going?!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_40,I have hundreds of bullets to shoot through your sku-
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_41,"Ah, dammit..."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_42,Done! Time for round two-
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_43,What the? Where did that bastard run off to?!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_44,That son of a!!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_45,Chasers?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_46,Same old losers.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_47,"They died too easily, though. It was so boring."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_48,I could have killed like 15 more of them if reloading wasn’t so inconvenient.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_49,Reloading sucks on this weapon!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_50,I really should ask Valance to make me something.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_51,Huh? Old ma-
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_52,Ouch!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_53,Now quit complaining.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_54,No need for you guys to know.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_55,But I want to hear.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_56,You want to die too?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_57,S-sorry.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_58,"Oh, by the way, a letter was forwarded to you."
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_59,There is something like a wolf on the stamp.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_60,Th-
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_61,This is...
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_62,Boss? Who’s the letter from?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_63,Outta my way! I’m leaving!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_64,Where are you going?!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_65,Hmm? I’m heading off to meet my boss.
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_66,Your boss?! What are you talking about?
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_67,Hey boss!!!
E_C19_Dec_Mitra01_68,Shut up!! SHUT UP!
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_01,Naila... Please take care of our kin...
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_02,Sister......
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_03,I can finally read the flow of wind!
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_04,Maybe I can become a windcaster like you!
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_05,Ahhhhhhh! I think wind spells aren't for me!
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_06,Wind riding is the best. It makes me so happy.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_07,"Maybe I don’t have to become a windcaster as you are already one, sis."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_08,I’m going to become a warrior and protect you!
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_09,"Haha, you will become a fine warrior, Naila."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_10,I was too weak and too helpless back then.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_11,"I couldn’t protect you, sister."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_12,But I will give my all
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_13,to fulfill your promise until the end.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_14,"Naila, take pride. You are a Harpy."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_15,I...
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_16,I need more power.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_17,Hmm? She’s...
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_18,I was right. You were here.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_19,"Everyone's looking for you, Naila."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_20,Princess Selene... Is there a matter so urgent that required you to visit?
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_21,"Oh, yes."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_22,"Your birthday, Naila."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_23,I... don't think it’s something of great importance. You don't have to do so much for this.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_24,"Yes, I do. This is important."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_25,"As the leader of the Harpies, your birthday should be celebrated for the harmony of all races."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_26,It’s nothing to be ashamed of.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_27,But I am still lacking...
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_28,"I am a princess, and I still feel there are areas I’m inadequate at."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_29,"But to think of it, that feeling of inadequacy is what drives me to be better."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_30,I see.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_31,There is actually one important reason why I visited you today.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_32,Please take this. I made a ribbon and enchanted it with the magic of Notos. I want this to help you achieve the things you wish to accomplish.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_33,"As this is just a tiny present, I thought it would be better for me to give this to you"
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_34,before the official celebration.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_35,Th- thank you.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_36,I will never forget your gift and your words.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_37,You will be bombarded with massive gifts and words of celebration today.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_38,You will not even remember that you were given such a small present before that.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_39,Th- that’s not true.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_40,Hahaha. It was just a jest.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_41,"We all know that you will not forget what took place today, Naila."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_42,Now please make your way to the celebration. Everyone’s waiting for you.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_43,(She came to me first to empower me...)
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_44,"Princess Selene, I have a favor to ask of you."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_45,"As the leader of the Harpies, I believe I still lack in strength."
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_46,Will you help me with my training?
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_47,Of course. You need not ask.
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_48,(The wind that Queen Balalaika once blew...)
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_49,(I’m going to surpass it.)
E_C19_Dec_Naila01_50,"Watch over me, Himmullis!"
