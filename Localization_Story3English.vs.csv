E1_Pancironne_1_1_1,"Hurry, hurry!"
E1_Pancironne_1_1_2,Hurry up already!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_3,"Ugh, I'm so bored..."
E1_Pancironne_1_1_4,What's taking everybody so long? It's just digging.
E1_Pancironne_1_1_5,"I mean, how many months have we been at this already?"
E1_Pancironne_1_1_6,Um... Second Lieutenant.
E1_Pancironne_1_1_7,It hasn't even been five minutes since we started working at this site...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_8,And none of us have been able to get any rest for the past couple of days...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_9,Since this is an area where we don't get any energy signals...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_10,I would ask that you give us some more ti...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_11,Why are you still talking?
E1_Pancironne_1_1_12,Pa-pardon?
E1_Pancironne_1_1_13,Burn!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_14,Ahhhhh!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_15,For-forgive me!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_16,This is so annoying!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_17,Do you know how annoying it is having to repeat myself over and over?
E1_Pancironne_1_1_18,Go dig some more if you have time to be making excuses!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_19,Go! Make haste!!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_20,Aghhhh!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_21,Who knew our new superior would be such a crazy maniac?!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_22,I only came because they told me I would be paid big time...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_23,Such hard work...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_24,Without the slightest hint of anything...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_25,Ack! I can't do this anymore!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_26,Just looking at dirt makes me want to throw up!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_27,Please... Let me sleep...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_28,Or at least let me sit for a little while!!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_29,How is this any different from the battlefield?
E1_Pancironne_1_1_30,The battlefield was actually better than this!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_31,I-I can't go on like this anymore!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_32,We're going to die if we keep working like this!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_33,Let's go!!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_34,Here we go again...
E1_Pancironne_1_1_35,We're all dead.
E1_Pancironne_1_1_36,Hmm?
E1_Pancironne_1_1_37,Le-let us rest!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_38,We can't do this anymore— we're exhausted!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_39,"If this is how things are going to be, let us go back to the Empire!"
E1_Pancironne_1_1_40,There isn't anything in these areas you've commanded us to dig!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_41,I would say that this reflects incompetence on the managing part!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_42,Oh?
E1_Pancironne_1_1_43,"Yes! We may be soldiers, but that doesn't mean you can exploit us on meaningless work!"
E1_Pancironne_1_1_44,If you don't listen to what we have to say—
E1_Pancironne_1_1_45,We have no choice but to... to do this!
E1_Pancironne_1_1_46,"Heh, this is going to be fun..."
E1_Pancironne_1_2_1,Who wants to die first?
E1_Pancironne_1_3_1,Ahhhhhhhhh!
E1_Pancironne_1_3_2,"Heheh, how was that just now?"
E1_Pancironne_1_3_3,My butt is on fire!!
E1_Pancironne_1_3_4,"Sick people need medicine, don't they?"
E1_Pancironne_1_3_5,Ta-da! Have some of 'incompetent' Pansirone's special dose of medicine!
E1_Pancironne_1_3_6,Here's another dose! And another one!
E1_Pancironne_1_3_7,Kyahahahah!
E1_Pancironne_1_3_8,Help!!!
E1_Pancironne_1_4_1,Two months after the disbandment of the Hound Unit.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_2,So the Hound Unit has been disbanded after all.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_3,"I wouldn't say the disbandment was entirely uncalled for,"
E1_Pancironne_1_4_4,But it would be a pity to leave them scattered like this.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_5,Especially the head of the unit.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_6,It seems as though the higher-ups of the army have deemed him as dangerous as of right now.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_7,You can't exactly control someone that just lost what was most precious to him.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_8,"Blinded by revenge as he is, whether he poses as a dangerous threat or as an advantageous benefit would be up to how you were to utilize him."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_9,"To me, it only seems as though the higher-ups are just afraid of him because of what they've done."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_10,I can sense something unusual is about to happen.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_11,...
E1_Pancironne_1_4_12,"No matter how I think of it, it's still a pity."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_13,...I think I better pay him a visit sometime soon.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_14,Sir?
E1_Pancironne_1_4_15,"So, where have the other members gone?"
E1_Pancironne_1_4_16,"Uh, yes."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_17,"According to my research, Second Lieutenant Kibera has been transferred to Orvelia following Advisor Idrian's orders."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_18,"I wasn't able to find out the exact reason why, but it seemed like a personal reason."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_19,"From what I've been told, he isn't originally from the Empire."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_20,"If it weren't for his unit's missions, he didn't have any reason to stay."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_21,The army appears to have made the call that he doesn't pose much of a threat. They didn't take any extra measures when he left the country.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_22,That's too bad. He was one of the few who could recognize Veralta's beauty.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_23,Second Lieutenant Mitra has gone missing.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_24,"I heard the army is tracking him down, as he was always known to cause quite the trouble."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_25,That white-head— he's an open book.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_26,The real problem is this one.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_27,Hahaha. This unit really is full of excitement.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_28,Not one of them lets me down.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_29,So did Second Lieutenant Pansirone go back to the division she came from?
E1_Pancironne_1_4_30,"Yes, sir. It looks like she's been reassigned to the Machine Division after the disbandment of the Hound Unit."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_31,But she... Um...
E1_Pancironne_1_4_32,I've been told she is currently unfit to be put on any duty.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_33,"I mean, she was always known to be..."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_34,I can imagine.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_35,"The head of the Hound Unit was, indeed—"
E1_Pancironne_1_4_36,the only person who could really control her.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_37,"Who could take her unpredictable violent temper, with her reigns set loose... Fufufu."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_38,I hear she's throwing a tantrum about how she will only do what she wants to do.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_39,"Headquarters is doing nothing to hide their disapproval,"
E1_Pancironne_1_4_40,"but then again, her abilities are far too dangerous to have her discharged dishonorably..."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_41,"Well, it's not exactly something the royal family needs to concern about."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_42,I guess the army decided it would be better to hold on to her as an ally than to create yet another threat.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_43,"Yes, that seems to be the case."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_44,"From the looks of it, it appears as though they have settled on forcibly assigning her to difficult battles."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_45,"If she were to refuse that as well, then... I assume the only option left for her would be removal."
E1_Pancironne_1_4_46,...
E1_Pancironne_1_4_47,Could that really be the best they could do?
E1_Pancironne_1_4_48,It would be a shame to have her expended after such a short usage.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_49,But there doesn't seem to be any other reasonable options.
E1_Pancironne_1_4_50,Hmm...
E1_Pancironne_1_4_51,I have a good idea.
E1_Pancironne_2_1_0,Six months after the disbandment of the Hound Unit.
E1_Pancironne_2_1_1,Eeeeek! This is so much fun!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_2,Ahahahah!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_3,Yeeee! Next! Next!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_4,"My lady, the context of your smiles seem to be quite inappropriate."
E1_Pancironne_2_1_5,What the-! You scared me!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_6,"Ah, excuse me."
E1_Pancironne_2_1_7,My choice of words in calling you—a soldier in the army— 'lady' seems to have been inappropriate as well.
E1_Pancironne_2_1_8,Who the hell are you?!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_9,I've been sent by the imperial palace to suggest a new assignment for you.
E1_Pancironne_2_1_10,"Oh-ho! The imperial palace, huh?"
E1_Pancironne_2_1_11,Not interested!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_12,"Hmm, this is one assignment you're going to find interesting."
E1_Pancironne_2_1_13,"Yup, that's what all my other useless visitors kept on saying!"
E1_Pancironne_2_1_14,So I gave them all a little taste of fire on the buttocks! Hehe.
E1_Pancironne_2_1_15,I'm in the middle of something really important and am really busy right now.
E1_Pancironne_2_1_16,"Could you go away, please?"
E1_Pancironne_2_1_17,Ahahaha! Hehehehehe!!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_18,"Ah, this book. I just finished reading it recently."
E1_Pancironne_2_1_19,Ahahahahah! Hehehehe!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_20,You're on Volume 28?
E1_Pancironne_2_1_21,Ahahahah! Hehe!!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_22,"The final book, Volume 30, ends the story with the biggest twist.\nThe main character dies because he tripped on his own foot."
E1_Pancironne_2_1_23,Ahah...
E1_Pancironne_2_1_24,.................
E1_Pancironne_2_1_25,*Hiss* Why would you tell me that?!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_26,I was at the good part!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_27,Now it's no fun!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_28,I told you not to bother me!!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_29,What if I were to tell you something far more amusing?
E1_Pancironne_2_1_30,I'M-NOT-INTERESTED!!!!
E1_Pancironne_2_1_31,Here's a load of fire for you!!
E1_Pancironne_2_2_1,You won't regret hearing it.
E1_Pancironne_2_2_2,I don't want to!!
E1_Pancironne_2_2_3,Ah. What a beautiful flame.
E1_Pancironne_2_2_4,"As charming as it may be,"
E1_Pancironne_2_2_5,Do you really think its heat could reach me?
E1_Pancironne_2_2_6,"Wow, just you wait! I'm really going to burn you up!"
E1_Pancironne_2_2_7,Don't beg me later!
E1_Pancironne_2_3_1,Die! Die!!
E1_Pancironne_2_3_2,Burn!!
E1_Pancironne_2_4_1,"Grrrr, why won't you freaking die?!"
E1_Pancironne_2_4_2,Gahhh! This is so annoying!!
E1_Pancironne_2_4_3,Ah. It seems this waltz has run its course.
E1_Pancironne_2_4_4,Let me get back to what I came here for.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_1,"Your skills are indeed, flawless."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_2,We wouldn't want to have them put to waste.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_3,"Ugh, this is so frustrating!"
E1_Pancironne_2_5_4,I heard you've been refusing all of your assignments at the Machine Division.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_5,Don't you dare change the subject!
E1_Pancironne_2_5_6,Then what about excavation?
E1_Pancironne_2_5_7,"Since it's something you've done countless times in your old unit, I assume it would come easy to you."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_8,"Huh, looks like someone did a lot of digging around on my life."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_9,Cree-py.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_10,You could say I tried my hand to win you over.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_11,"Hah, and you think that's going to change my mind?"
E1_Pancironne_2_5_12,Sorry to burst your bubble!
E1_Pancironne_2_5_13,There isn't anything that could interest me now.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_14,The army finds these actions of yours very difficult to deal with.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_15,I think you would have a far better idea than I do regarding what they will do if you don't cooperate with them.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_16,"No, I don't!"
E1_Pancironne_2_5_17,I-haven't-got-a-clue! Bleh!
E1_Pancironne_2_5_18,You will be forced to be a part of an assignment regardless of what you think.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_19,"Wow, that really wouldn't be my cup of tea."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_20,"If worse comes to worst, they may try to remove the uncontrollable soldier."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_21,"Well, tell them to!"
E1_Pancironne_2_5_22,But I wouldn't want that to happen.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_23,"I take extremely good care of talented people, you see."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_24,Even more so for people like you.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_25,Even if they're a little lacking in character.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_26,Ugh! You're really annoying!
E1_Pancironne_2_5_27,I wouldn't think execution would be something the head of the army would want either.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_28,Why would they want to suffer a loss when they could utilize you in so many ways?
E1_Pancironne_2_5_29,What are you talking about?
E1_Pancironne_2_5_30,What I'm saying is that the army could make things go back to the way things were before you met them—
E1_Pancironne_2_5_31,To those times when you— and only you— survived from that horrible place.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_32,"No matter how many times, how many years it takes, they will stop at nothing to recreate the super-soldiers from those times. Their sense of morality is nothing short of trash."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_33,"And all of it started with you, the only survivor."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_34,Wouldn't you say they would think it's a shame to put such a precious resource to waste?
E1_Pancironne_2_5_35,"Ah, of course, that facility no longer exists."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_36,...
E1_Pancironne_2_5_37,Huh. I've had enough of you.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_38,Oh dear. That flame looks ready to pounce at me if I were to say one more word.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_39,I'll stop here for your sake.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_40,But I do want you to think carefully about the offer on excavation.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_41,"Not only is it similar to what you've done before,"
E1_Pancironne_2_5_42,you'll be set free from the army's pressure in the name of the imperial palace's duties.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_43,You would be killing two birds with one stone.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_44,How dare you order me around?!
E1_Pancironne_2_5_45,I am the Vice Commander of the Imperial Knights.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_46,Blah! What do I care?
E1_Pancironne_2_5_47,It means I'm more powerful than you think when it comes to working in the name of the Emperor.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_48,"Ugh, bug off! Get out of here!!"
E1_Pancironne_2_5_49,"This power does come in handy, you know."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_50,"For instance, I could find out how anyone you've parted with is doing."
E1_Pancironne_2_5_51,...
E1_Pancironne_2_5_52,What do you want from me?
E1_Pancironne_2_5_53,I'm only trying to tell you.
E1_Pancironne_2_5_54,You may be surprised what you may be able to find if you were to fulfill your duties compliantly.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_1,Seven months after the disbandment of the Hound Unit.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_2,Your assignment is simple.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_3,Find something in the place I tell you to.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_4,And what would I be looking for?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_5,That has yet to be discovered.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_6,"Wow, soooo simple!"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_7,Why don't you just do it yourself?!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_8,"Unfortunately, this just isn't something I'm able to do, which is why I handpicked you especially."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_9,I hate you.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_10,"The place I'm about to tell you,"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_11,is a place where our high-energy tracking signals for excavation show no reaction at all.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_12,"In short, it's a place where no artifacts could be."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_13,Did you even hear what I just said?!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_14,But the ancient book I've been studying with interest has mentioned\nnone other than that area as an important territory.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_15,"When I went and examined the place myself, it was just as the reports read."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_16,"On top of unable to find any energy signals whatsoever,"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_17,"the terrain was rough, and the weather irritably fickle."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_18,The land was beyond insignificant—it was the worst.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_19,Count me out!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_20,I don't want to do it!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_21,What the heck!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_22,You're just doing this to give me a hard time!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_23,I'm not going to get anything digging through a place like that!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_24,You're right. I wasn't able to find anything—not even an ant.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_25,"I've assigned numerous people to the place since then,"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_26,but without any fruition.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_27,"Scholars have long been sick of it,"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_28,and a considerable number of troops assigned to the excavation abandoned the site.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_29,Officers who are in charge of the site have also been replaced numerous times.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_30,"Huh, is that so?"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_31,And you're telling me this unfortunate little place is my assignment?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_32,Screw it! I'm not doing it!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_33,"Yes, it really is quite unfortunate."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_34,But wouldn't you say your old unit conducted work just like this?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_35,There's also one more reason why I sought after you in particular.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_36,??
E1_Pancironne_3_1_37,The ancient book I've based the excavation on—
E1_Pancironne_3_1_38,A sentence that was recently decrypted from that book changed everything about the situation.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_39,"What, now you're talking about some stupid words?"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_40,"With this one sentence,"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_41,"I was able to figure out why we had never been able to find anything from the land,"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_42,as well as who it was I needed to turn to.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_43,Stop talking in riddles! You're driving me nuts!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_44,'Only those who can see what cannot be seen will be able to reach.'
E1_Pancironne_3_1_45,??
E1_Pancironne_3_1_46,Who could that be?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_47,Perhaps...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_48,Someone who claims to see flames that no one else is able to see?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_49,...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_50,Haha. Look at you.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_51,"I wish you would stop glaring at me like that— it's scary, you know."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_52,Didn't I say I put in quite the work to get to know you?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_53,YOU!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_54,ARGHHH!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_55,You're EXTREMELY annoying!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_56,I'm going to KILL you!!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_57,I swear I'm going to burn you up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_58,You're the only one that could complete this assignment.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_59,At least among the people I know.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_60,...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_61,It has to be there...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_62,The only book that endured from the remnants of the fallen republic...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_63,The same coordinates that have been obsessively scrawled across all over the pages.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_64,Something feels off... as if it's desperately trying to point out something...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_65,Although I'm not sure what that may be.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_66,I get the sense that it will be anything but ordinary.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_67,It has to be there.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_68,It needs to be there.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_69,...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_70,So now you're pretending to be all serious?!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_71,Ah. I got carried away.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_72,I shall spare you the unnecessary details beyond this point. I wouldn't want to bore you.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_73,"Anyway, you're the right person for this job."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_74,"You're the only one. Second Lieutenant Pansirone, ex-Hound Unit."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_75,Second Lieutenant Pansirone! I order myself joining the Hound Unit!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_76,And I order me as the Head of the Unit!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_77,HA! Keep dreaming on your own.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_78,"And obviously, I'm the head!"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_79,"Huh, now that's something I haven't heard before."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_80,"Mister, who are these dumb-looking people?"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_81,What an exciting group!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_82,Are you seriously telling me I'm with these nut-jobs?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_83,"Hm, I haven't said much."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_84,I could burn you all up nice and crispy.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_85,Shush. All of you.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_86,Six months since the start of the artifact excavation.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_87,...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_88,"Hah, whatever."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_89,I'm only doing this because of those stupid people who won't leave me alone.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_90,Are you still not done?!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_91,Hurry up already!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_92,AHHHHHH!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_93,...Eeeek!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_94,Huh..?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_95,Why won't my shovel go down any further?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_96,Huh??
E1_Pancironne_3_1_97,Have you found something??
E1_Pancironne_3_1_98,What is it??
E1_Pancironne_3_1_99,"I don't know, but my shovel keeps getting stuck."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_100,Could... Could it be..?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_101,The signal! Get the device!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_102,H-Hold still.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_103,...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_104,I'm not getting anything.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_105,Then what is...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_106,Huh..?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_107,Uh... Um....... Ah...
E1_Pancironne_3_1_108,Ahhh!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_109,Th-the earth is shaking!!!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_110,Earthquake!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_111,Huh?!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_112,At last?!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_113,It's heeeeeeeeere!!!!!!!!!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_114,Se-second Lieutenant! What are you doing?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_115,Come back!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_116,Wheeeee!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_117,?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_118,Huh?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_119,It's a rock.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_120,Pa-pardon?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_121,It's a rock.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_122,It's just a rock! A rock!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_123,Ugh... I don't see anything!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_124,I knew that book was a stupid lie!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_125,Argh! This is SO annoying!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_126,Useless!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_127,You fools!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_128,Burn! All of you!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_129,AHHHH!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_130,???!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_131,The si-signal!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_132,The signal rates are becoming incredibly high!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_133,Ahh! It's broken!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_134,"Mine, too!"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_135,What the..!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_136,Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_137,Hmm?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_138,Woohoo! Look how tall they are!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_139,*Beep* Warning. Warning.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_140,"Sensing unidentifiable, extreme heat."
E1_Pancironne_3_1_141,Exceeding acceptable maximum value.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_142,Stealth mode damaged.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_143,Attempting recovery.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_144,Whoa! Cool!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_145,The rock is talking!
E1_Pancironne_3_1_146,...Recovery failed.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_147,Data permanently damaged due to extreme heat.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_148,Unable to activate Stealth mode.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_149,Enter admin registration code.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_150,Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
E1_Pancironne_3_1_151,"Hehe, I'm just going to burn it up!"
E1_Pancironne_3_1_152,Incorrect code. Incorrect code.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_153,Activating security system.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_154,Target locked.
E1_Pancironne_3_1_155,Attack.
E1_Pancironne_3_2_1,"Hee... If you pick a fight like that, you're gonna get me too excited!"
E1_Pancironne_3_3_1,Security system partially damaged.
E1_Pancironne_3_3_2,Attempting recovery.
E1_Pancironne_3_3_3,Eeek! You guys are fun!
E1_Pancironne_3_3_4,"Eh, no burn?"
E1_Pancironne_3_3_5,How about if I do this? Or this?!
E1_Pancironne_3_4_1,Security system damaged.
E1_Pancironne_3_4_2,Attempting recovery.

E1_Pancironne_3_4_8,Huh?!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_1,What the?! Where did it all go?!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_2,I was just getting started! Darn.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_3,Se-second Lieutenant!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_4,What if we were to send in those rocks?
E1_Pancironne_3_5_5,I can't get anything on my signal device because it's broken...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_6,"But since they came out after we defeated a monster, they must be something important!"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_7,Yay! We did it!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_7_plus,Hurrah!!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_8,"Ugh, shut up!"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_9,Can't you see that I'm mad because the fun is gone?!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_10,Gahhhh! SO ANNOYING!!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_11,BURN!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_12,Second Lieutenant!! Please calm down!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_13,Ahhhhh! She's at it again!!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_14,Artifact Excavation Report
E1_Pancironne_3_5_15,- Earthquake occurred.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_16,"- Was playing with rocks, which suddenly melted"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_17,- Sending remaining stones that came out of those rocks
E1_Pancironne_3_5_18,- Nothing apart from that. Seriously nothing.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_19,- Hating this place
E1_Pancironne_3_5_20,- P.S.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_21,": Unfortunately, 30 soldiers are unable to work due to an unexpected accident"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_22,: All signal devices have been broken
E1_Pancironne_3_5_23,This is nonsense.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_24,"Nothing makes sense, and every report talks about the loss of manpower."
E1_Pancironne_3_5_25,Isn't the cause crystal clear?
E1_Pancironne_3_5_26,"If you compare it with the report from the person I have at the site,"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_27,it isn't like there's anything wrong in particular.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_28,"Since I wasn't there to see it, I wouldn't be able to specify on anything,"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_29,but it seems clear that they engaged in battle with something.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_30,And take a look at this.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_31,"After all that fuss, all she sent in are these petty stones."
E1_Pancironne_3_5_32,"They are definitely reacting to the signal devices, though."
E1_Pancironne_3_5_33,As if they're in resonance.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_34,We-well yes...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_35,I guess you could call that peculiar.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_36,"But they still look like stones to me, no matter how I look at them!"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_37,(They did endure her flames. And this situation...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_38,There's more to this than meets the eye.)
E1_Pancironne_3_5_39,!?
E1_Pancironne_3_5_40,"Look, each piece has a groove."
E1_Pancironne_3_5_41,...Just as I thought. These have been carved in intentionally.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_42,Sir?
E1_Pancironne_3_5_43,See here.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_44,I'm about to perform some magic.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_45,Huh?!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_46,Weren't they all individual stone pieces??
E1_Pancironne_3_5_47,Th-this...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_48,This looks like a map...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_49,(This symbol on the end here.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_50,It's clearly a pattern of the Republic of Gray.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_51,But this map could hardly be seen as the republic's territory.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_52,Then where could it be?)
E1_Pancironne_3_5_53,...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_54,...Could it be?
E1_Pancironne_3_5_55,...?!!
E1_Pancironne_3_5_56,Hahaha... Wow...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_57,"Right, of course."
E1_Pancironne_3_5_58,??
E1_Pancironne_3_5_59,This is what the book wanted to tell us.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_60,"Uh.. Vice Commander, I'm not sure I understand."
E1_Pancironne_3_5_61,I was right to choose her.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_62,"Since we've reaped more than what I could've imagined,"
E1_Pancironne_3_5_63,I'll let the issue concerning the loss of manpower pass.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_64,Tell the site to pull out.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_65,...
E1_Pancironne_3_5_66,I'm going to need to find out if there are any related clues from the Ruins at Gargoss.
E1_Pancironne_3_5_67,(The treasure left behind by the republic to continue their great work.)
E1_Pancironne_3_5_68,(This is it.)
E1_Pancironne_3_5_69,(It's a map to the Technomagic Kingdom.)
E1_Pancironne_3_5_70,(...I need them.)
E1_Pancironne_3_6_1,We're finally pulling out!
E1_Pancironne_3_6_2,"Ugh, I've had enough of this place."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_3,I never want to see her as my superior again!
E1_Pancironne_3_6_4,I doubt there's anyone here who doesn't have a burn on their buttocks.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_5,It really was an odd assignment.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_6,"I still think they look like trash, but thank goodness we at least discovered those stones!"
E1_Pancironne_3_6_7,I'm so glad to be going back...
E1_Pancironne_3_6_8,Huh.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_9,Idiots. I bet they don't know this came out of those rocks.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_10,"Tersia, you remember, right?"
E1_Pancironne_3_6_11,"Thanks to him, I know what this is. Heh."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_12,It's an ore that's used by laboratories.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_13,"Don't touch it, as it may explode."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_14,"Especially you, Pansirone."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_15,"Heh, there's no way I'm going to help those suckers so easily."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_16,"If I go back, they're sure to go back to racking their brains, figuring out when and how to take advantage of me."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_17,"If I were to throw this into the air right now,"
E1_Pancironne_3_6_18,And BOOM—shoot it—
E1_Pancironne_3_6_19,Do you think it would burn everything that's in here?
E1_Pancironne_3_6_20,Don't you think the fireworks would look lovely?
E1_Pancironne_3_6_21,What's that? You think I would burn as well?
E1_Pancironne_3_6_22,Hmm.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_23,Then I guess I'll just burn with everything else!
E1_Pancironne_3_6_24,Here I go!
E1_Pancironne_3_6_25,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
E1_Pancironne_3_6_26,"Old man, check this out! Ahaha."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_27,"Hmm, I guess a little firework was in the works."
E1_Pancironne_3_6_28,What if we were to shoot one up with him attached?
E1_Pancironne_3_6_29,Shut up!
E1_Pancironne_3_6_30,Heh. It would be so much more fun.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_31,Old man! Do we really have to go with him?
E1_Pancironne_3_6_32,Shush.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_33,Stop dawdling and join the group.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_34,...Ugh.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_35,Heh.
E1_Pancironne_3_6_36,I guess I could wait just a bit little longer.
