CONVERSATION_TU_144,"Let's have a look inside! Hope there are no demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_163,"Ha ha. That was really tough..."
CONVERSATION_TU_164,"Congratulations Kasel! You have passed the test."
CONVERSATION_TU_165,"You have won the battle against your corrupted self."
CONVERSATION_TU_166,"Thank you, Hillia."
CONVERSATION_TU_167,"But this is not the end."
CONVERSATION_TU_168,"You should have retrieved a Crystal of Darkness from your corrupted self."
CONVERSATION_TU_169,"You mean this thing?"
CONVERSATION_TU_170,"Yes. Take it to the Room of Purification to purify it. Then you can unleash your true powers with it."
CONVERSATION_TU_171,"Amazing. I feel like I'm bursting with energy!"
CONVERSATION_TU_172,"Well done. You have grown a lot by overcoming these ordeals."
CONVERSATION_TU_173,"Don't forget this lesson, and devote yourself to overcoming any hardships in the future."
CONVERSATION_TU_174,"Thank you, Hillia. I will keep it in mind."
CONVERSATION_238,"Wh... what you is?"
CONVERSATION_239,"And you why is so strong-ak?"
CONVERSATION_240,"Where's my brother?"
CONVERSATION_241,"Your brother? Why you ask me?"
CONVERSATION_242,"Calm down, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_243,"Relax."
CONVERSATION_244,"You'll only make bad choices."
CONVERSATION_245,"Whew... whew..."
CONVERSATION_246,"Anyway..."
CONVERSATION_247,"Are these all bombs?"
CONVERSATION_248,"Bombs. Me proud!"
CONVERSATION_249,"My captain praise-ak!"
CONVERSATION_250,"Me bomb tree!"
CONVERSATION_251,"Captain? Tree? You mean the World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_252,"Me say wrong!"
CONVERSATION_253,"Tarokki in trouble!"
CONVERSATION_254,"World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_255,"Boom, vibrations"
CONVERSATION_256,"Drat!"
CONVERSATION_257,"It's coming from the World Tree!"
CONVERSATION_258,"Kasel, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_259,"Wait!"
CONVERSATION_260,"Fools!"
CONVERSATION_261,"Sigh. Roi, take care of it and follow us!"
CONVERSATION_262,"Tarokki run!"
CONVERSATION_263,"He's gone... well, he shouldn't cause too much trouble."
CONVERSATION_264,"He's running with a burning bomb."
CONVERSATION_272,"Hang on. I'm coming to help!"
CONVERSATION_273,"Oh my! I don't remember inviting a kid knight."
CONVERSATION_274,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_286,"That's not happening..."
CONVERSATION_287,"I'm going to save my brother!"
CONVERSATION_290,"Oh no..."
CONVERSATION_291,"Drat! Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_292,"Get off me, demon!"
CONVERSATION_293,"I can't let you do that!"
CONVERSATION_294,"Let's fight fair!"
CONVERSATION_295,"Ha ha ha."
CONVERSATION_306,"Now, prepare to die."
CONVERSATION_307,"Damn, is this it?"
CONVERSATION_308,"I couldn't even rescue my brother."
CONVERSATION_309,"Frey,"
CONVERSATION_310,"Miss Cleo,"
CONVERSATION_311,"Roi..."
CONVERSATION_312,"Are we all going to die here?"
CONVERSATION_313,"I should've been more careful."
CONVERSATION_314,"But... I made it this far"
CONVERSATION_315,"with everyone's help..."
CONVERSATION_316,"I can't just give up like this."
CONVERSATION_317,"Frey,"
CONVERSATION_318,"Clause,"
CONVERSATION_319,"Miss Cleo,"
CONVERSATION_320,"Roi... I can't just leave them."
CONVERSATION_321,"I won't be an embarrassment to my brother!"
CONVERSATION_322,"I can't die like this. I've got to save my brother and Frey!"
CONVERSATION_323,"Arrrrrrrrrrgh!"
CONVERSATION_324,"Casts Skill No. 3"
CONVERSATION_325,"This is...!"
CONVERSATION_326,"I'll keep them safe."
CONVERSATION_327,"Clause, Frey,"
CONVERSATION_328,"Cleo, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_329,"I'll keep them safe!"
CONVERSATION_330,"Here I come, witch!"
CONVERSATION_343,"But you just wait and see. I will take your sword one day."
CONVERSATION_346,"What?"
CONVERSATION_348,"Argh... wait!"
CONVERSATION_349,"How does the demon know about my mother...?"
CONVERSATION_1453,"Ew, something is rotting."
CONVERSATION_1454,"It's the worse than anything I experienced before..."
CONVERSATION_1455,"Well, I smell something. Doesn't smell like magic."
CONVERSATION_1456,"We are talking about corrupted magic."
CONVERSATION_1457,"Well, there is that smell too."
CONVERSATION_1458,"There used to be principalities in this region."
CONVERSATION_1459,"Then it turned into a battlefield against the Dar Lord."
CONVERSATION_1460,"When that battle was won, humanity was able to turn the tide in their favor."
CONVERSATION_1461,"But the whole region was completely ruined."
CONVERSATION_1462,"The Undead are still common here."
CONVERSATION_1463,"This means we may be held up here."
CONVERSATION_1464,"You don't get to kill them. They only keep coming at you."
CONVERSATION_1465,"We need to pass through them and make it quick."
CONVERSATION_1466,"Don't worry. I'm not stupid!"
CONVERSATION_1467,"We will find Phillop and get out of here."
CONVERSATION_1468,"This must be how the dark plague looks like."
CONVERSATION_1469,"I can almost feel the pain from the look."
CONVERSATION_1470,"While humans are immune, it's deadly to animals."
CONVERSATION_1471,"The pain drives them mad and makes them attack everything around."
CONVERSATION_1472,"What about a cure?"
CONVERSATION_1473,"Nothing concrete yet."
CONVERSATION_1474,"We are still working on it. No treatment for now."
CONVERSATION_1475,"I guess that's how it is. Let's make it quick!"
CONVERSATION_1476,"Wow, that was rough."
CONVERSATION_1477,"It was destroying itself. Too much to take in..."
CONVERSATION_1478,"Poor thing."
CONVERSATION_1479,"Studies suggest nothing can stay sane in that pain."
CONVERSATION_1480,"It'd be a mercy to end the misery."
CONVERSATION_1481,"Yeah. A mercy."
CONVERSATION_1482,"It's just too sad."
CONVERSATION_1483,"Hey, look. The Undead."
CONVERSATION_1484,"They were once proud warriors."
CONVERSATION_1485,"Now all but the urge to fight is lost."
CONVERSATION_1486,"The knighthood used to send out help to keep them under control."
CONVERSATION_1487,"Looks like that's not the case anymore."
CONVERSATION_1488,"Yeah."
CONVERSATION_1489,"With the World Tree under attack, this would be the last place anyone would care."
CONVERSATION_1490,"It's not exactly a pleasant view."
CONVERSATION_1491,"Having read about them doesn't help me, either."
CONVERSATION_1492,"OK. Let's get it over with. Fast."
CONVERSATION_1493,"Be careful, Clause."
CONVERSATION_1494,"You watch out. It won't be easy."
CONVERSATION_1495,"Whew, that was close."
CONVERSATION_1496,"They were tougher than we heard."
CONVERSATION_1497,"I think this place is overwhelmed by Dark Legion."
CONVERSATION_1498,"Maybe we should look if there is the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_1499,"We don't know that. I don't like leaving this as it is,"
CONVERSATION_1500,"but let's focus on finding Phillop first."
CONVERSATION_1501,"We shouldn't be dragging our feet."
CONVERSATION_1502,"Kasel, you can't be serious."
CONVERSATION_1503,"We would be the only people who can destroy the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_1504,"It is our duty as knights!"
CONVERSATION_1505,"We can't be sidetracked anymore."
CONVERSATION_1506,"Helping Naila and Kaulah was enough."
CONVERSATION_1507,"Shouldn't waste time on something we aren't even sure of!"
CONVERSATION_1508,"Stop it, both of you."
CONVERSATION_1509,"We can keep an eye out for the Nucleus of Darkness while looking for Phillop."
CONVERSATION_1510,"There is no reason to argue while we can do both."
CONVERSATION_1511,"Right. We can deal with the Nucleus of Darkness when we know there is one."
CONVERSATION_1512,"Fair enough."
CONVERSATION_1513,"Kasel has a point."
CONVERSATION_1514,"Move out, then!"
CONVERSATION_1515,"I hope all goes well..."
CONVERSATION_1516,"Yuck, the stench!"
CONVERSATION_1517,"It's rotten magic radiating from the Nucleus of Darkness, without a doubt!"
CONVERSATION_1518,"It was the Nucleus of Darkness after all!"
CONVERSATION_1519,"Fine. Now we can destroy it and move on."
CONVERSATION_1520,"Wait. This might be a trap."
CONVERSATION_1521,"What then, we can't just sit here."
CONVERSATION_1522,"We are running out of time."
CONVERSATION_1523,"Trap or not, I'd rather walk in and figure it out then!"
CONVERSATION_1524,"Kasel, no!"
CONVERSATION_1525,"Drat, Cleo! Close your eyes!"
CONVERSATION_1526,"It's fine, as long as it's not the full darkness!"
CONVERSATION_1527,"Frey! Kasel! Clause!"
CONVERSATION_1528,"I'm here!"
CONVERSATION_1529,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_1530,"I'm okay, too. Stay together!"
CONVERSATION_1531,"Haha, got the holy sword and you're suddenly a man."
CONVERSATION_1532,"You ran when your little sister was being taken by the demons,"
CONVERSATION_1533,"how funny to see you act like a hero with that holy sword."
CONVERSATION_1534,"Funny indeed."
CONVERSATION_1535,"Drat... who is this?"
CONVERSATION_1536,"So, you saved a few. Does that make you a hero?"
CONVERSATION_1537,"I don't think so. You still stink of guilt."
CONVERSATION_1538,"You were the only survivor there."
CONVERSATION_1539,"You live because you ran. How dare you play a hero."
CONVERSATION_1540,"Pitiful. Shameful."
CONVERSATION_1541,"Enough! Show yourself! Come out and face me!"
CONVERSATION_1542,"Calm down, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_1543,"It's the dark whispering, don't listen to it!"
CONVERSATION_1544,"Ahh... dear Clause."
CONVERSATION_1545,"The conscience of the Royal Knights of Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_1546,"This is the Clause who kept silent and let the dirty knights go."
CONVERSATION_1547,"How exemplary!"
CONVERSATION_1548,"Yeah..."
CONVERSATION_1549,"This is a proud knight of justice who lights the darkness?"
CONVERSATION_1550,"You turned your back on the dark and injustice!"
CONVERSATION_1551,"Yet you wander everywhere, bragging about your knighthood."
CONVERSATION_1552,"Oh, so noble of you."
CONVERSATION_1553,"Keep it together!"
CONVERSATION_1554,"This is a trick."
CONVERSATION_1555,"Don't let it get to you!"
CONVERSATION_1556,"Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_1557,"The sorceress from the Tower of the Sage, the flame master!"
CONVERSATION_1558,"Your mother didn't want you,"
CONVERSATION_1559,"your colleagues hated you."
CONVERSATION_1560,"You ditched the only friend because you're too afraid!"
CONVERSATION_1561,"Stupid! That's not true!"
CONVERSATION_1562,"Oh, yeah?"
CONVERSATION_1563,"Is it not true that you still dream of your mama leaving?"
CONVERSATION_1564,"Do your legs not shudder when you look upon dark places?"
CONVERSATION_1565,"Still not true, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_1566,"Just block your ears, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_1567,"Don't listen to it!"
CONVERSATION_1568,"There you are, Roi."
CONVERSATION_1569,"Swift Roi, people call you, right?"
CONVERSATION_1570,"I thought you kill anyone for money."
CONVERSATION_1571,"I didn't know Swift Roi was into heroism."
CONVERSATION_1572,"Does that make you different now?"
CONVERSATION_1573,"As if that would wash away the bloodstains on your hands?"
CONVERSATION_1574,"Who are you kidding, Roi?"
CONVERSATION_1575,"You are an assassin - you feed on killing!"
CONVERSATION_1576,"Everyone, pull yourself together!"
CONVERSATION_1577,"Frey, I see such darkness in you."
CONVERSATION_1578,"It's amusing to see it in a priest."
CONVERSATION_1579,"Are you sure you serve the Goddess Lua?"
CONVERSATION_1580,"You'd do better serving Lea, the goddess of darkness!"
CONVERSATION_1581,"Quiet, demon!"
CONVERSATION_1582,"Be gone!"
CONVERSATION_1583,"Hello! Somebody called a demon?"
CONVERSATION_1584,"What!"
CONVERSATION_1585,"How... how is it possible?"
CONVERSATION_1586,"I created this place out of their own consciousness."
CONVERSATION_1587,"You are not supposed to be in it!"
CONVERSATION_1588,"Duh. I'm a succubus and the dream world is my domain."
CONVERSATION_1589,"Are demons that desperate to let you be in charge?"
CONVERSATION_1590,"Whatever, this is fun."
CONVERSATION_1591,"Let's play!"
CONVERSATION_1592,"Whew!"
CONVERSATION_1593,"That was some good workout!"
CONVERSATION_1594,"Did a demon help us just now? What's going on?"
CONVERSATION_1595,"What do you want?"
CONVERSATION_1596,"Why would I help you?"
CONVERSATION_1597,"Well, it looked fun!"
CONVERSATION_1598,"Fun?"
CONVERSATION_1599,"Yeah, fun!"
CONVERSATION_1600,"You see, us demons live so long."
CONVERSATION_1601,"At a certain point, nothing is fun anymore."
CONVERSATION_1602,"So, I go look around for fun things."
CONVERSATION_1603,"And here, I smelled something fun, so I came to check!"
CONVERSATION_1604,"She must be Epis, the Entertainer."
CONVERSATION_1605,"You mean that Epis from the war?"
CONVERSATION_1606,"Huh? You know about me?"
CONVERSATION_1607,"This is interesting."
CONVERSATION_1608,"That was 100 years ago."
CONVERSATION_1609,"That's an awful long time for humans."
CONVERSATION_1610,"It's been 100 years, indeed, but we haven't forgotten any of you."
CONVERSATION_1611,"I'm honored. My name is Kasel."
CONVERSATION_1612,"Aha. So, you're the one the sword chose this time."
CONVERSATION_1613,"Yes, I'm the one."
CONVERSATION_1614,"You do look very interesting."
CONVERSATION_1615,"Well, good luck!"
CONVERSATION_1616,"Have to go. I smell something fun."
CONVERSATION_1617,"So long!"
CONVERSATION_1618,"Wait, please!"
CONVERSATION_1619,"Is this how demons are?"
CONVERSATION_1620,"I wouldn't know the answer for that."
CONVERSATION_1621,"She seemed nice, though."
CONVERSATION_1622,"Shush, the Undead ahead."
CONVERSATION_1623,"Huh? I hear a voice."
CONVERSATION_1624,"Yaaaah!"
CONVERSATION_1625,"Someone's there!"
CONVERSATION_1626,"We should help!"
CONVERSATION_1627,"Helping was unnecessary, but thanks anyways!"
CONVERSATION_1628,"It's our sworn duty as knights."
CONVERSATION_1629,"I'm Clause, one of the Knights of Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_1630,"Same here. I'm Kasel."
CONVERSATION_1631,"You've come all this way from Orvelia?"
CONVERSATION_1632,"This is a rough land to be in."
CONVERSATION_1633,"Call me Phillop."
CONVERSATION_1634,"You are Phillop!"
CONVERSATION_1635,"Do you know anything about Hallinkeh the fire dragon?"
CONVERSATION_1636,"A young lady with passion!"
CONVERSATION_1637,"I'm sorry. I am a dragon hunter, but I don't know anything about Hallinkeh."
CONVERSATION_1638,"That thing was gone long before I was even born."
CONVERSATION_1639,"Oh, I see..."
CONVERSATION_1640,"That's an ancient story. Why the curiosity?"
CONVERSATION_1641,"Forgive my manners. I'm Cleo. I'm the fire sorceress from the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_1642,"I've been looking for some Clause on flame magic..."
CONVERSATION_1643,"I see, I see."
CONVERSATION_1644,"I don't know Hallinkeh the dragon,"
CONVERSATION_1645,"but I do know Hallinkeh the witch."
CONVERSATION_1646,"You know the witch?"
CONVERSATION_1647,"I owe her favor from a while back."
CONVERSATION_1648,"Do you remember when?"
CONVERSATION_1649,"That was three years ago or so."
CONVERSATION_1650,"Three years!"
CONVERSATION_1651,"She may still be alive somewhere!"
CONVERSATION_1652,"That's relief."
CONVERSATION_1653,"I have to say, you make a curious group."
CONVERSATION_1654,"A priest, two knights, a wizard, and an assassin."
CONVERSATION_1655,"All of you, here in Galluah Plains."
CONVERSATION_1656,"Can I ask why?"
CONVERSATION_1657,"Kasel, show him."
CONVERSATION_1658,"Do you recognize this sword?"
CONVERSATION_1659,"The holy sword!"
CONVERSATION_1660,"Interesting. I hate it when my gut proves right."
CONVERSATION_1661,"I sensed something serious that sent me to regroup my old friends."
CONVERSATION_1662,"And the first thing I see is the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_1663,"I can tell the seals of the Orcs and Elves are lifted."
CONVERSATION_1664,"Aren't they?"
CONVERSATION_1665,"Yes."
CONVERSATION_1666,"So, the holy sword is back. That means the world is in danger."
CONVERSATION_1667,"The hunch was real, after all."
CONVERSATION_1668,"Dwarves were also the part of sealing the sword."
CONVERSATION_1669,"I'm afraid there is nothing I can do to help you with this here."
CONVERSATION_1670,"I need a powerful smelter and it's in the volcanic region of La Dragia."
CONVERSATION_1671,"The place is empty now, however. Everyone fled from the attack."
CONVERSATION_1672,"You mean the Dwarven kingdom is no longer there?"
CONVERSATION_1673,"Sadly so."
CONVERSATION_1674,"Those demons were beyond us. There was no choice."
CONVERSATION_1675,"The warriors of Windland have offered to help, so that's something."
CONVERSATION_1676,"My quest is to get whoever is behind it."
CONVERSATION_1677,"There are only few who can control that kind of army."
CONVERSATION_1678,"That's why I'm looking for other hunters that are still alive."
CONVERSATION_1679,"We are not all that useless. Not yet, Haha!"
CONVERSATION_1680,"We could use your help as well if you can."
CONVERSATION_1681,"Well, why not."
CONVERSATION_1682,"My gut tells me you will lead me to my target."
CONVERSATION_1683,"Let's find out."
CONVERSATION_1684,"I see a huge one ahead."
CONVERSATION_1685,"Looks like a skeleton..."
CONVERSATION_1686,"Kellsticks the Watchman!"
CONVERSATION_1687,"He still lives!"
CONVERSATION_1688,"OK. Let's think it over first. We will plan..."
CONVERSATION_1689,"Kellsticks!!!"
CONVERSATION_1690,"Kasel, what are you doing?"
CONVERSATION_1691,"Huh? I heard you, barking mongrel."
CONVERSATION_1692,"Where are you?"
CONVERSATION_1693,"You will know when I shatter your skull!"
CONVERSATION_1694,"I will end you!"
CONVERSATION_1695,"Hahaha. I thought you were going to shatter my skull."
CONVERSATION_1696,"What are you still doing with my minions, then?"
CONVERSATION_1697,"You can't touch me!"
CONVERSATION_1698,"I'm just starting!"
CONVERSATION_1699,"Argh...!"
CONVERSATION_1700,"Don't stand there, duck!"
CONVERSATION_1701,"Oh no..."
CONVERSATION_1702,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_1703,"Roi, get over there!"
CONVERSATION_1704,"I will cover you!"
CONVERSATION_1705,"Kasel, pull it together and keep going!"
CONVERSATION_1706,"Ouch..."
CONVERSATION_1707,"Clause, the wound is too deep."
CONVERSATION_1708,"I can help, but you shouldn't move for a while."
CONVERSATION_1709,"I can fight."
CONVERSATION_1710,"I said you shouldn't!"
CONVERSATION_1711,"Frey, listen to me."
CONVERSATION_1712,"Kasel was right."
CONVERSATION_1713,"We need to act and do it quick, or it will be Elidora and Ogria all over again."
CONVERSATION_1714,"I'm fine, really. I'm not just a knight by name."
CONVERSATION_1715,"Don't do something stupid."
CONVERSATION_1716,"Don't worry."
CONVERSATION_1717,"Let's go help Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_1718,"No! You little..."
CONVERSATION_1719,"Die, Kellsticks!"
CONVERSATION_1720,"This is for my village!"
CONVERSATION_1721,"This is for my parents!"
CONVERSATION_1722,"And this is for Karen!"
CONVERSATION_1723,"Ha...haha..."
CONVERSATION_1724,"Look at you, the sword bearer."
CONVERSATION_1725,"You are a shell, blind in vengeance."
CONVERSATION_1726,"Master will be pleased to see you!"
CONVERSATION_1727,"Hahahaha..."
CONVERSATION_1728,"Whew... whew..."
CONVERSATION_1729,"I avenged them..."
CONVERSATION_1730,"Are you okay, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_1731,"Are you all right?"
CONVERSATION_1732,"I'm fine."
CONVERSATION_1733,"My village... it's all done."
CONVERSATION_1734,"Well done. May their souls rest in peace now."
CONVERSATION_1735,"Your parents. Karen, too."
CONVERSATION_1736,"When this is all over, let's go back and share the story."
CONVERSATION_1737,"And get drunk."
CONVERSATION_1738,"Don't try too hard."
CONVERSATION_1739,"Haha, who cares anymore!"
CONVERSATION_1740,"Right. Let's do that, when it's all over!"
CONVERSATION_1741,"Yes!"
CONVERSATION_1742,"I smell the rotten magic nearby."
CONVERSATION_1743,"I'm so sick of this smell already..."
CONVERSATION_1744,"It's worse than what we normally get."
CONVERSATION_1745,"Even I can vaguely feel it."
CONVERSATION_1746,"This is something sinister... and powerful."
CONVERSATION_1747,"Foolish humans again."
CONVERSATION_1748,"It's the one from Elidora!"
CONVERSATION_1749,"Watch out, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_1750,"You don't know what he's up to!"
CONVERSATION_1751,"Frey, stay close!"
CONVERSATION_1752,"Yes!"
CONVERSATION_1753,"I have to admit, I'm impressed."
CONVERSATION_1754,"I didn't expect you to make it here."
CONVERSATION_1755,"Thought either the trap or Kellsticks would finish you."
CONVERSATION_1756,"I knew it! The trap was your plan!"
CONVERSATION_1757,"Coward!"
CONVERSATION_1758,"Hey, you walked right into them."
CONVERSATION_1759,"I didn't think it would be that easy."
CONVERSATION_1760,"What do you want from us?"
CONVERSATION_1761,"I learned the sword bearer's rage is"
CONVERSATION_1762,"what triggers the true power of it."
CONVERSATION_1763,"You are very talented at it, boy."
CONVERSATION_1764,"With that power, you can aide in His return."
CONVERSATION_1765,"Him? Are you talking about the Dark Lord?"
CONVERSATION_1766,"Nice to see you still alive, Phillop."
CONVERSATION_1767,"Didn't expect to you see you here."
CONVERSATION_1768,"Yes. Master is returning."
CONVERSATION_1769,"And it won't be the same as 100 years ago."
CONVERSATION_1770,"That's impossible! The power of the holy sword sealed him away!"
CONVERSATION_1771,"Sealed away? With the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_1772,"Do you know what happened to your hero Kyle, after he did that?"
CONVERSATION_1773,"That sword is not that holy after all."
CONVERSATION_1774,"Enough with the banal chats."
CONVERSATION_1775,"Let's see what that powerful sword can do."
CONVERSATION_1776,"Will you little curs be worthy enough to play the part in His plan?"
CONVERSATION_1777,"Haha. Not bad!"
CONVERSATION_1778,"I don't think this is a match to His might."
CONVERSATION_1779,"Step up, bearer. You'd better make the full use of that sword now."
CONVERSATION_1780,"Or you shall die!"
CONVERSATION_1781,"Be careful, everyone!"
CONVERSATION_1782,"This is way too powerful for me to block!"
CONVERSATION_1783,"Damn, there is no way to survive that type of hit!"
CONVERSATION_1784,"This can't be! Magic like that was rare even 100 years ago!"
CONVERSATION_1785,"Stay together everyone!"
CONVERSATION_1786,"I will try my best to shield us!"
CONVERSATION_1787,"No, that won't do help!"
CONVERSATION_1788,"His shield will crush us, just look at it!"
CONVERSATION_1789,"Drat! The sword must be the only way."
CONVERSATION_1790,"It should be me!"
CONVERSATION_1791,"What are you doing, silly!"
CONVERSATION_1792,"The Knights of Orvelia know no defeat!"
CONVERSATION_1793,"Forged with light are our swords and shields,"
CONVERSATION_1794,"and we shall keep darkness at bay!"
CONVERSATION_1795,"Madness!"
CONVERSATION_1796,"Don't you see my shield at all?"
CONVERSATION_1797,"I will crush you!"
CONVERSATION_1798,"Argh!"
CONVERSATION_1799,"It broke the shield!"
CONVERSATION_1800,"Clause, Clause!"
CONVERSATION_1801,"What are you waiting for!"
CONVERSATION_1802,"Jump in!"
CONVERSATION_1803,"Little worms... I may have underestimated you."
CONVERSATION_1804,"It's too late to stop the Nucleus of Darkness now. Stopping my spell won't change anything."
CONVERSATION_1805,"The Nucleus of Darkness will explode soon."
CONVERSATION_1806,"Hahahaha!"
CONVERSATION_1807,"No!"
CONVERSATION_1808,"Frey, stay with me!"
CONVERSATION_1809,"We have to do what we can to stop it!"
CONVERSATION_1810,"Yes, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_1811,"We won't go down that easy!"
CONVERSATION_1812,"That's right! That'd be a shame!"
CONVERSATION_1813,"What!"
CONVERSATION_1814,"Aaah!"
CONVERSATION_1815,"Still a bully, Malduk!"
CONVERSATION_1816,"Epis! Betrayer! How are you still alive!"
CONVERSATION_1817,"I'm so sick of you!"
CONVERSATION_1818,"Oh, that makes two of us!"
CONVERSATION_1819,"You are a boring man!"
CONVERSATION_1820,"Let's see how long it takes you to change your mind."
CONVERSATION_1821,"You will wish you were dead when Master returns."
CONVERSATION_1822,"Haha, try to break off that one!"
CONVERSATION_1823,"Hey! Running away again?"
CONVERSATION_1824,"Of course, what did I expect from bony idiots!"
CONVERSATION_1825,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_1826,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_1827,"What's going on?"
CONVERSATION_1828,"......a tragedy."
CONVERSATION_1829,"A tragedy?"
CONVERSATION_1830,"No, Clause! Stay with us!"
CONVERSATION_1831,"The wound is too deep. Treating it won't buy us enough time!"
CONVERSATION_1832,"I will do it anyways!"
CONVERSATION_1833,"Awk... Kasel..."
CONVERSATION_1834,"Clause, can you see me?"
CONVERSATION_1835,"I'm sorry. The drink will.. have to wait..."
CONVERSATION_1836,"Stop it! Don't say it!"
CONVERSATION_1837,"Clause? Clause?"
CONVERSATION_1838,"No, no, no... No, Clause..."
CONVERSATION_1839,"Look at me! Say something!"
CONVERSATION_1840,"Come on! Clause..."
CONVERSATION_1841,"No..."
CONVERSATION_1842,"This is not why you became the knight."
CONVERSATION_1843,"So many people are waiting for your help."
CONVERSATION_1844,"You can't stop here."
CONVERSATION_1845,"What can I do without you... we can't..."
CONVERSATION_1846,"Please wake up!"
CONVERSATION_1847,"Please..."
CONVERSATION_1848,"I guess I was little too late."
CONVERSATION_1849,"It's already done. Don't be too hard on yourself."
CONVERSATION_1850,"I don't. I'm a demon."
CONVERSATION_1851,"You look old, by the way."
CONVERSATION_1852,"Unlike somebody, I age."
CONVERSATION_1853,"Maybe we are both late."
CONVERSATION_1854,"Kyle and Maria... We couldn't save them, either."
CONVERSATION_1855,"I didn't know cared that much. You didn't show up."
CONVERSATION_1856,"Hey, I may be a demon but I do care about friends."
CONVERSATION_1857,"I know."
CONVERSATION_1858,"That's why you are here now."
CONVERSATION_1859,"Yes."
CONVERSATION_1860,"In Lua, in her teaching,"
CONVERSATION_1861,"Lived a man who guarded the justice and stood up for the weak."
CONVERSATION_1862,"Sir Clause ends his duty here today."
CONVERSATION_1863,"Let his soul returns to your arms,"
CONVERSATION_1864,"may he rest in eternal peace now."
CONVERSATION_1865,"This was none of your fault."
CONVERSATION_1866,"He was a great knight."
CONVERSATION_1867,"As honorable as any of knights who sacrificed their life here 100 years ago."
CONVERSATION_1868,"You can leave this place in my care."
CONVERSATION_1869,"Thank you."
CONVERSATION_1870,"Malduk made a mess with his last spell."
CONVERSATION_1871,"Cleaning up will be quite a deal."
CONVERSATION_1872,"Don't worry. Epis and I can still deal with that much."
CONVERSATION_1873,"Once I'm done here, I will head to Windland to look for Lorraine."
CONVERSATION_1874,"I will see you there."
CONVERSATION_1875,"Which way to Arrovina?"
CONVERSATION_1876,"Take the path down."
CONVERSATION_1877,"Heading to Arrovina?"
CONVERSATION_1878,"Watch out as you get there."
CONVERSATION_1879,"They were never hostile people,"
CONVERSATION_1880,"but lately they've been attacking anyone passing by."
CONVERSATION_1881,"Thank you."
CONVERSATION_1882,"Farewell, Phillop."
CONVERSATION_1883,"Hope to see you again."
CONVERSATION_1884,"Farewell, little lady."
CONVERSATION_1885,"Let's go, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_1886,"Clause didn't die in vain, we should continue."
CONVERSATION_1887,"You're right. We should get moving."
CONVERSATION_1888,"We don’t know what else they are planning to do."
CONVERSATION_1889,"We will find them all and stop them."
CONVERSATION_1890,"Hey, you should check your priority."
CONVERSATION_1891,"Weren’t releasing the holy sword your task?"
CONVERSATION_1892,"After all, we are doing it to defeat the demons once and for good."
CONVERSATION_1893,"There must be another Nucleus of Darkness for we all know."
CONVERSATION_1894,"We must find and destroy them... to stop this from happening again."
CONVERSATION_1895,"I thought this could happen."
CONVERSATION_1896,"I'm worried about you."
CONVERSATION_1897,"Remember what Phillop said. It's not your fault."
CONVERSATION_1898,"Clause will be wracked with guilt if you end up dying."
CONVERSATION_1899,"I understand."
CONVERSATION_1900,"......."
CONVERSATION_1901,"......."
CONVERSATION_1902,"We will be in Arrovina soon."
CONVERSATION_1903,"Land of Arrows. As it suggests, it's territory of the dark Elves."
CONVERSATION_1904,"Don't get it wrong, dark elves have nothing to do with the darkness."
CONVERSATION_1905,"It only refers to their skin color and the soil color in this region."
CONVERSATION_1906,"......."
CONVERSATION_1907,"I see..."
CONVERSATION_1908,"This is going nowhere."
CONVERSATION_1909,"Listen, I feel for you but you can't do this forever."
CONVERSATION_1910,"I know nothing I can say will make you feel better, too."
CONVERSATION_1911,"It's rough."
CONVERSATION_1912,"Maybe time is what you need."
CONVERSATION_1913,"It worked for me."
CONVERSATION_1914,"Price of living in the dark age."
CONVERSATION_1915,"I see gnolls ahead."
CONVERSATION_1916,"You mean the stupid gnolls?"
CONVERSATION_1917,"Don't let their clumsy moves fool you."
CONVERSATION_1918,"They are beasts. Never underestimate them."
CONVERSATION_1919,"I'd rather find a way around."
CONVERSATION_1920,"Hey!"
CONVERSATION_1921,"Roi, is that a person standing beyond the gnolls?"
CONVERSATION_1922,"Let's go."
CONVERSATION_1923,"Right with you."
CONVERSATION_1924,"Wow, wait!"
CONVERSATION_1925,"It's like there are 3 Rois!"
CONVERSATION_1926,"Come on, I'm not that bad!"
CONVERSATION_1927,"Anyways, let's hurry. It looks dangerous!"
CONVERSATION_1928,"Krawr! Krawr!"
CONVERSATION_1929,"Good, they are running."
CONVERSATION_1930,"They probably have never saw real fire like mine!"
CONVERSATION_1931,"Are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_1932,"You look hurt, let me you help."
CONVERSATION_1933,"it. Now humans, too?"
CONVERSATION_1934,"Crazy times."
CONVERSATION_1935,"Look out, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_1936,"Ouch!"
CONVERSATION_1937,"Are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_1938,"Yeah, it's just a scratch."
CONVERSATION_1939,"I guess we have to use force now."
CONVERSATION_1940,"We know nothing about this area."
CONVERSATION_1941,"We can use a guide."
CONVERSATION_1942,"Damn!"
CONVERSATION_1943,"Stop trying or I will make you."
CONVERSATION_1944,"Maybe I should start with that point ears of yours."
CONVERSATION_1945,"Another totem puppet, is it?"
CONVERSATION_1946,"Totem?"
CONVERSATION_1947,"It's an object that releases dark magic."
CONVERSATION_1948,"The elf just said puppets, looks like there is"
CONVERSATION_1949,"a mind-controlling one nearby."
CONVERSATION_1950,"Well, maybe not puppets, after all. You must be clean."
CONVERSATION_1951,"You can lower your weapons now. I have no reason to attack you now."
CONVERSATION_1952,"I thought you were controlled by the totem. Sorry about that."
CONVERSATION_1953,"He's too quick to change his attitude, I don't like it."
CONVERSATION_1954,"Don't trust him, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_1955,"We can at least ask if he's willing to cooperate."
CONVERSATION_1956,"Take us to the road to Windland and we will let you live."
CONVERSATION_1957,"How rude."
CONVERSATION_1958,"Well, I guess I owe you that much."
CONVERSATION_1959,"I'm Dimael Barka from the 44th Hunter Division of the Arrovina Royal Army."
CONVERSATION_1960,"I'm Kasel, a Royal Knight of Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_1961,"That should be enough for you."
CONVERSATION_1962,"I'm heading to Windland on a royal mission."
CONVERSATION_1963,"You must be in hurry."
CONVERSATION_1964,"Sorry to disappoint you but north is where our fortress is."
CONVERSATION_1965,"We need to take the southern path."
CONVERSATION_1966,"Why south?"
CONVERSATION_1967,"Something is seriously wrong. The queen is out of control."
CONVERSATION_1968,"I've returned from a mission to Aegina Desert."
CONVERSATION_1969,"Then I saw the entire country went mad. They are on a killing spree."
CONVERSATION_1970,"They wouldn't care you're from Orvelia or what, they will kill you."
CONVERSATION_1971,"How come you didn't turn?"
CONVERSATION_1972,"I was in Aegina for quite a while, probably that's why."
CONVERSATION_1973,"This spell turned everyone in the entire Arrovina."
CONVERSATION_1974,"That needs some time to work."
CONVERSATION_1975,"He has a point."
CONVERSATION_1976,"Mind-control is magic that needs to develop."
CONVERSATION_1977,"It'd be harder to get when targets are resistant to magic like Elves."
CONVERSATION_1978,"That doesn't suddenly make him trustworthy."
CONVERSATION_1979,"Kasel, let him lead the way."
CONVERSATION_1980,"That'd be better."
CONVERSATION_1981,"Curious."
CONVERSATION_1982,"Priests don't wear that look you have. Something has happened to you."
CONVERSATION_1983,"Whatever. I'll do as you say."
CONVERSATION_1984,"This way."
CONVERSATION_1985,"Why are there so many beasts here?"
CONVERSATION_1986,"You'd better not be playing us."
CONVERSATION_1987,"Contrary to popular belief, soldiers value their own life."
CONVERSATION_1988,"Well, not so much when he failed to protect his own family..."
CONVERSATION_1989,"Normally it's our job to patrol this area."
CONVERSATION_1990,"Only now hunters are all mad and focusing on something else."
CONVERSATION_1991,"That's why there are so many of them."
CONVERSATION_1992,"Too many. We are surrounded."
CONVERSATION_1993,"I can sense them moving."
CONVERSATION_1994,"Indeed."
CONVERSATION_1995,"And the gnolls are attacking us."
CONVERSATION_1996,"Prepare to engage!"
CONVERSATION_1997,"You're not the boss of me!"
CONVERSATION_1998,"Kraaawr!"
CONVERSATION_1999,"Revenge!"
CONVERSATION_2000,"Kyak!"
CONVERSATION_2001,"Retreat!"
CONVERSATION_2002,"Back to the boss!"
CONVERSATION_2003,"Looks like they have a boss."
CONVERSATION_2004,"They sure do."
CONVERSATION_2005,"We almost got it a few times, but this one is smart."
CONVERSATION_2006,"It must be that one leading those gnolls."
CONVERSATION_2007,"Let's check, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2008,"This might be the dark magic again."
CONVERSATION_2009,"Wait, I don't think they smelled it."
CONVERSATION_2010,"They did."
CONVERSATION_2011,"F-Frey?"
CONVERSATION_2012,"They did."
CONVERSATION_2013,"We have no choice, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_2014,"Let's get it over with quickly."
CONVERSATION_2015,"Okay..."
CONVERSATION_2016,"I smell gnolls."
CONVERSATION_2017,"I smell the scent of a boss one I told you about."
CONVERSATION_2018,"Are all Dark Elves good at this?"
CONVERSATION_2019,"No, just the experienced trackers."
CONVERSATION_2020,"We are lucky. There are no other trackers for this one."
CONVERSATION_2021,"We are free to hunt."
CONVERSATION_2022,"Fine. I will take the lead."
CONVERSATION_2023,"Frey, watch our back."
CONVERSATION_2024,"Right."
CONVERSATION_2025,"No!"
CONVERSATION_2026,"This cannot be the end...!"
CONVERSATION_2027,"I will make sure it is!"
CONVERSATION_2028,"Wait, stop, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_2029,"Ouch!"
CONVERSATION_2030,"Argh."
CONVERSATION_2031,"Damn, mad ones were still on their mission."
CONVERSATION_2032,"Enemies!"
CONVERSATION_2033,"For El Rosed!"
CONVERSATION_2034,"Enough with this, Queen's dogs!"
CONVERSATION_2035,"Drat!"
CONVERSATION_2036,"You dirty pieces of waste!"
CONVERSATION_2037,"Enemies... Must die..."
CONVERSATION_2038,"Die!"
CONVERSATION_2039,"That's your death bed!"
CONVERSATION_2040,"You filthy bastards!"
CONVERSATION_2041,"That's where you will die and rot!"
CONVERSATION_2042,"This is crazy."
CONVERSATION_2043,"He's little too harsh to his own."
CONVERSATION_2044,"This is odd."
CONVERSATION_2045,"Mind-controlled is not a reason for that kind of hatred."
CONVERSATION_2046,"Is this some kind of dishonor in his culture?"
CONVERSATION_2047,"Phew, finally."
CONVERSATION_2048,"Now you know what I was talking about."
CONVERSATION_2049,"Let's go. I don't want to spend a second more here."
CONVERSATION_2050,"Couldn't agree more."
CONVERSATION_2051,"I'm with them, too. I can't wait to get out of here."
CONVERSATION_2052,"This is just too much."
CONVERSATION_2053,"Clause was worth it."
CONVERSATION_2054,"I can't find the right thing to say, that's why I don't say anything at all."
CONVERSATION_2055,"I saw you move. You are quite good at battle."
CONVERSATION_2056,"You don't look like a trained soldier, though."
CONVERSATION_2057,"Must have been hell of a journey that taught you, was it?"
CONVERSATION_2058,"That's none of your business."
CONVERSATION_2059,"Huh. There I thought humans love to brag their stories."
CONVERSATION_2060,"Wait."
CONVERSATION_2061,"Ew, that stench."
CONVERSATION_2062,"The Nucleus of Darkness is everywhere we go."
CONVERSATION_2063,"Yes, only the mainland of Orvelia was clear."
CONVERSATION_2064,"The return of the Dark Lord sounds much more plausible now."
CONVERSATION_2065,"I know, right? An artifact this powerful requires a great magic."
CONVERSATION_2066,"Only someone like the Dark Lord would be able to that."
CONVERSATION_2067,"So, that's the totem."
CONVERSATION_2068,"Frey, what can you tell?"
CONVERSATION_2069,"This is so evil."
CONVERSATION_2070,"It consumes elven life around it to generate the magic."
CONVERSATION_2071,"It's surely powerful but the host will die from within."
CONVERSATION_2072,"That's typical of all powers of evil."
CONVERSATION_2073,"Stupid men. Falling for that, and wasting their life force away."
CONVERSATION_2074,"Hey, up ahead is where we have to pass anyway."
CONVERSATION_2075,"Let's do it fast and thoroughly."
CONVERSATION_2076,"Well, I'm with him this time."
CONVERSATION_2077,"Frey, get ready."
CONVERSATION_2078,"I am. I'm always ready."
CONVERSATION_2079,"Ever since I decided to join this journey."
CONVERSATION_2080,"I'm not sure if I want to fight people who are not even themselves."
CONVERSATION_2081,"Roi, is it pity or hate that makes you say that?"
CONVERSATION_2082,"You decide. I'm helping!"
CONVERSATION_2083,"Haw..."
CONVERSATION_2084,"You are eating away yourself, why can't you see..."
CONVERSATION_2085,"The totem is gone. It should be okay now."
CONVERSATION_2086,"It's all mad. How can someone do this."
CONVERSATION_2087,"To sacrifice future to gain power for now..."
CONVERSATION_2088,"Hey, behind you!"
CONVERSATION_2089,"Huh?"
CONVERSATION_2090,"Frey!"
CONVERSATION_2091,"Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_2092,"I'm here, don't worry!"
CONVERSATION_2093,"I'm right next to you!"
CONVERSATION_2094,"No, please!"
CONVERSATION_2095,"No, Epigael!"
CONVERSATION_2096,"That's my sister, leave her alone!"
CONVERSATION_2097,"Stop it!"
CONVERSATION_2098,"Where is it coming from?"
CONVERSATION_2099,"I don't know. This doesn't seem to affect us at all."
CONVERSATION_2100,"I can't tell where."
CONVERSATION_2101,"Frey, wipe the whole area off!"
CONVERSATION_2102,"In the name of the Goddess Lua, I command you!"
CONVERSATION_2103,"Return to where you belong, darkness!"
CONVERSATION_2104,"I stand for the wrath of light,"
CONVERSATION_2105,"and you shall be destroyed!"
CONVERSATION_2106,"panting"
CONVERSATION_2107,"Hey, are you all right?"
CONVERSATION_2108,"What's wrong with you?"
CONVERSATION_2109,"Drat, Epigael..."
CONVERSATION_2110,"Avenge Epigael... avenge."
CONVERSATION_2111,"Hey!"
CONVERSATION_2112,"Never mind, it was personal."
CONVERSATION_2113,"I'm good."
CONVERSATION_2114,"It wasn't strong enough to take over a body."
CONVERSATION_2115,"Must be a part of process to confuse and brainwash people."
CONVERSATION_2116,"This way, please."
CONVERSATION_2117,"He called his sister."
CONVERSATION_2118,"Did he lose his sister, as well?"
CONVERSATION_2119,"That's why he didn't care about killing his own kind earlier."
CONVERSATION_2120,"I wonder what Clause would say to see us."
CONVERSATION_2121,"...Clause."
CONVERSATION_2122,"Do you see the fort over there?"
CONVERSATION_2123,"That's Fort Troy, the heart of the Dark Elves."
CONVERSATION_2124,"What are you doing!"
CONVERSATION_2125,"Enemies! Incoming attack!"
CONVERSATION_2126,"Don't miss them!"
CONVERSATION_2127,"Sorry. I didn't mean sidetrack from guiding your way."
CONVERSATION_2128,"They are not fully controlled."
CONVERSATION_2129,"They only react to strangers."
CONVERSATION_2130,"They won't be too hard to shake off."
CONVERSATION_2131,"You liar!"
CONVERSATION_2132,"Let me get him!"
CONVERSATION_2133,"No, Frey."
CONVERSATION_2134,"He's going right for the fort."
CONVERSATION_2135,"We are the bait."
CONVERSATION_2136,"Clause wouldn't try to take him at this point."
CONVERSATION_2137,"He'd rather help, if anything."
CONVERSATION_2138,"Right?"
CONVERSATION_2139,"Yeah, but..."
CONVERSATION_2140,"Come on, let's follow him."
CONVERSATION_2141,"This is not time to run."
CONVERSATION_2142,"If the dark magic is present, saving this place is our duty."
CONVERSATION_2143,"And I have the holy sword!"
CONVERSATION_2144,"If we stop here, all the fights don't mean anything!"
CONVERSATION_2145,"Come get me! I'm not afraid!"
CONVERSATION_2146,"Good. They are all out to chase them."
CONVERSATION_2147,"It would never happen if they were themselves..."
CONVERSATION_2148,"Except they aren't now. Nothing I can do about it."
CONVERSATION_2149,"Agamemnon, I've returned!"
CONVERSATION_2150,"I'm back to end you!"
CONVERSATION_2151,"You took away my life and I will make..."
CONVERSATION_2152,"Uhh... argh..."
CONVERSATION_2153,"What in the..."
CONVERSATION_2154,"Even you couldn't escape."
CONVERSATION_2155,"My sister was sacrificed and you couldn't stop it."
CONVERSATION_2156,"Look at you now."
CONVERSATION_2157,"Let's end this."
CONVERSATION_2158,"I'm done with the fate, all of it."
CONVERSATION_2159,"I have my revenge."
CONVERSATION_2160,"I thought it would change something..."
CONVERSATION_2161,"At least some resolution..."
CONVERSATION_2162,"It's all same."
CONVERSATION_2163,"This fort is the same. The fight goes on outside."
CONVERSATION_2164,"The world moves on just the same."
CONVERSATION_2165,"Everything I did... revenge... for what?"
CONVERSATION_2166,"Who's there?"
CONVERSATION_2167,"Why is anyone still here?"
CONVERSATION_2168,"Epigael?"
CONVERSATION_2169,"What are you doing?"
CONVERSATION_2170,"I ordered everyone to take care of the intruders!"
CONVERSATION_2171,"Epigael, it is you!"
CONVERSATION_2172,"This can't be a dream, it is you!"
CONVERSATION_2173,"Mind who you are speaking to!"
CONVERSATION_2174,"I'm your queen, El Rosed."
CONVERSATION_2175,"Somehow, you've broke free of my power. I don't allow that."
CONVERSATION_2176,"Your own death will be the proof how pitiful you are."
CONVERSATION_2177,"This cannot be..."
CONVERSATION_2178,"Dimael, move! What are you doing!"
CONVERSATION_2179,"Ouch!"
CONVERSATION_2180,"I don't understand. Why would Epigael attack me..."
CONVERSATION_2181,"Wake up, idiot!"
CONVERSATION_2182,"Pull yourself together and look!"
CONVERSATION_2183,"I will take the lead. We will take her alive if we can!"
CONVERSATION_2184,"Watch my back, please!"
CONVERSATION_2185,"Panting. After this, you will answer me."
CONVERSATION_2186,"You will be very sorry to make me go through this!"
CONVERSATION_2187,"Kasel! We are here to find the Nucleus of Darkness!"
CONVERSATION_2188,"Not to cut everything in pieces!"
CONVERSATION_2189,"I know, don't worry!"
CONVERSATION_2190,"He's useless now. We will be our own!"
CONVERSATION_2191,"Keep your guards up!"
CONVERSATION_2192,"Heeyah!"
CONVERSATION_2193,"Argh!"
CONVERSATION_2194,"Hi... brother..."
CONVERSATION_2195,"Epigael!"
CONVERSATION_2196,"It is you..."
CONVERSATION_2197,"Am I with Lua now?"
CONVERSATION_2198,"It's funny, you seem older in the afterlife. You look great..."
CONVERSATION_2199,"What are you talking about, Epigael?"
CONVERSATION_2200,"Can't you feel me holding you?"
CONVERSATION_2201,"You're not dead, we both aren't."
CONVERSATION_2202,"What happened to you. I thought you were gone."
CONVERSATION_2203,"The ceremony... do you remember?"
CONVERSATION_2204,"I was thrown off the cliff right over the pile of bodies."
CONVERSATION_2205,"There were so many of them and I was alive."
CONVERSATION_2206,"There I met this black knight."
CONVERSATION_2207,"He was neither demon nor human. He had this sad face."
CONVERSATION_2208,"He held my hands and show me you dying fighting for me."
CONVERSATION_2209,"I see now. It was all lie."
CONVERSATION_2210,"Oh brother... I wanted to avenge you."
CONVERSATION_2211,"You died trying to save me. I wanted them to pay."
CONVERSATION_2212,"I begged the black knight. I didn't care how,"
CONVERSATION_2213,"I just wanted power for my revenge."
CONVERSATION_2214,"And here I am."
CONVERSATION_2215,"That black knight! How dare he!"
CONVERSATION_2216,"He's the reason for all this!"
CONVERSATION_2217,"Hush, brother."
CONVERSATION_2218,"This happened because we all wanted revenge."
CONVERSATION_2219,"I'm going to regroup the Elves."
CONVERSATION_2220,"I will help your friends who helped saving me."
CONVERSATION_2221,"You mean us?"
CONVERSATION_2222,"Yes, my knight of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_2223,"I may still be a puppet but I am the queen regardless."
CONVERSATION_2224,"I can see and think on my own."
CONVERSATION_2225,"What? Holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_2226,"Is this true?"
CONVERSATION_2227,"Oh, yeah. We left that part out."
CONVERSATION_2228,"You weren't exactly trustworthy."
CONVERSATION_2229,"Yes, I'm the bearer of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_2230,"You're not just someone who carries it."
CONVERSATION_2231,"The sword chose you."
CONVERSATION_2232,"You proved your worth rather nobly."
CONVERSATION_2233,"I'm not sure about that."
CONVERSATION_2234,"Today at this fort, you learned forgiveness."
CONVERSATION_2235,"You didn't leave my brother who used you."
CONVERSATION_2236,"You decided to forgive, made a decision that saved two of us."
CONVERSATION_2237,"You are a hero for us."
CONVERSATION_2238,"Thank you."
CONVERSATION_2239,"I'm a little ashamed. I didn't trust him until the end."
CONVERSATION_2240,"Impressive, Kasel. You forgave."
CONVERSATION_2241,"I can only imagine how hard it was."
CONVERSATION_2242,"I will help Epigael to get the Elves back. They must be confused."
CONVERSATION_2243,"Have to hurry before it causes other problems."
CONVERSATION_2244,"I wish I had time to repay you right now."
CONVERSATION_2245,"I didn't do it for a reward."
CONVERSATION_2246,"How knightly, indeed."
CONVERSATION_2247,"You said you're heading to Windland?"
CONVERSATION_2248,"I don't lie."
CONVERSATION_2249,"Take that road. It will lead you there."
CONVERSATION_2250,"You will still have to pass through Aegina."
CONVERSATION_2251,"Thank you."
CONVERSATION_2252,"That black knight, though..."
CONVERSATION_2253,"He was a knight in black armor."
CONVERSATION_2254,"Not human, and not demon... so ominous..."
CONVERSATION_2255,"He seemed like chaos himself."
CONVERSATION_2256,"Not good. I never heard of such a thing."
CONVERSATION_2257,"Neither a human nor a demon... What is it?"
CONVERSATION_2258,"We should head to Windland. Maybe Phillop knows something."
CONVERSATION_2259,"You are right!"
CONVERSATION_2260,"That's a good idea."
CONVERSATION_2261,"I'm sorry, Dimael."
CONVERSATION_2262,"For doubting you the whole time."
CONVERSATION_2263,"No, don't be."
CONVERSATION_2264,"Although... Something tells me you lost someone dear."
CONVERSATION_2265,"Your eyes, both of you, had that sadness I was bearing."
CONVERSATION_2266,"Didn't mean to pry. It's an elf thing."
CONVERSATION_2267,"Allow me to tell you one thing I learned."
CONVERSATION_2268,"Vengeance only leads to tragedy. Remember us."
CONVERSATION_2269,"Don't confuse the real enemy."
CONVERSATION_2270,"Dully noted."
CONVERSATION_2271,"Thank you."
CONVERSATION_2272,"Now then, let's be on our way."
CONVERSATION_2273,"This was yet another great story for my biography!"
CONVERSATION_2274,"Well, this was a story worth telling."
CONVERSATION_2275,"It's weird to suddenly hear praises from you, Mr. Roi."
CONVERSATION_2276,"I do it because you can't take it when I'm nice."
CONVERSATION_2277,"You're hopeless."
CONVERSATION_2278,"Hey! Can I go with you?"
CONVERSATION_2279,"Haha, Kasel, I wish you could come along..."
CONVERSATION_2280,"But you're still a squire! I can't take you on a real expedition."
CONVERSATION_2281,"As a squire of Orvelia, you know the rules, right?"
CONVERSATION_2282,"I do know how to fight!"
CONVERSATION_2283,"Sorry, but it's too risky to take you with us."
CONVERSATION_2284,"Under reported information, it might be quite dangerous."
CONVERSATION_2285,"Don't you think you should have as many knights as possible?"
CONVERSATION_2286,"No. Sorry but, No is No."
CONVERSATION_2287,"But, when this is all over, why don't we go somewhere nice with Frey, maybe?"
CONVERSATION_2288,"Yeah. Be careful. I don't have a good feeling about this."
CONVERSATION_2289,"Rumors tell that... this is related to something like the Dark Legion..."
CONVERSATION_2290,"Haha. Kasel, what do you think the Royal Knight is?"
CONVERSATION_2291,"You would surely know that we're not the least weak. You've seen it, right?"
CONVERSATION_2292,"Well... yeah. You're right. But promise me to be careful."
CONVERSATION_2293,"Sure. And you're gonna practice every single day, right?"
CONVERSATION_2294,"Ok... ok... I got it..."
CONVERSATION_2295,"Kasel, you'll be a knight one day. I know that you're gonna make it through well."
CONVERSATION_2296,"And if something happens what you should really do, then, I'll help you out."
CONVERSATION_2297,"Wh...Why are you saying that? It's not like you."
CONVERSATION_2298,"You know, I'm a man who can speak some cool words sometimes, Hahaha!"
CONVERSATION_2299,"Well then, I should be at the front."
CONVERSATION_2300,"In honor of the Royal Knights of Orvelia!"
CONVERSATION_2301,"Take care, and come back in one piece ok?"
CONVERSATION_2303,"Kasel! Where are you going?"
CONVERSATION_2304,"F...Frey. I just um... you know..."
CONVERSATION_2305,"You're on your way to find brother Clause, right?"
CONVERSATION_2306,"Yeah... can't stop thinking... just... I just can't sit around doing nothing."
CONVERSATION_2307,"You're still a squire!"
CONVERSATION_2308,"The Great Priestess said that this expedition is dangerous!"
CONVERSATION_2309,"What? What did the Great Priestess say?"
CONVERSATION_2310,"Ha... she said that I shouldn't tell anything to you about this..."
CONVERSATION_2311,"Come on! Tell me!"
CONVERSATION_2312,"It's very important to me!"
CONVERSATION_2313,"hu... she's gonna be really angry at me with this..."
CONVERSATION_2314,"Frey! Just tell me ok?"
CONVERSATION_2315,"Well... whatever..."
CONVERSATION_2316,"Crazy times."
CONVERSATION_2317,"Kasel, do you remember the story?"
CONVERSATION_2318,"The story of the Dark Lord Angmund and the Holy Sword Aea?"
CONVERSATION_2319,"And the World Tree where Aea has been sealed?"
CONVERSATION_2320,"What does that have to do with this expedition?"
CONVERSATION_2321,"I'm not sure but..."
CONVERSATION_2322,"The Great Priestess said she heard a prophecy."
CONVERSATION_2323,"She said something about Aea crying."
CONVERSATION_2324,"Maybe... No. Nonono... this kind of imagination is not good."
CONVERSATION_2325,"Come on Frey!"
CONVERSATION_2326,"I think Angmund is still alive..."
CONVERSATION_2327,"And it is somehow related to Aea."
CONVERSATION_2328,"This expedition of the Royal Knight lead by Clause,"
CONVERSATION_2329,"I think it has something to do with Angmund"
CONVERSATION_2330,"Angmund... the Dark Lord!!"
CONVERSATION_2331,"I need to go, Frey."
CONVERSATION_2332,"I must go."
CONVERSATION_2333,"I'm so worried about Clause."
CONVERSATION_2334,"No Kasel! You're not ready!"
CONVERSATION_2335,"The Royal Knight will handle this."
CONVERSATION_2336,"Frey... I need to go."
CONVERSATION_2337,"He's my brother. My brother... Frey."
CONVERSATION_2338,"Hu... lord Lua... be with us..."
CONVERSATION_2339,"Frey, I have to find my brother."
CONVERSATION_2340,"I'm leaving."
CONVERSATION_2341,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_2342,"If you need to go, then I'll go too."
CONVERSATION_2343,"Still not good enough but..."
CONVERSATION_2344,"I'll go with you!"
CONVERSATION_2345,"Frey...?"
CONVERSATION_2346,"Why? You don't trust me because I'm an apprentice?"
CONVERSATION_2347,"Hey! I can protect a squire like you!"
CONVERSATION_2348,"Frey... This is a dangerous Quest."
CONVERSATION_2349,"I know! So that's why I need to go..."
CONVERSATION_2350,"with you..."
CONVERSATION_2351,"Okay. I can't be so sure..."
CONVERSATION_2352,"Okay. Let's go then."
CONVERSATION_2353,"But please promise that you will stay right behind me, okay?"
CONVERSATION_2354,"There will be some danger."
CONVERSATION_2355,"Ok. Let's go!"
CONVERSATION_2379,"... please?"
CONVERSATION_2391,"Whew... A tough fight."
CONVERSATION_2396,"If we knock him out, the others won't come after us anymore."
CONVERSATION_2397,"A pack of wolves right in front of the castle...?"
CONVERSATION_2398,"I hope Clause is okay..."
CONVERSATION_2399,"Hey! No time for sentimentalism!"
CONVERSATION_2400,"The wolves are coming!"
CONVERSATION_2401,"Phew... It wasn't an easy fight."
CONVERSATION_2402,"Frey, it could've been quite risky if it was just the two of us."
CONVERSATION_2403,"But at the same time, it's a great dishonor to fight alongside a PERVERT!"
CONVERSATION_2404,"Ah... hey, hey. Lady."
CONVERSATION_2405,"Stop calling me a pervert. You shouldn't misjudge someone you don't know so easily."
CONVERSATION_2426,"Hehe. We're fine, Mr. Roi."
CONVERSATION_2427,"Miss Cleo seems to have her own reasons."
CONVERSATION_2428,"Anyway, everyone is safe and that's all we need."
CONVERSATION_2429,"Haha. Yes, it's a relief that no one is hurt."
CONVERSATION_2438,"... Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_2439,"That is..."
CONVERSATION_2440,"Excuse me, handsome knight?"
CONVERSATION_2441,"Hu? Yes?"
CONVERSATION_2442,"You're heading to the World Tree, right?"
CONVERSATION_2443,"Ah... Yeah."
CONVERSATION_2444,"But, how did you know?"
CONVERSATION_2445,"Everybody knows that something is going on there."
CONVERSATION_2446,"Then! Take me with you!"
CONVERSATION_2447,"Me?"
CONVERSATION_2448,"I've seen in that fight."
CONVERSATION_2449,"You will definitely need help."
CONVERSATION_2450,"The best that you two can do is just not to be dead."
CONVERSATION_2451,"I'll help!"
CONVERSATION_2452,"but, we are..."
CONVERSATION_2453,"Kasel, why don't just ask to with us?"
CONVERSATION_2454,"You just said that it would have been dangerous if it was just the two of us?"
CONVERSATION_2455,"Frey!"
CONVERSATION_2456,"This is a dangerous Quest!"
CONVERSATION_2457,"( And we don't know who they are! )"
CONVERSATION_2458,"Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_2459,"You really gonna..."
CONVERSATION_2460,"Roi, make a decision."
CONVERSATION_2461,"Let me go! Or let me hate you forever!"
CONVERSATION_2462,"Hatred from a witch is something you should fear, and you know that!"
CONVERSATION_2463,"Hoooo..."
CONVERSATION_2464,"..."
CONVERSATION_2465,"Okay. I don't think I can stop you."
CONVERSATION_2470,"Well... it seems like we have no choice but to go together."
CONVERSATION_2471,"Haha..."
CONVERSATION_2473,"I'm Cleo, and I'm a sorceress from the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2475,"Her bodyguard, from the Red Tower..."
CONVERSATION_2479,"Nice to meet you all!"
CONVERSATION_2480,"Ok then! Let's go!"
CONVERSATION_2481,"Hah..."
CONVERSATION_2482,"Hahaha...."
CONVERSATION_2492,"Anyway, witch. Why are you heading to the World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_2493,"Hey! Don't call me witch! I do have a name. It's Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_2494,"Ah. Yes, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_2495,"Yes! Yes! Good!"
CONVERSATION_2496,"So... why are you going to the World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_2497,"Well... that's because..."
CONVERSATION_2498,"Wow, more cute slime!"
CONVERSATION_2499,"Wai...Wait!"
CONVERSATION_2500,"We gotta deal with this first."
CONVERSATION_2501,"Yet I still didn't hear the reason,"
CONVERSATION_2502,"So... why are you going to the World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_2503,"That's because... It's a Secret!"
CONVERSATION_2504,"But, we're moving together and it's just uncomfortable not knowing why..."
CONVERSATION_2505,"No! Girls have secrets, don't you know!?"
CONVERSATION_2506,"Oh, dear..."
CONVERSATION_2519,"Hmm, slime is a little hard to cut."
CONVERSATION_2520,"Hahaha...."
CONVERSATION_2521,"You're not hurt anywhere, are you?"
CONVERSATION_2522,"I would be very glad if he gets hurt!"
CONVERSATION_2523,"That's something I can't do for you."
CONVERSATION_2524,"I've never seen such thing around here before..."
CONVERSATION_2525,"Do you think this is somehow related to changes happening near the World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_2526,"Hmm, I definitely felt something evil from that slime."
CONVERSATION_2527,"It's weird that I felt the demon force from such a low-class creature."
CONVERSATION_2528,"Me, too. Never saw slime like that before."
CONVERSATION_2529,"Perhaps... this is what the Great Priestess said..."
CONVERSATION_2530,"The Great Priestess?"
CONVERSATION_2531,"Oh, no. It's nothing."
CONVERSATION_2532,"Huh?"
CONVERSATION_2533,"You see, the road is clear so let's move on!"
CONVERSATION_2534,"(Is she hiding something...?)"
CONVERSATION_2535,"?"
CONVERSATION_2588,"Sorry to hear that."
CONVERSATION_2589,"(Familiar name...)"
CONVERSATION_2599,"Revenge only generates sadness and hatred."
CONVERSATION_2600,"But...!"
CONVERSATION_2601,"Okay. But I won't forgive him."
CONVERSATION_2602,"Frey, you know what Brian was to me..."
CONVERSATION_2603,"He also was like a father to me..."
CONVERSATION_2604,"But..."
CONVERSATION_2605,"Whew... the air is too heavy."
CONVERSATION_2606,"Cheer up, let's move on to the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_2607,"Ah... okay."
CONVERSATION_2608,"..."
CONVERSATION_2609,"Roi..."
CONVERSATION_2629,"You kid!"
CONVERSATION_2631,"Shoot. Looks like it can't be helped."
CONVERSATION_2632,"We must make it quick!"
CONVERSATION_2636,"Hey, hey. Calm down."
CONVERSATION_2637,"Anyway, it worked out okay, right?"
CONVERSATION_2638,"So reckless..."
CONVERSATION_2639,"There are still much more mushrooms!"
CONVERSATION_2640,"Ewww, I wonder why so many creatures are flooding over!"
CONVERSATION_2641,"Yes... we did come far from the castle but,"
CONVERSATION_2642,"There wasn't that many of those here before..."
CONVERSATION_2643,"Anyhow, we've gotta deal with it...!"
CONVERSATION_2682,"It's them!"
CONVERSATION_2683,"The ones who killed Brian had those laughing masks on their faces!"
CONVERSATION_2684,"Talk about bad timing..."
CONVERSATION_2685,"Roi! Tell me! How do they know you!?"
CONVERSATION_2686,"Ha, is something wrong?"
CONVERSATION_2687,"Of course, we know him and seems like you didn't know."
CONVERSATION_2688,"He was one of us, the Laughing Masks."
CONVERSATION_2689,"..."
CONVERSATION_2690,"Wha... What!!"
CONVERSATION_2691,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_2692,"Tell me, Roi! Is that true!"
CONVERSATION_2693,"..."
CONVERSATION_2694,"Yes, it is."
CONVERSATION_2695,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_2705,"You murdered Brian! I will get my vengeance!"
CONVERSATION_2706,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_2711,"Kuhahahaha! Okay, Roi."
CONVERSATION_2712,"I'll give you a hint as an old friend."
CONVERSATION_2713,"You should keep an eye on Orvel."
CONVERSATION_2714,"What?"
CONVERSATION_2715,"You won't understand at this moment."
CONVERSATION_2716,"So long, punks."
CONVERSATION_2717,"Stop!!!"
CONVERSATION_2718,"Kasel, No!"
CONVERSATION_2719,"Don't worry. We'll meet again. Hahahahaha!"
CONVERSATION_2720,"Stop right there!!"
CONVERSATION_2721,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_2722,"..."
CONVERSATION_2723,"Roi... Why?"
CONVERSATION_2724,"Say what you want to say."
CONVERSATION_2725,"Did you..."
CONVERSATION_2726,"You what to know if it was ME who killed Brian, right?"
CONVERSATION_2727,"Yes!"
CONVERSATION_2728,"No."
CONVERSATION_2729,"..."
CONVERSATION_2730,"..."
CONVERSATION_2731,"Is... Is that all?"
CONVERSATION_2732,"I didn't kill him and that's all."
CONVERSATION_2733,"Yes, of course I did some bad things back when I was a Laughing Mask."
CONVERSATION_2734,"Then I won't forgive you!"
CONVERSATION_2735,"So what? Are you gonna kill me?"
CONVERSATION_2736,"...!"
CONVERSATION_2737,"If you want that, I accept your challenge."
CONVERSATION_2738,"I have things to do."
CONVERSATION_2739,"If you're really going to do this, then I'll have to kill you too."
CONVERSATION_2740,"T--T-That's..."
CONVERSATION_2741,"What's the matter? Are you afraid to risk your life?"
CONVERSATION_2742,"You'll do nothing with that weak mind."
CONVERSATION_2743,"You'll never get your revenge nor protect anyone safe..."
CONVERSATION_2744,"Urgh..."
CONVERSATION_2745,"Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2746,"..."
CONVERSATION_2747,"Miss Cleo, let's go."
CONVERSATION_2748,"Hu? Oh... Okay."
CONVERSATION_2749,"Hey! Wait!"
CONVERSATION_2750,"Is there something you want to say, kid?"
CONVERSATION_2751,"Or are you ready to risk your life?"
CONVERSATION_2752,"Yes, I do have courage enough to risk my life!"
CONVERSATION_2753,"Because of that! Because I know that you're strong!"
CONVERSATION_2754,"I ask you to come with us to find my brother."
CONVERSATION_2755,"What did you say?"
CONVERSATION_2756,"My brother, Clause, who's more important than my life, is in big danger!"
CONVERSATION_2757,"So, I'm asking you to come and help us, because I know that you're strong!"
CONVERSATION_2758,"... Maybe you're gonna cut me down one day... but..."
CONVERSATION_2759,"Hah... That's not going to happen."
CONVERSATION_2760,"I left the Laughing Masks. I also quit living as an assassin."
CONVERSATION_2761,"I was running from them marked as a betrayer and hid into the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2762,"And then, someone came to help me out."
CONVERSATION_2763,"Dominics... Cleo's teacher over there."
CONVERSATION_2773,"Hahaha...."
CONVERSATION_2774,"So, are you coming with us?"
CONVERSATION_2775,"Well, can you trust me?"
CONVERSATION_2776,"No. I can't."
CONVERSATION_2777,"But to be honest, I need a strong party to find my brother, Clause."
CONVERSATION_2778,"For that, I realized that I need you and Cleo."
CONVERSATION_2779,"Yes... I can see that you want to protect somebody."
CONVERSATION_2780,"Anyway, what the guy from the Laughing Masks said..."
CONVERSATION_2781,"Keep an eye on Orvel..."
CONVERSATION_2782,"Is Orvel in grave danger?"
CONVERSATION_2783,"Well... Me neither know what that means."
CONVERSATION_2784,"Hmm... anyway. It's been delayed."
CONVERSATION_2785,"Why don't we all just move on?"
CONVERSATION_2786,"I'm not a tomboy!"
CONVERSATION_2790,"Argh... goblins..."
CONVERSATION_2791,"They usually don't attack people ruthlessly like this..."
CONVERSATION_2792,"Goblins normally avoid people who are bigger than they are."
CONVERSATION_2793,"This situation is hard to understand."
CONVERSATION_2794,"Unless someone is conducting..."
CONVERSATION_2795,"Conducting? Who?"
CONVERSATION_2796,"How would I know?"
CONVERSATION_2797,"(Has Angmund really been resurrected...?)"
CONVERSATION_2798,"There's another group of goblins over there."
CONVERSATION_2799,"This time the size of their group isn't like before."
CONVERSATION_2800,"I think the goblins we met before were just scouts."
CONVERSATION_2801,"Proceeding like this, we might have to deal with the whole army of goblins."
CONVERSATION_2802,"Is there any other way to avoid this?"
CONVERSATION_2803,"There is a way to go around but..."
CONVERSATION_2804,"It will double the time."
CONVERSATION_2805,"We don't have that time."
CONVERSATION_2806,"Looks like there's no better choice. Then we're going through."
CONVERSATION_2807,"Kasel! Are you going to put everyone in danger?"
CONVERSATION_2808,"But... Clause is..."
CONVERSATION_2809,"Frey, do you think we're still gonna be in danger, even with my fire magic?"
CONVERSATION_2810,"Well, maybe Roi will be the only one who can't dodge my fire?"
CONVERSATION_2811,"The only thing I'm worried about is just you, dumb Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_2812,"Everyone, be careful please."
CONVERSATION_2813,"Okay, I'm going through! Help me out!"
CONVERSATION_2814,"We're going to the World Tree!"
CONVERSATION_2815,"OK! let's go!"
CONVERSATION_2816,"May Lua be with us..."
CONVERSATION_2845,"Argh... my armor is still very hot."
CONVERSATION_2846,"That was a lethal weapon."
CONVERSATION_2847,"You see? My fire is much hotter!"
CONVERSATION_2848,"Hey! It's very hot! Watch out?!"
CONVERSATION_2849,"See, see! My fire is bigger, isn't it?"
CONVERSATION_2850,"Let's just say that you're right."
CONVERSATION_2851,"What's that to just say that I'm right... Bah!"
CONVERSATION_2852,"I can see that Miss Cleo has great pride in her fire skills."
CONVERSATION_2853,"Is there a reason why you are using the fire?"
CONVERSATION_2854,"Yes, of course there is!"
CONVERSATION_2855,"Best visual! And Flashy! Pupupung!"
CONVERSATION_2856,"Isn't it?"
CONVERSATION_2857,"Let's just say that you're right."
CONVERSATION_2858,"Let's just say that she's right."
CONVERSATION_2859,"Must I also say, let's just say that she's right?"
CONVERSATION_2860,"What's that! Sincerely admit that my fire magic is the best!"
CONVERSATION_2930,"If we go north-west pass this point,"
CONVERSATION_2931,"We'll be at the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_2932,"Clause should be safe..."
CONVERSATION_2933,"If there are much goblins like this here,"
CONVERSATION_2934,"I doubt that situation in the World Tree would be good."
CONVERSATION_2935,"Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2936,"Yeah. It might... but..."
CONVERSATION_2937,"Clause will be okay! He's gonna be fine."
CONVERSATION_2938,"Yes, Kasel. Clause is a strong knight."
CONVERSATION_2939,"I wish we weren't late."
CONVERSATION_2940,"If you're that worried, we'd better move now."
CONVERSATION_2941,"We should get pass this point."
CONVERSATION_2942,"Okay!"
CONVERSATION_2943,"(Hold on, Clause!)"
