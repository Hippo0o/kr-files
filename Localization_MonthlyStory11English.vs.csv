E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_01,"Happy birthday, Lady Aisha!"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_02,Your beauty shines brighter every day! I'm afraid my present may look dull compared to your beauty.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_03,"Also, look at this gorgeous garden! This place is perfect for hosting parties."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_04,What a place befitting the esteemed lady of the Daphnel Family.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_05,"Thank you, everyone. You are all too kind with your compliments. And thank you all for making the time to visit my party."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_06,"May I have the honor of dancing with you, Lady Aisha?"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_07,"I thank you for the offer, but I have other guests to attend to."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_08,Then may I accompany you for a walk over there?
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_09,I really have to attend to other guests. I’m afraid I have to refuse.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_10,But thank you for your kind offer.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_11,There really is no end to this... This is why I told my father that I don’t need a birthday party.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_12,If only my father didn’t insist so much on hosting it...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_13,"Oh, Prisci-"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_14,"Oh, there you are! Happy birthday, Lady Aisha!"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_15,Th-thank you. It's been a while.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_16,"Were you surprised? Please forgive me, I was just too excited to see you."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_17,It’s alright. How have you been?
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_18,"Ugh, I didn't get to hear happy birthday from the one I really wanted to hear it from..."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_19,"It's my birthday, for crying out loud."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_20,"You look drained. I don't blame you, there are so many people here."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_21,"I'm fine, thank you. Everyone is here to congratulate my birthday, after all."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_22,I should greet them as best as I can.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_23,I wanted to have a quiet birthday this year...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_24,"Oh well, what can I do... This is my duty."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_25,"She must be nervous, yet she greets them with poise."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_26,Expected of the esteemed lady of a reputable noble family.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_27,Excuse me! I need some help here!
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_28,Right away!
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_29,"By the way, Priscilla, did you say happy birthday to Lady Aisha?"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_30,"Not yet, no. The lady is busy, and I too have-"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_31,I see... I guess it can't be helped. I’m sure her ladyship will understand.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_32,I hope she does...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_33,It's no use... It's not like I can push aside the guests and speak to her.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_34,"I do have a gift for her, but... I’m not sure if I can give it to her by today."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_35,"Priscilla! Over here, please!"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_36,I’m going!
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_37,It’s already late at night...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_38,I didn't know that it was this hard to host and maintain a party like this...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_39,Ugh! Seriously! When will this darn party end?!
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_40,I wonder if Lady Aisha is okay... She looks exhausted...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_41,I had so much fun today. Please come to the party held at my mansion next time!
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_42,Thank you. Please take care.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_43,It’s finally over... I’m so exhausted... I can finally rest now...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_44,I wonder what time it is now. 30 minutes to midnight?
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_45,"Wait, it's this late already?!"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_46,You must be exhausted. Let’s clean up tomorrow morning. We should go to bed now.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_47,It’s quite late and tomorrow is about to start...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_48,"That sounds like a good--wait, what time is it now?!"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_49,10 minutes until midnight...
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_50,L-lady Aisha! I need to speak to you!
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_51,Priscilla! So good to see you! I-
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_52,"Forgive me, but please come to my side."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_53,Huh?
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_54,"You must be really tired, but please..."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_55,I really need to tell you this now.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_56,It’s okay. How about you Priscilla? Aren't you exhausted?
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_57,"I’m alright, my lady. Now..."
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_58,"Happy birthday, Lady Aisha. Although this isn't anything big,"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_59,I really wanted to give this to you by today.
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_60,"Anything is fine as long as it’s from you, Priscilla!"
E_C19_Nov_Aisha01_61,This is the best gift I've received today. Thank you so much!
E_C19_Nov_May01_01,Na-na-na! Lalala!
E_C19_Nov_May01_02,"Wow, May looks really happy."
E_C19_Nov_May01_03,"Well, her birthday is coming up soon... She’s going to get more and more cheerful."
E_C19_Nov_May01_04,What should I get her this year?
E_C19_Nov_May01_05,Luna! Luna has something she wants to do!
E_C19_Nov_May01_06,Luna wants to give a ‘surprise gift’ to May!
E_C19_Nov_May01_07,A ‘surprise gift?’
E_C19_Nov_May01_08,"Yes! So, it's..."
E_C19_Nov_May01_09,D-2
E_C19_Nov_May01_10,"Ooh, this is cute. How much is this?"
E_C19_Nov_May01_11,Hmm... I should wait and buy it for my birthday later!
E_C19_Nov_May01_12,"Firework Workshop? Wow, this looks interesting... and fun."
E_C19_Nov_May01_13,"But unfortunately, I don't have the time right now..."
E_C19_Nov_May01_14,D-1
E_C19_Nov_May01_15,"Ooh! Oh wow, I really want this one!"
E_C19_Nov_May01_16,"Let's see how much I have... Oh no, maybe next time."
E_C19_Nov_May01_17,What is it?
E_C19_Nov_May01_18,"Hey Luna! Ah, I was just talking about this one."
E_C19_Nov_May01_19,Hmm? You want that one? Should I sell my carrots?
E_C19_Nov_May01_20,"Eh, I don’t think you can get enough money by selling carrots..."
E_C19_Nov_May01_21,Aww...
E_C19_Nov_May01_22,It’s okay. I can cut some expenses here and there to gather extra cash.
E_C19_Nov_May01_23,"But then again, it is my birthday... Maybe I should just take some money from my savings--"
E_C19_Nov_May01_24,Huh?
E_C19_Nov_May01_25,"Ah, never mind! Where are you off to, Luna?"
E_C19_Nov_May01_26,"Luna was going to the forest to hang out! Wanna come, May?"
E_C19_Nov_May01_27,I'll pass. I have to go back to the store... Let’s play together next time.
E_C19_Nov_May01_28,Okay! I will see you next time then! Bye-bye!
E_C19_Nov_May01_29,D-Day
E_C19_Nov_May01_30,"Wow, what a beautiful day."
E_C19_Nov_May01_31,So glad the weather is great today!
E_C19_Nov_May01_32,Good day! Here’s a letter for you!
E_C19_Nov_May01_33,A letter?
E_C19_Nov_May01_34,It doesn't have a name on it. I wonder who sent it.
E_C19_Nov_May01_35,Huh? An invitation?
E_C19_Nov_May01_36,"Wow, wow, wow!! Its an invitation to the Firework Workshop!"
E_C19_Nov_May01_37,I was going to go sign up for this today!
E_C19_Nov_May01_38,...I really wonder who sent me this.
E_C19_Nov_May01_39,Na-na-na! Lalala!
E_C19_Nov_May01_40,It was around here... Let’s see.
E_C19_Nov_May01_41,Congratulations! This is our gift to the
E_C19_Nov_May01_42,one who made the biggest and coolest firework!
E_C19_Nov_May01_43,Huh?
E_C19_Nov_May01_44,I've never heard of an event like that before.
E_C19_Nov_May01_45,"Eh, whatever. I guess it started today."
E_C19_Nov_May01_46,Yay! Thank you!
E_C19_Nov_May01_47,"Now, Juno said she will make dinner. I should-"
E_C19_Nov_May01_48,Hmm? A parcel this time?
E_C19_Nov_May01_49,"Let’s see... It says, ‘Thank you every day!’"
E_C19_Nov_May01_50,I wonder who sent this... I might know who it is.. Or maybe not..
E_C19_Nov_May01_51,Let’s see what's inside... Whoa!!
E_C19_Nov_May01_52,Huh...
E_C19_Nov_May01_53,Huhhh?!?!?!
E_C19_Nov_May01_54,"Welcome, May! Happy birthday!"
E_C19_Nov_May01_55,"Happy birthday, May! I’ve brought you some carrots!"
E_C19_Nov_May01_56,"Thank you, Juno! You are here too, Luna! Thank you!"
E_C19_Nov_May01_57,"Hey, May, did you have a good time today?"
E_C19_Nov_May01_58,Oh yes! I had a perfect time!
E_C19_Nov_May01_59,I see! You had a good day! That’s good!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_1,"Hehehe, another lovely day!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_2,"Now I’m gonna have a quick breakfast, and open the store."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_3,"Oh, right! And I have to pray to Goddess Lua. May she grant me fortune today!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_4,"It’s my birthday today, so business will boom today!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_5,Welcome! Welcome!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_6,Welcome to Requina’s General Store! Today is the medicinal ingredient day!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_7,"All kinds of medicinal ingredients are on sale today. Pick one, take one!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_8,They are all super effective! I only sell ingredients that were proven effective through clinical trials!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_9,...How much for those mushrooms?
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_10,"20,000 Gold per pack!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_11,That product is on a bonus deal. It's buy one get one free!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_12,It’s good for coughs and runny noses when it's boiled.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_13,"But don't crush it. If you use it in its powder form, it can cause breathing difficulty and paralysis. Please take caution when using it."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_14,...Note taken. I'll be careful.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_15,How much is this grass?
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_16,"Oh, that’s 5,000 Gold per pack!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_17,Apply in onto a scar after boiling and grinding. It will stop the bleeding!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_18,"But, if you don’t boil it,"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_19,"it will harden the blood in other areas as well, so be careful!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_20,"Hello, Requina."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_21,You have so many customers today.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_22,"Oh, hello, Mediana!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_23,"Ah, my VIP customer has arrived. What kind of research brought you here today?"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_24,"Ahaha, actually, I’m not here for research."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_25,"Here, a present for you."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_26,"Wow, you remembered my birthday?"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_27,Thank you!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_28,Ooh! Hmm. This drug has such a pretty color.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_29,"Fufufu, Yanne caught me a rare Muhroom not too long ago. I ground it and made it into a... medication."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_30,"In the right dose, it becomes an excellent tranquilizer. It’s great for self-defense."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_31,"Too much, however, can cause symptoms of hallucination. So please use it carefully."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_32,"Hehehe, thank you."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_33,I’m sure I will have uses for it.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_34,"And since I’m here, can I order some poisonous mushrooms and poisonous plants?"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_35,In a large quantity. You know where to deliver it... right?
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_36,"Hehehe... Of course, my dear customer."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_37,See you then!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_38,*Yawn...* A prayer to the goddess on my birthday always works.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_39,"Business is good, my mood is good... I don’t want to go to bed to end the day just yet though..."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_40,Now would've been the perfect time to test poison! Too bad there are no patients today.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_41,"This is the end for you, Merchant of Death."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_42,Huh?
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_43,You dare to sell poison to our rival?
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_44,Our day was ruined because of you!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_45,What? I don't even-
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_46,Shut up!!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_47,"Wait, that’s!!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_48,This must be one of your precious poisons.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_49,I will kill you with your own invention!!!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_50,What the... Th-this smell...
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_51,Hehehe... Thank you for inhaling the poison yourself...
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_52,I can easily get rid of you now! Hehe!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_53,Ahhh! Wh-what is this?! H-how did you multiply?!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_54,D-don’t tell me y-you sold poison to--
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_55,You catch on so slowly! What a fool!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_56,I can't let you escape alive now...
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_57,I will kill you slowly... and painfully with my poison.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_58,Ahhhh!! Somebody help!!!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_59,Help... Hel...
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_60,*Sigh* I can't believe he actually touched Mediana’s drug.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_61,That drug is really something though. Mediana really is an expert.
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_62,Oh! Good!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_63,I can use this person to test my poison!
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_64,"Don’t worry, though. I don't kill people with poison... Tee hee."
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_65,"We will do great things together, you and I. Hohoho!"
E_C19_Nov_Requina01_66,I really am lucky on my birthday!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_1,"Excellent job today, Reina."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_2,"Hehe, this is nothing!"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_3,"Fufu. You are always so cheerful and bright, Reina. It's nice."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_4,Here is your payment for this task.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_5,And this is my present to you.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_6,Huh? A present?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_7,This looks so expensive... Are you sure I can have this?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_8,"Fufu, you are my valuable customer, after all."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_9,I can't just ignore the birthday of someone so precious.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_10,H-how did you know today was my birthday in the first place?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_11,"Well, actually, you are the most famous information dealer in all of the Empire, after all, hehe."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_12,Thank you for your present! I will put it to good use!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_13,"Actually, I wanted to buy you a beautiful accessory..."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_14,Then I realized that you already had one. That’s why I prepared something else.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_15,"Oh, this?"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_16,"Hehe, this is also a birthday gift from someone."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_17,"To be exact, I kinda...sorta forced it from him."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_18,"Oh, do I hear an interesting story?"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_19,Well... it’s a long story...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_20,"(Wait, hang on...)"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_21,Stop!!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_22,"Ugh, where did he go?!"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_23,Just you wait and see! I’m not going to let you run away!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_24,Mister!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_25,Strange mister!!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_26,Did you fly up in the air?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_27,Or did you dig a hole underground and hide inside?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_28,What a dilemma.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_29,I can’t just leave her like that... What should I do?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_30,"*Huff, huff* found you... Strange mister!!"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_31,I’m not going to let you run away now!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_32,Sign a contract with me! Let’s work together!!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_33,You still have that much energy left? What an energetic young lady you are.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_34,"But like I said before, I have something very important I must do."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_35,"I can’t sign a contract, let alone work with you."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_36,Aw... But I need that portal you use...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_37,It takes too much effort running around. It's also very tiring...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_38,But you were running around really enthusiastically just now.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_39,That’s because I had to keep up with you...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_40,Hmm...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_41,"You really are fast, young lady. You are probably the fastest person I’ve ever seen."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_42,But I think you already know that.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_43,Why do you seek my ability?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_44,....
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_45,....To...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_46,Mm?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_47,....To run away...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_48,....Run away?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_49,When someone gives me a contract that I don't want to do... I just want to run away from it.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_50,There are so many people who look down on me because I’m young and inexperienced.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_51,They look down on me! They just hand me contracts without asking me!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_52,...I see...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_53,"Yes, I wish people realize what I'm capable of!"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_54,But it's no use if I only get strange contracts! I hate it!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_55,I just want to... run away from people like that...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_56,(Now that I've heard her story... I can't just send her away like this... What should I do?)
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_57,"(Ah, there was that.)"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_58,"...Like I said before, I can't go with you."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_59,"However, I can give you this."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_60,What is this?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_61,This will make you really fast.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_62,"With this, you may be able to move as fast as light."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_63,Perhaps you may outspeed me even.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_64,That’s awesome!!!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_65,One should not run away from his or her duty and responsibility.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_66,That is...if you are an adult.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_67,You are still young to embrace all that.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_68,Mister...
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_69,"One day, when you become a real adult,"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_70,the time will come when you have to do something whether you like it or not.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_71,Use this well until that time comes.
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_72,"This is between you and me. You've never heard or saw me, okay?"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_73,...Okay!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_74,"Thank you so much, mister!!"
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_75,(Oh yeah... He asked me to keep this a secret...)
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_76,Reina?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_77,I’m sooooo curious about the story. Will you please tell me?
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_78,"Oh, ahahaha... Sorry! It’s been too long and I forgot what was behind this."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_79,Until next time then! Keep in touch!!
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_80,"Aww, I really wanted to hear the full story..."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_81,"Then again, I will let this pass as today is your birthday, Reina. fufufu."
E_C19_Nov_Reina01_82,I WILL hear it next time though... Fufufu!!
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_01,So many customers these days... It’s getting a little too hectic now. Not to mention that the inn is running low on ingredients too...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_02,"Hey, Juno."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_03,"Oh, hey Kirze. I feel like you're becoming a regular now."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_04,"As for the meal... The usual, I presume?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_05,Yes... Please.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_06,"Hehe, thank you for always enjoying my meal."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_07,Don't mention it. Your meals are all delicious.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_08,"Hmm, I noticed that there are a lot of people researching cooking nowadays."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_09,"Apparently, the current trend is monster food..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_10,"How about you, Juno? If you are interested in monster food, then-"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_11,"Oh... Um, haha... No thanks, I’m not really fond of monster food..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_12,"Actually, now that you are here, can I ask you a favor? Mind looking after the inn for me later?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_13,"Lately, there's been more customers than usual, so I need to get more ingredients."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_14,Me? But I've never served customers before...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_15,You’re gonna be fine. I’m going to place an absence sign on the door anyway. All you have to do is just look out for any suspicious people.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_16,"Hm... Well, if that's the case..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_17,"Great. I'll be back as soon as possible. Thank you again for doing this for me, Kirze."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_18,Okay.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_19,"Meanwhile, at May’s General Store..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_20,Hmm… today is Juno's birthday. What should I make for her?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_21,Maybe.. something just ordinary?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_22,"No! This time, I will make her the best food ever!"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_23,And I have all these fresh ingredients with me! I’m sure Juno will love this dish!
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_24,"Um... Yanne, we need to talk. Didn’t you see Juno’s face when she saw your monster food last time? I don't think she likes monster food."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_25,Nonsense. Nothing is more nutritious than monster food.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_26,"I'm gonna give my all today! For poor Juno, who hasn't had a proper break for months!"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_27,(I have a bad feeling about this... again.)
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_28,Good. I should strike the iron while it's hot! I’m gonna go cook right now!
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_29,"You're coming with me, May! Together, we're gonna make the best monster food for Juno!"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_30,Like I said-- Huhhh? W-wait up! Yanne! Yaaanne!
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_31,Juno... I’m here! Juno? Hmm?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_32,Oh... Um... Juno asked me to look after the inn for a while...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_33,"Oh, good to see you. I’m Yanne. Juno and I are real close friends."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_34,"So, she asked you to look after the inn, huh... Where did she go?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_35,"She said she's going to get some ingredients. She told me there has been a lot of customers lately, so she needs more supplies..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_36,Hmm...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_37,"You know, Juno’s been really busy lately."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_38,So I want to make a dish for Juno that will give her the stamina boost she needs. Not to mention that today is also her birthday. Do you mind if I use the kitchen?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_39,Birthday?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_40,Yep. Today is Juno's birthday. I’m gonna use all the cooking skills I've learned to make her the best food ever.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_41,You look like you are close with Juno too. Wanna join me?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_42,But I’ve never cooked before...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_43,That’s okay! I will give you all the instructions you need. Trust me.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_44,If you say so...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_45,"Awesome. Now, let’s prepare the ingredients..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_46,Hmm? Why are you making that face?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_47,Um... Aren’t these all monster parts?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_48,"Yep, I specially handpicked them myself. Nothing beats monster food when it comes to energy boost."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_49,But Juno told me that she doesn't like monster food...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_50,"Ah, my friend. You haven't heard about it either, eh? These are all full of nutrition and protein!"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_51,"Also, I’m going to make this dish look like an ordinary meat dish. So there's no way she'll know."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_52,"...If you cooperate, that is."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_53,Huh? I-uh...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_54,"You will cooperate, right?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_55,Uh... That’s...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_56,I know you will.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_57,Uh... Uh... I...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_58,This is for Juno.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_59,Ah... Ugh...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_60,(*Sigh...* I knew this would happen...)
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_61,"Phew! Sorry I took so long, Kirze! There were just too many things I had to- Oh, Yanne! You're here too?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_62,"Now, what is all this-"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_63,"Happy birthday, Juno! I know you've been real busy."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_64,That’s why we've prepared all these healthy food for you. We made all of this together.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_65,Three of you... Together?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_66,"Well, uh... Thank you for making all these birthday dishes for me. You didn't put anything weird in them, right?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_67,Like monster meat...?
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_68,Come on... I wouldn’t use ingredients you don't like.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_69,"Right, Kirze?"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_70,Huh? Um... Y-yeah...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_71,"Hm... Yeah, I shouldn’t doubt you girls. You made something special for me, after all."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_72,Thank you all for this! Time for a feast!
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_73,"Oh, right! What was I thinking? I have to meet someone really soon!"
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_74,I really have to go! So sorry about this! I’m gonna head off now! See you all later!
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_75,That’s weird. I’ve never seen Yanne in such a hurry.
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_76,"Hmm? Wait, this meat... I know this from somewhere..."
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_77,...
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_78,.......
E_C19_Nov_Juno01_79,(Yanne... You traitor!)
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_01,Father.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_02,"Me, came this far. So many things happened... So many trouble..."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_03,Demons... Many I kill. People... Many I protect.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_04,Father... I good? I good chief? Like you said?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_05,...She looks quite down today. Do you think she is homesick?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_06,Probably so. A long-time has passed since she left home.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_07,Being this far from home must’ve evoked the thought of home.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_08,"And not to mention, I happen to hear this awhile back, but..."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_09,Hm?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_10,I heard today is Nia’s birthday.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_11,What?! Of course you get depressed if you celebrate your birthday alone in a place so far from home!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_12,Maybe I should make her something delicious to cheer her up and celebrate her birthday.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_13,That sounds good. I can help you with that!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_14,......
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_15,"Hey, Nia."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_16,......
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_17,"Still feeling down, I see..."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_18,......
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_19,I...
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_20,You are...
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_21,"Father, great chief."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_22,"He told me, be great chief."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_23,I see... And?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_24,Am I... A great chief?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_25,Hmm... What do you think makes a great chief?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_26,Great chief... Protects many people. No matter what.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_27,"Also, great chief kills many Demons. Any Demon."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_28,Especially strong Demons. Must kill them. Chief strongest. Chief always fight first.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_29,But me... I’m not strong like father...
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_30,I can’t protect and kill like my father...
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_31,Am I... I don’t know... Would father think I a good chief?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_32,"Hmm... I don’t know what exactly your 'good' means,"
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_33,but I think you are doing really well.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_34,I’m sure your father would be proud of you.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_35,Really?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_36,Of course! Well... Um.. Yeah... So...
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_37,"Uhh... Oh, right. Close your eyes and reach out your hand for a bit."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_38,Huh? Okay.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_39,Wha?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_40,What is this?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_41,A present for the chieftain who’s doing a great job.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_42,"And a birthday present! It is your birthday today, chief."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_43,Yes... Present? I don’t have to give you money for this?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_44,That’s right! It’s a gift!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_45,Okay... Thank you...
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_46,You are not going to open it?
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_47,You should! You are going to like it.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_48,M-meat! Smell is the best I have ever had!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_49,Haha. I used my secret ingredient.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_50,We made you a lot. Eat them all and cheer up.
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_51,Thank you! Meat! Yummy!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_52,Yum! Very yummy!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_53,"Hey, Nia... We are not going to steal the food from you. So eat slow-"
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_54,*Cough!*
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_55,"Oh my, I knew that would happen."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_56,Don't just stand there! Help!
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_57,"Yes, my daughter. You were, and always will be my proud little daughter.\nYou already are a great chief."
E_C19_Nov_Nia01_58,But that’s not the important thing.\nAll I wish is that you live a happy life forever.
