E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_01,Full Blood Moon... Was it today?
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_02,"Tee hee,"
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_03,I feel like doing something extraordinary tonight!
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_04,(A few moments later)
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_05,"Lei... Ah, no, Lewisia. What's this about...?"
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_06,"Hm hm. Just call me Lei, Gau. No matter what, I am Lei, too."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_07,"O-okay. Then, I'll call you L-Lei like I used to do."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_08,Fine.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_09,"An invitation, Lewisia? What's this about? And we have a young Barbarian friend here."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_10,You sending an invitation. Now I have seen everything.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_11,"Phillop, Pavel. Glad to see you."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_12,(Dwarf King and Wizard of Ice Dragon...)
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_13,"Am I the last to arrive, Lewisia?"
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_14,"Welcome, Lorraine."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_15,(Sage of the Forest...)
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_16,"It's been a long time, Lewisia."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_17,It occurred to me on my way here that your birthday is around this time of year.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_18,Lei's Birthday...!
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_19,Yes. Today is the day that I can see the Blood Moon.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_20,I guess living among humans for so long is bringing out the human side of me.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_21,I suddenly felt the urge to receive well wishes for my birthday like other humans.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_22,"It's funny that you wanted to experience a human tradition,"
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_23,"but there is only one human here, this young one, among the people you invited. Hahaha!"
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_24,*Chuckle* Gau means something special to me.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_25,"When I was staying at the orphanage for a while, I saw Gau take good care of the kids on their birthdays."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_26,"I.. It's an honor for me, just to be with the heroes who saved the world."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_27,Hahaha... What a pure soul you are. I can sense the blessing of the Ice Elementals from you.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_28,Uh... Umm...
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_29,He is just a young boy who has a long way to go.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_30,Why don't we start the celebration now?
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_31,"Oh, right."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_32,"On behalf of the Elves and spirits of the Forest, congratulations to the ruler of pure red."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_33,"*Sigh* Lorraine, please keep the formal tone for formal events."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_34,You're making the mood all awkward.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_35,"Oh, I didn't mean it..."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_36,"Then, I'll keep it casual. Happy birthday, Lewisia. This is for you."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_37,It's a collection of dewdrops that contains the energy of young elementals. It will help with your Mana recovery.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_38,Hahaha. Lorraine thought the same thing that I did.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_39,"I thought a Mana Stone with pure Mana energy would be a good present for Lewisia, so I brought one."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_40,"Congrats, Lewisia. Take this."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_41,Congratulations. This is a snow crystal filled with Mana of Ice Dragons.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_42,I don't think I'll need to explain its value.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_43,"Ah... Umm... I couldn't prepare a gift, but happy birthday, Lei."
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_44,They knew me and when my birthday was because they're old friends.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_45,I did not invite you expecting a gift. There's no need for you to worry about it.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_46,I just wanted to celebrate like you humans do.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_47,But...
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_48,I'll remember your birthday and make sure to bring a nice gift for you on your next birthday!
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_49,*Chuckle* Sounds fair. Thank you for your kind words.
E_C19_Feb_Lewisia01_50,"Now, let's get started with the birthday party. Enjoy the night, and help yourself!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_01,Mirianne!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_02,Mirianne!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_03,Umm... Where did she go? 
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_04,(Bump!)
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_05,Mirianne?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_06,"Oops. Oh, Sonia!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_07,Why are you in such a rush?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_08,"Ah, Grandpa. Did you see Mirianne?"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_09,Mirianne?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_10,Umm... I have no idea.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_11,"Hmm... Okay. Thanks, Grandpa!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_12,"This isn't the type of thing I should to use my power for, but..."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_13,... (Buzz)
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_14,…
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_15,...Found it. The electric reaction from Mirianne's magical dagger...
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_16,It's this way.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_17,Umm? What is this bottle?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_18,!!!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_19,"*Cough, cough* What's this powder?"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_20,"I think I know what this might be... Eh, Mirianne must be pulling a prank on me."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_21,Let's go again...
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_22,Urgh...! (Buzz)
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_23,What is this powder? It's interrupting the signal detection!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_24,"Detection won't work, at least for a little while..."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_25,Umm? A note?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_26,She's lured!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_27,"Hahaha! It was worth the effort, collecting powder from Yanadis!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_28,"Now that she can't use detection, I wonder how she'll find me!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_29,"Mirianne... Playing hide-and-seek, all of a sudden? What are you thinking?"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_30,"Well, whatever."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_31,"You hide, I'll seek."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_32,"I can't use detection, so I should use another way."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_33,"Found you, Mirianne!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_34,...Ehhh? This quickly? How did you...?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_35,Have you forgotten?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_36,I have this ring on me!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_37,…
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_38,"Aww, that's cheating!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_39,There is no such thing as cheating in hide-and-seek.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_40,"I caught you, Mirianne. So I win, right?"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_41,...Haha.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_42,Nope! I won!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_43,Sonia! Happy birthday!
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_44,"Sonia, sweetheart, happy birthday! / Happy birthday, Sonia!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_45,...Eh?
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_46,"You were always out traveling around this time of year, so the kids didn't get to celebrate for your birthday."
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_47,They wanted to give you a big celebration this year.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_48,Mirianne did a good job distracting you while we were preparing.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_49,"Good work, Mirianne!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_50,"*Giggle* Thank you, Grandpa!"
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_51,Playing hide and seek with her was a lot of fun.
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_52,….
E_C19_Feb_Sonia01_53,...Thank you.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_01,Hmmm... A good day as usual.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_02,"Now, I wonder... What is this note that was stuck on the door?"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_03,"Hey, Mr. Dakaris, since we have nothing special going on today, why don’t you take a well-earned rest in the headquarters?"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_04,We're gonna go and see if we can find you a nice present!
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_05,Hohoho...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_06,A present? That sounds too grand.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_07,But then again... It feels rather pleasing to have my birthday be celebrated by someone.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_08,"Now now, I should relax and have some rest until they return..."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_09,Hmmm...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_10,Something feels lacking here.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_11,Ahahaha... You think... so?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_12,It looks enough to me...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_13,"Oh no, I’m not talking about the food."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_14,"Um, you know... It’s sincerity we are lacking... We should prepare a more sincere gift."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_15,You can eat a delicious meal anytime.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_16,"Besides, Mr. Dakaris himself already enjoys exploring the streets for delicacies."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_17,Remember when he went on a cuisine hunt last time?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_18,"Mmm, you're right."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_19,Oh wait! How about a book?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_20,He's always reading books. I’m pretty sure he’ll be overjoyed if we get him an interesting book.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_21,Hmm... We should then search for books he probably wouldn't have read yet.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_22,"Alrighty, we can leave the food here. They are all ready to serve."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_23,Let's go find that book!!
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_24,"Heyyy, wait for me!"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_25,Hmmm... Good... Very good.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_26,This bookshop has a unique... atmosphere...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_27,I’m sure we’ll find something interesting here.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_28,Hello!
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_29,Is anyone here?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_30,Hmm... Something's odd.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_31,I don't think there’s anyone here...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_32,But looking around should be fine... Right?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_33,"This place is creeping me out, but... Okay, I guess?"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_34,Let’s... try looking around...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_35,…
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_36,"Look, I managed to find some books."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_37,There’s this book and this book...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_38,Nice. I also found some books that seem challenging and mysterious.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_39,I wonder where we can pay for these books.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_40,…
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_41,Ahhhh!!! What the?!
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_42,Aieeee?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_43,???
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_44,Payment... Please...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_45,Ahahaha....
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_46,"Well, this is embarrassing..."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_47,I-indeed.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_48,The shopkeeper was really nice.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_49,But that was so sudden....
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_50,and I thought I was facing an Undead of some sort at first...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_51,"...Hahaha, I know right?! Glad I wasn’t the only one who was thinking that way."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_52,Phew...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_53,"That shopkeeper... He even made us a bed out of books in case we faint,"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_54,and also gave us a discount...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_55,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_56,Let’s keep this secret between us...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_57,...Of course.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_58,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_59,"Happy birthday, Mr. Dakaris!!"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_60,"Ohhhh, what a feast you've prepared."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_61,You have my utmost gratitude.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_62,Here! It's your birthday gift!
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_63,"To be honest, we don't know what this book is,"
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_64,but we found it in that bookstore two blocks down.
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_65,"Ah, I know that place."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_66,The owner of that store is a great man...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_67,"Although he is quite shy, always wearing that thick hood."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_68,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_69,Hmm? Did something happen?
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_70,"N-no, it’s nothing! Hahahaha..."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_71,Please! Dig in!
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_72,The food will get cold...
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_73,"Ah, yes."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_74,"Once again, you have my thanks for preparing such a feast."
E_C19_Feb_Dakaris01_75,But what fun is a feast without friends? Let us all enjoy this grand meal together.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_1,Kara!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_2,Guess what day today is!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_3,*Beep* 5th February.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_4,Examining existing data. Checking for updates.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_5,Today is the day for backing up Hanus' combat data as well as
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_6,updating my combat data. And...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_7,Correct!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_8,Hehe. Thank goodness Hanus is in Orvel.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_9,"Not a lot of people use firearms here in Orvel,"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_10,"so it's hard to find data appropriate for you, Kara."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_11,"Yes. Ever since Hanus has cooperated with us,"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_12,"the percentage of victory has increased to 20.14%, while the percentage of frame damage has gone down to 0.4%."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_13,So today...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_14,"So once we get the data, you'll have Orvel conquered in no time!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_15,"No, Master. Today is..."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_16,"Great! Let's go, Kara!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_17,This is going to get us a ton of research funds for this month! Yipee!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_18,...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_19,Whaaaaat?!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_20,No way! Hanus isn't here?!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_21,But I've made appointments for every 5th!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_22,Haha... But I don't think today is going to work.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_23,Hanus' father just contacted us.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_24,"She told him how she really wanted to go back to the field for her birthday this year,"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_25,but she was totally shot down.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_26,What? Oh no...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_27,Huh? Wait!! Today is Hanus' birthday?!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_28,"I've tried to tell you numerous times, Master."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_29,But you entered into a state of excitement at the thought of updating and did not listen.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_30,It looked like Hanus was getting some things ready as well. It's too bad.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_31,"I'm sorry, but could you stop by again some other day?"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_32,Mmm... I guess there isn't anything we can do...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_33,"...Wait, wait!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_34,"So you're saying you don't know where Hanus is right now, right?"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_35,Yes. But she did say she'd be back before it was too late.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_36,"Okay! Thanks, Veronica!!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_37,"Come on, Kara!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_38,Master. This is the way to the research lab.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_39,Yeap!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_40,It's Hanus' birthday! We can't just sit by and let it pass.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_41,Let's make a weapon for Hanus! Yeah?
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_42,"But based on the combat data we have backed up on her,"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_43,the weapons she uses require detailed adjustment and inspection.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_44,There are about 13 hours left until midnight.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_45,I'm not certain we could manage to finish before then.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_46,"No, no. We can do it!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_47,Because... Hehehe...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_48,"You're here, Kara!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_49,...?
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_50,*Sigh* I'm sick of being treated like a child.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_51,I was treated with respect back there!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_52,"Unlike father, they acknowledged my abilities..."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_53,I had people who liked me... who liked my performances...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_54,......
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_55,*Beep* Confirming location. Moving now.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_56,There you are! Hanus!!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_57,Huh? This voice...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_58,(Oh!! I was supposed to meet Annette today!)
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_59,"Uh, Annette. What brings you here today?"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_60,"You, of course!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_61,"We collected records of the routes and locations you frequently go,"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_62,and successfully located you before midnight.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_63,"Hmm. Now, now..."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_64,"Let's start, Kara!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_65,(Start what?!)
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_66,Target confirmed.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_67,Wh-what are you—
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_68,Happy birthday!!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_69,"Happy birthday, Hanus."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_70,Huh...?
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_71,...This is...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_72,Hehe. It's your new weapon!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_73,We made it using your records left on Kara.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_74,98.7% match to backed-up combat data.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_75,"According to my calculations, the weapon is ready for immediate use."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_76,...But I... I forgot about our appointment...
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_77,"Oh, that's okay! Stuff like that happens!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_78,You help us all the time! Don't sweat about missing one day!
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_79,Percentage of victory increased since backing up of Hanus' combat data.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_80,Level of progress in Master's research increased. Percentage of frame damage reduced.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_81,Your skills are effective in breaking records.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_82,Tha...Thank you. Happy birthday.
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_83,......
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_84,(I...)
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_85,"Ehem. A true soldier should, of course, be capable of what I do."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_86,"...Very well. Since my return has been postponed,"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_87,"I will continue to help you with your research, Annette."
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_88,"Yay! Thanks, Hanus!"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_89,(...How could I forget? There are people who like me here as well...)
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_90,(...I won't lie. I still want to go back to the army...)
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_91,"(But with them, I want to... stay here a little longer...)"
E_C20_Feb_Hanus01_92,"(Thanks, Annette! Thanks, Kara!)"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_01,......
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_02,"What's wrong, Zafir? Something bothering you?"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_03,"I don't know if you could say I was bothered, but..."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_04,I'm just not sure if it's really okay that we don't do... anything.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_05,"Oh, you mean the God King's birthday."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_06,"Yes. I know he said he wanted to let it pass quietly, but still..."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_07,"Hmm... Yes, it really is a tough call to make."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_08,Does it mean that we do a less fancy job celebrating it or do something really small?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_09,"Or does it mean that we shouldn't do anything altogether, other than wishing him happy birthday?"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_10,"You could ask me next year, and I still wouldn't have an answer."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_11,"Haha. So you've been thinking about it, too."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_12,What should we do?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_13,Should we ask Laias about it?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_14,"It is an important issue, but are you sure it's okay to ask Laias these kinds of things?"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_15,"Well, we could talk about this all day, but we're never going to come to an answer."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_16,...That's true...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_17,"Welcome, Laudia! Is that you, Zafir? It's been a while."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_18,"Yes, it's been a while."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_19,We wanted to ask you something.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_20,Now what would that be?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_21,Well...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_22,Hmm. I see how that could be confusing.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_23,I think the last option would be the closest to what His Majesty actually meant.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_24,The kind where he can be left alone in peace.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_25,Is that so...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_26,But would that really be okay?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_27,He's going to say that it's okay— that it's exactly what he wants...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_28,But I doubt you two would like to let him spend the day like that.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_29,"Is that how you feel, too?"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_30,I think it should be okay as long as we don't do anything too fancy.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_31,We could get by with some birthday greetings and a small gift.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_32,"Right. Then we'll do just that. Thank you, Laias."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_33,"Now, what could we possibly present as a small gift to a man who's had everything in the world...?"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_34,How's this?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_35,......
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_36,Your Majesty.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_37,"This isn't much, but..."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_38,...I can't help but remember.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_39,"After sending me gifts every year even from studying abroad,"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_40,you came back with a handful of things.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_41,No. It does not do to dwell on the past.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_42,What is going on out there?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_43,"W-we're sorry to disturb you, Your Majesty."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_44,We heard you wished to be left in peace...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_45,But found it too great of a pity to let it pass so quietly and decided to come for a visit.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_46,Have we gone too far?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_47,......
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_48,...It's fine. Come in.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_49,What was the commotion just now?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_50,"Uh, that was..."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_51,Hoabis... Didn't I tell you not to...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_52,"We had something prepared for you the way people celebrate birthdays nowadays,"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_53,but Hoabis got a little interested and kept standing in front of Zafir's foot...
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_54,Hmm? What is it?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_55,"Your Majesty, we wish you a very happy birthday. This isn't much, but..."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_56,Hmm. I've never seen such a dish in the desert.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_57,"Apparently far off in Orvel or the Empire,"
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_58,they celebrate birthdays by eating this dish called 'cake.'
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_59,We thought it would be good to have you try it since it's not something that can be found around here.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_60,I see... Did you make this?
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_61,Not exactly. I had Laudia and Zafir help me.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_62,You could say all three of us made it together.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_63,...This is indeed small and simple.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_64,But I do thank you. Now I wish to be left alone to rest.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_65,"Yes, Your Majesty. Happy birthday."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_66,"Your Majesty, I hope you have a very happy birthday."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_67,Time goes by and keeps making way for new things.
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_68,"As much as the past is not something that can be forgotten, it is also foolish to get tied down by it."
E_C20_Feb_Kain01_69,"This may seem small, but it's enough to turn my head facing forward."
