CS_CHE_H1_1_001,May~!! Let's play!!
CS_CHE_H1_1_002,Carrot candy! Do you have any Carrot candy?!
CS_CHE_H1_1_003,"Carrot Candy? I've never heard of that...well, I do have chocolate, though?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_004,Chocolate is good too!
CS_CHE_H1_1_005,"Nom nom...eh, who's that tall lady over there? Never seen her before!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_006,"Ah, you mean Yanne?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_007,"She's amazing, you know! She even has the title of a 'Dragon Slayer'!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_008,"There used to be this evil, scary dragon called Svelta the Mad a few years ago. She slew that dragon alone, without any help!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_009,"Mad? What, was he always angry?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_010,"Some dragons get corrupted and go crazy. They wreak havoc instead of guarding the world, as they should."
CS_CHE_H1_1_011,"May, I put the requested Dragon Scales, Hide and other materials outside."
CS_CHE_H1_1_012,Thank you~hehe.
CS_CHE_H1_1_013,"Dragons are those huge fat lizards, right? Wow! You're really strong, tall sis!!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_014,"Just don't let the blacksmith across the road catch you saying that, ok?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_015,"Hehe, Jin is a nice person, so it should be fine."
CS_CHE_H1_1_016,"By the way, May! Something feels different! The shop, and your clothes too!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_017,"Oh, there were a lot of costume requests due to the Halloween festival tonight."
CS_CHE_H1_1_018,"So, I gave it my all!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_019,"With that level of skill, you wouldn't have to continue this general store business. You'd make it big as a famous tailor, no doubt."
CS_CHE_H1_1_020,"Ahaha, well, making clothes is more of a hobby."
CS_CHE_H1_1_021,"Wow, so cute!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_022,I want one! Anything for me?
CS_CHE_H1_1_023,"Ah, there should be several outfits just your size. Do you want to try some on?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_024,Yes! Gimme gimme!
CS_CHE_H1_1_025,"Ok~ Just wait a sec, I'll bring a few costumes!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_027,Aaaaaah!
CS_CHE_H1_1_028,May!! Did something happen?!
CS_CHE_H1_1_030,"...No answer. Can't be helped, let's go in."
CS_CHE_H1_1_031,Eh? I can't see!!
CS_CHE_H1_1_032,"..The power of darkness? No, it's a bit different..."
CS_CHE_H1_1_034,"Tall sis, this is..."
CS_CHE_H1_1_035,"...Yeah, seems like it."
CS_CHE_H1_1_036,We're faaaaaaalllllllliiiiiiiiiiiing--!!!
CS_CHE_H1_2_001,....Ugh...where are we..?
CS_CHE_H1_2_002,"Uuuu, it hurts...I hit my head!"
CS_CHE_H1_2_003,But where's May...ah!
CS_CHE_H1_2_004,"She's only unconscious. Thankfully, she isn't hurt."
CS_CHE_H1_2_005,May! No sleeping outdoors! You'll catch a cold!
CS_CHE_H1_2_006,Ugh....ummm....huh? Yanne...? Luna...?
CS_CHE_H1_2_007,Where is this? I was looking for my costumes...
CS_CHE_H1_2_008,"I was rummaging through the wardrobes, but about six were missing, so..."
CS_CHE_H1_2_009,"Wait, we'll talk later. I feel something...ominous."
CS_CHE_H1_3_001,Weird. These pumpkin-covered monsters...they aren't normal undead.
CS_CHE_H1_3_002,They feel very different from the undead usually seen in our world..
CS_CHE_H1_3_003,"Tall sis, they're still the bad guys, right? I can hit them, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_3_004,"Still, they have cute heads!"
CS_CHE_H1_3_005,Let's take them off and display them at May's shop!
CS_CHE_H1_3_006,"Ahaha, I already have plenty of pumpkin themed accessories back at the shop, so..."
CS_CHE_H1_3_007,"They may be different, but they're still hostile. We're breaking through."
CS_CHE_H1_4_001,"Shh, stop for a sec. That's..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_002,...What's that?
CS_CHE_H1_4_003,"I don't know...but they look like evil spirits. They probably took the form of people from our world, though..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_004,"There's one that stands out, too!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_006,Eh? What is it?
CS_CHE_H1_4_007,Ahahaha...um...that's one of the missing costumes I was looking for back at the shop.
CS_CHE_H1_4_008,"Hm, themed after the mummies back at Aegina Desert, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_009,She's only wearing bandages! Is she hurt?
CS_CHE_H1_4_010,Ahahaha...
CS_CHE_H1_4_011,"Still, I don't understand. Who is that, and why is she wearing my costume...?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_012,"She does feel similar to the other evil spirits, but..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_013,"She's still a bad guy, right? A baddie thief that stole May's costume!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_014,I'm gonna get it back!!
CS_CHE_H1_4_015,Luna! It's dangerous to go alone!
CS_CHE_H1_4_016,???
CS_CHE_H1_4_017,Don't rush things!
CS_CHE_H1_4_018,...Did Luna's attack just not work?
CS_CHE_H1_4_019,"May's attack worked, though...uuu...."
CS_CHE_H1_4_020,...I definitely felt some kind of aura spark between the costumes...
CS_CHE_H1_4_021,Eh? You mean the ones May made?
CS_CHE_H1_4_022,Yes. I guess something is going on with the costumes here.
CS_CHE_H1_4_024,"May, do you have any other costumes on hand?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_025,"Ah, yes...they're mostly the ones I was going to show Luna...and..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_026,"...a few others, hehehe..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_027,....?
CS_CHE_H1_4_028,"Well, let's see."
CS_CHE_H1_4_029,Cute! Very cute! I love it!
CS_CHE_H1_4_030,"Ahaha, thanks, Luna! You're too cute~"
CS_CHE_H1_4_032,"....So, this is the only thing that fits me, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_033,Haha...this is a bit embarassing.
CS_CHE_H1_4_034,"Ahaha, it is kind of...breezy, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_035,"...B, but it looks really good!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_036,"Bunny ears, bunny ears!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_037,You look like a grown up Luna!
CS_CHE_H1_4_038,"...Haha, well, can't be helped."
CS_CHE_H1_4_039,"Anyway, I have a hunch. To defeat the costume-wearing evil spirits..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_040,we need to be wearing May-made costumes ourselves.
CS_CHE_H1_4_041,"Now then, carefully..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_042,Chaaaaaaargeeeee!!!!
CS_CHE_H1_4_043,"...Hahahaha, she's funny."
CS_CHE_H1_4_044,"Ah, hell with it. Hey~wait for me!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_045,"Ah! Luna, I already said it's dangerous to go alone!"
CS_CHE_H1_5_001,"That makes three! Three more to go, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_5_002,"Yeah, we're halfway there!"
CS_CHE_H1_5_003,"I still don't know why my clothes have this kind of power, though."
CS_CHE_H1_5_004,The evil spirits turned into orbs of light and disappeared! The other monsters went with them too! Weird~
CS_CHE_H1_5_005,It's definitely an interesting phenomenon. Evil spirits usually don't just get purified this easily...
CS_CHE_H1_5_006,"Well, that's not important. Right now, let's focus on getting back May's costumes and finding a way out."
CS_CHE_H1_5_007,"It seems to be a given that there are a lot of evil spirits converging around those with costumes, though."
CS_CHE_H1_5_008,"Let's try...that way, next."
CS_CHE_H1_6_001,"So this is the last group of monsters, correct?"
CS_CHE_H1_6_002,"We found 5 costumes so far, so yeah, this should be the last!"
CS_CHE_H1_6_003,Already? I want to blast a few more pumpkins!
CS_CHE_H1_6_004,It's kind of worriying that we still have no clues to how to get back...
CS_CHE_H1_6_005,"But well, let's first find that last costume."
CS_CHE_H1_7_001,...? That is...
CS_CHE_H1_7_002,"Wait, this is odd. May, that is one of your costumes, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_003,"Hm? Ah, yes! That's actually one of the first I made!"
CS_CHE_H1_7_004,...Feels off...doesn't look like an evil spirit.
CS_CHE_H1_7_005,"Hm, that should be because I am no evil spirit. I am but a mere magus."
CS_CHE_H1_7_006,...!!
CS_CHE_H1_7_007,"Hahaha, no need to worry."
CS_CHE_H1_7_008,"Good to see you, May. I am sorry to get you involved with my mistakes."
CS_CHE_H1_7_009,"...Mr. Nyx? Mr. Nyx, is that you? Phew, and I thought an evil spirit had taken your shape, like those others..."
CS_CHE_H1_7_010,"Haha, I don't blame you for thinking so."
CS_CHE_H1_7_011,"Thank you for those costumes, by the way. They were just as I had asked for."
CS_CHE_H1_7_012,You did an amazing job.
CS_CHE_H1_7_013,Costumes?
CS_CHE_H1_7_014,"Ah, actually, Mr. Nyx is a travelling magus who pops in every once in a while."
CS_CHE_H1_7_015,"He put in a request for a lot of costumes for the Halloween event, because of some experiment or something."
CS_CHE_H1_7_016,"He gave me a lot of high-quality materials and thread, and aside from a few specially requested designs, let me make whatever I want."
CS_CHE_H1_7_017,So the costumes we saw so far...
CS_CHE_H1_7_018,were made with whatever materials he gave you?
CS_CHE_H1_7_019,"That is so. Unfortunately, I needed some of the costumes urgently, so I was thinking of taking a few back with me early."
CS_CHE_H1_7_020,"However, due to unforseen events, I involved you all into this mess."
CS_CHE_H1_7_021,I'm sorry for startling you all.
CS_CHE_H1_7_022,"Well, you paid me beforehand and also let me keep the leftover material for my own projects, so it's fine if you wanted to take some ahead of schedule..."
CS_CHE_H1_7_023,But what exactly is going on...?
CS_CHE_H1_7_024,"Hmm, sadly, I cannot explain right now."
CS_CHE_H1_7_025,"First, you must defeat me."
CS_CHE_H1_7_026,"Wait, what?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_027,"Due to a mixup in the experiment, my body isn't fully under my control."
CS_CHE_H1_7_028,Evil spirit?
CS_CHE_H1_7_029,"Yes, you are correct. I have been suppressing the spirit stuck to this costume, but without help, I cannot get rid of it."
CS_CHE_H1_7_030,Hmm...by the way.
CS_CHE_H1_7_031,"At any rate, you're the one who got us all in danger, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_032,"...Yes, it is so. Once again, I am sor -"
CS_CHE_H1_7_033,Can it. You can apologize after I get a few punches in.
CS_CHE_H1_7_034,..Is tall sis angry?
CS_CHE_H1_7_035,Ahaha....
CS_CHE_H1_8_001,"Enough, enough. The evil spirit has been purified, so put down that arrow. I'll die, you know."
CS_CHE_H1_8_002,"...Tch, you didn't even get hit properly one time."
CS_CHE_H1_8_003,"Hahaha...well, if I do get hit properly, I wouldn't be able to apologize properly."
CS_CHE_H1_8_004,"Isn't that so? The last female warrior of the Barbarian race, Dragon Slayer Yanne."
CS_CHE_H1_8_005,...Hmph. Fine.
CS_CHE_H1_8_006,The evil spirit is gone. Time for you to tell us how to get back to our world.
CS_CHE_H1_8_007,"Hm? If it's returning you want to do, I can help you anytime. This is a world I created with my magic, after all."
CS_CHE_H1_8_008,"Well, it's only possible because you helped me get rid of that evil spirit. Please put down that arrow."
CS_CHE_H1_8_009,"I created a portal behind myself, so if you wish to return, just walk through it."
CS_CHE_H1_8_010,Wait! I have a question!
CS_CHE_H1_8_011,"What kind of experiment were you doing, Mr. Odd Eyes?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_012,"...Haha, you're quite the curious one, little miss."
CS_CHE_H1_8_013,"Hm. You must know that Halloween has its roots in remembering those who have passed on, no?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_014,"Some evil spirits, instead of passing on, remain to harm people throughout the festival."
CS_CHE_H1_8_015,"So, I was thinking of creating a festival for only evil spirits, where no humans would be put at risk."
CS_CHE_H1_8_016,"The experiment was initially a failure, but thanks to you all, I managed to clean up the mess."
CS_CHE_H1_8_017,Eh? So all this was just a really fun party for evil spirits?
CS_CHE_H1_8_018,"Yes, that is so."
CS_CHE_H1_8_019,One more question! What did May's costumes have to do with all this?
CS_CHE_H1_8_020,"Oh, that was part of the things the evil spirits wanted to do for the festival."
CS_CHE_H1_8_021,Some wanted to merely fight. Some wanted nice things to eat. Others wished for beautiful clothing.
CS_CHE_H1_8_022,"In the end, I requested special costumes with a Halloween vibe that would help fulfill their final wishes."
CS_CHE_H1_8_023,"Considering it made it into this world, I suppose your costume also fits the taste of a certain evil spirit, Yanne."
CS_CHE_H1_8_026,....Hmm? Maybe I guessed wrong. Was that one of the costumes made from the remaining material...
CS_CHE_H1_8_027,Aha..ahahaha...Nooooooo!!
CS_CHE_H1_8_028,"....Well, she did say making clothes was her hobby."
CS_CHE_H1_8_029,I guess she is interested in...a wide variety of designs.
CS_CHE_H1_8_030,How adventurous.
CS_CHE_H1_8_031,"Eh? Wait, but why did we have to wear May's costumes to defeat those costume-wearing spirits?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_032,Hm? I never invoked such magic.
CS_CHE_H1_8_033,"Haha, well, perhaps the evil spirits had a strong desire to play with those who were also dressing up, while refusing to play with those without the Halloween spirit."
CS_CHE_H1_8_034,"Wow, and I thought I was the only one having fun! So...they were enjoying the fact that I was dunking their faces in carrots?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_035,"Hehe, hopefully they all pass on peacefully to carrot heaven."
CS_CCE_C1_1_001,"Hmm? My, if it isn't the lady of the Daphnel family. What brings you here?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_002,CONVERSATION_SURPRISE
CS_CCE_C1_1_003,...The Queen of Penthe...!
CS_CCE_C1_1_004,"Shh. I kept my identity a secret all this way to Orvelia, the Kingdom of Heroes."
CS_CCE_C1_1_005,No need for the formalities in such a public area.
CS_CCE_C1_1_006,"Hmm, how about this."
CS_CCE_C1_1_007,...?
CS_CCE_C1_1_008,"For the day, you will be my friend."
CS_CCE_C1_1_009,"Let us redo our greetings, then."
CS_CCE_C1_1_010,"Hello, Aisha. What a beautiful morning it is."
CS_CCE_C1_1_011,CONVERSATION_SILENCE
CS_CCE_C1_1_012,"Ahem. Y...yes, Artemia. Good...morning."
CS_CCE_C1_1_013,"I don't think I have seen you around lately, ever since that party at the palace."
CS_CCE_C1_1_014,What brings you to Orvelia?
CS_CCE_C1_1_015,"Hmm, Christmas...was it? I'm not too sure what it's meant to celebrate."
CS_CCE_C1_1_016,"Still, I heard it was a day of meaningful festivities, and thus I have come to experience them first-hand."
CS_CCE_C1_1_017,"This year's festival was named...'The Secret Santa Festival', I assume?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_018,"Ah, yes. This year's festival is a bit different from the others before it."
CS_CCE_C1_1_019,The staff are setting up artificial monsters the town. These monsters drop certain coins when caught...
CS_CCE_C1_1_020,and the participants can exchange those coins for presents to give to the children of the city.
CS_CCE_C1_1_021,"Hmm, so why are you, the daughter of an esteemed noble family, participating in such an event?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_022,Noblesse Oblige. It is the duty of us nobles to do right for the people.
CS_CCE_C1_1_023,"Disregarding birth and blood, children are the future of the country. It is a given that we nobles take care of them, and bring them happiness."
CS_CCE_C1_1_024,As expected from the Daphnel family.
CS_CCE_C1_1_025,"I am curious, though - is your maid not with you today?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_026,"Priscilla had to take care of some other business, so she couldn't come."
CS_CCE_C1_1_027,I'll need someone else to fill in for the Rudolph position...
CS_CCE_C1_1_028,The event doesn't start until a few hours later...so I'll have to find someone to stand in.
CS_CCE_C1_1_029,"Rudolph? Ah, the red-nosed reindeer?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_030,"Yes, participants need to be in a team of at least one Santa and one Rudoph to take part."
CS_CCE_C1_1_031,"Of course, it doesn't matter if there are more than one Santa or Rudolph in a team."
CS_CCE_C1_1_032,"Hmm, I thought I didn't need an escort today, so I came alone..."
CS_CCE_C1_1_033,"A cute reindeer...hmm, what about that person over there?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_034,CONVERSATION_SURPRISE
CS_CCE_C1_1_035,"Let's go, before someone else takes him!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_001,"Hmm..that way? I see, that way!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_002,Looks like he's going somewhere in a busy fashion. I wonder why?
CS_CCE_C1_2_003,"I don't know, but it seems he's in a hurry."
CS_CCE_C1_2_004,"Still, I see the monsters have been released already even though the festival hasn't begun."
CS_CCE_C1_2_005,We need a Rudolph fast...
CS_CCE_C1_2_006,"I found you, Fake Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_007,CONVERSATION_SURPRISE
CS_CCE_C1_2_008,Eh? Fake Santa? How rude!
CS_CCE_C1_2_009,See? I even have my Rudolph right here!
CS_CCE_C1_2_010,That's a fake! Objects don't count!!
CS_CCE_C1_2_011,"Also, the goal of this event is to give presents to the good kids!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_012,You just want to steal all the snacks the people put out for Santa!
CS_CCE_C1_2_013,"Eh? What do you take me for, a mere snack thief?"
CS_CCE_C1_2_014,I am the Great Miruru! I wouldn't stoop so low!
CS_CCE_C1_2_015,Lies! The Spirits told me everything!
CS_CCE_C1_2_016,"When you were changing back at May's,"
CS_CCE_C1_2_017,you were reciting your plan to yourself and laughing 'wahahaha'!!
CS_CCE_C1_2_018,"Tch, busted...wait, were you spying on me changing?!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_019,What are you saying? Spirits are everywhere in the world.
CS_CCE_C1_2_020,Aaaargh!! What's done is done!!
CS_CCE_C1_2_021,"I'll turn you into Roast Rudolph for the sake of my sna...no, for the prosperity of the Miruru Pirates!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_022,"Hmph, it surprises me to see such a bad Santa."
CS_CCE_C1_2_023,"I cannot let this happen. The Secret Santa Festival exists to bring happiness to the children,"
CS_CCE_C1_2_024,"not for some crook to steal all the food. For that, punishment is due."
CS_CCE_C1_2_025,"So, little Rudoph. Let us help you with this situation. Instead..."
CS_CCE_C1_2_026,"Hm? Oh, you want me to become your Rudolph?"
CS_CCE_C1_2_027,"OK! If you help me with my work, I'll help you too!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_028,There's no rule saying that the Staff cannot participate in a team!
CS_CCE_C1_2_029,"Good, that speeds things up."
CS_CCE_C1_2_030,"Now, let us kick out this rude little Santa."
CS_CCE_C1_3_001,"Out with you, Thief Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_002,Noooooo!! My snaaaaaacks~~!!
CS_CCE_C1_3_003,"Hmm, I do feel a bit bad. She was just a child..."
CS_CCE_C1_3_004,"It's fine! Her soul's age is like t...Eh? Oh, so I shouldn't say that?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_005,Ok! I won't talk about a woman's age!
CS_CCE_C1_3_006,"I have no idea what kind of magic you're using, but you must be very talented....um..."
CS_CCE_C1_3_007,Er...Mr. Reindeer.
CS_CCE_C1_3_008,"Oh, my name is Rephy! I'm a Tamian Guide!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_009,"Nice to meet you, Artemia, Aisha!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_010,"The Tamia...if I'm correct, that is a rare race that lives in the Elidora Forest..."
CS_CCE_C1_3_011,"Wait, I don't think we introduced ourselves yet...?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_012,"Ah, the Spirits told me all about you!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_013,"My usual job is to guide wandering spirits towards the Otherworld,"
CS_CCE_C1_3_014,"but sometimes they don't leave and just stick to places, usually around me!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_015,They tell me all sorts of things!
CS_CCE_C1_3_016,Aren't those kinds of spirits usually vengeful spirits or evil ghosts...?
CS_CCE_C1_3_017,"Eh? No, these children are very nice!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_018,"They can be mischievous, but they don't hurt people!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_019,"I...I see. Good to meet you, Rephy."
CS_CCE_C1_3_020,"Why are you, a member of the staff, in such a rush to find people like that child, though?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_021,Oh? That? There are some people that aren't taking this event seriously enough!
CS_CCE_C1_3_022,"The Spirits told me of a Thief Santa, a Prankster Santa and a Drunk Santa!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_023,I have to scold them and stop them from ruining the event!
CS_CCE_C1_3_024,"Hmm, I see."
CS_CCE_C1_3_025,"Well, I have no wish to see the first event I participated in fall into ruin,"
CS_CCE_C1_3_026,"so I - no, we'll help you."
CS_CCE_C1_3_027,"In exchange, I hope you'll help us with the main festival, Rephy."
CS_CCE_C1_3_028,Thanks! I'm in your care!
CS_CCE_C1_4_001,"Now then, time to catch Prankster Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_002,A Prankster...what kind of pranks does this Santa plan to pull?
CS_CCE_C1_4_003,"Eh? Ah, this Santa wants to sneak into people's beds and play pranks on them while they sleep!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_004,CONVERSATION_SURPRISE
CS_CCE_C1_4_005,"I dunno what these pranks are, but people might be startled! So I can't allow this!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_006,"I mean, last Halloween was free of evil spirits and their evil pranks! And that was a relief for everyone!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_007,Belated pranks can wait till the next Halloween!
CS_CCE_C1_5_001,"Found you, Prankster Santa! No, Weird Demon!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_002,Hm?! A Demon?!
CS_CCE_C1_5_003,"My, what a cute little reindeer. Still, calling me a Prankster...and hey, I'm not weird at all!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_004,I'm the kindest and least harmful Demon of them all!
CS_CCE_C1_5_005,But you're still going to sneak in people's beds and surprise them!
CS_CCE_C1_5_006,"The Spirits heard you talk about this to some girl in a coffin! You know, the one who can't live or die!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_007,Eh? How did you...
CS_CCE_C1_5_008,Vile Demon...
CS_CCE_C1_5_009,"Not only did you bring an Undead to this city,"
CS_CCE_C1_5_010,but you also now try to sneak into people's houses and harm the innocent?!
CS_CCE_C1_5_011,"As I thought, Demons cannot be trusted."
CS_CCE_C1_5_012,"My ancestors paid with their blood to keep the Demons at bay,"
CS_CCE_C1_5_013,and yet you still attempt to harm innocent civilians...!!
CS_CCE_C1_5_014,"W...wait, you got it all wrong."
CS_CCE_C1_5_015,"I'm just trying to find people who will have nightmares, and swap those scary dreams for good and pleasant dreams!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_016,Eh? You weren't just going to play pranks?
CS_CCE_C1_5_017,"No! C'mon, I don't even have a Rudolph, so I can't participate normally."
CS_CCE_C1_5_018,"I just wanted to give presents to people in the way I'm best at, considering I'm a type of Dream Demon..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_019,Eh...if that's the case...
CS_CCE_C1_5_020,"Don't be fooled, Rephy. She's just playing you with her words."
CS_CCE_C1_5_021,"That's what Demons do best, after all. Fooling people with sweet words..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_022,"Well, I wouldn't deny that, at least in the case of Malduk and Angmund, but I..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_023,"Die, Demon!"
CS_CCE_C1_6_001,How unfaaaaaaair!
CS_CCE_C1_6_002,"Well, if she was just trying to stop people from having nightmares..."
CS_CCE_C1_6_003,"Perhaps what she was trying to do was noble, but her methods..."
CS_CCE_C1_6_004,"Right, people's lives could have been sucked dry..."
CS_CCE_C1_6_005,Eh? Why would good dreams make people dry up?
CS_CCE_C1_6_006,CONVERSATION_SILENCE
CS_CCE_C1_6_007,"Well, at least it wasn't a prank!"
CS_CCE_C1_6_008,Next...let's go get Drunk Santa!!
CS_CCE_C1_7_001,"Hohoho...*hic*! Ah, I haven't had a good drink in so long..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_002,"That huge barbarian keeled over a long time ago, what a pushover...hahaha..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_003,"Anyway, these clothes are really warm."
CS_CCE_C1_7_004,I feel like I could just dig into the earth and go into hibernation wearing them....zzzzz....
CS_CCE_C1_7_005,"Found you, Drunk Santa!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_006,"Yikes, you surprised me!!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_007,"I'm not drunk, anyway. I'm still sober!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_008,"I mean, I haven't drunk this much in a while, but still...*hic*"
CS_CCE_C1_7_009,"Ugh, you reek of alcohol!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_010,What would the kids think! Go home and sleep it off already!
CS_CCE_C1_7_011,"You don't have a Rudolph, so even if you look exactly like the Saint from the books, you can't participate!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_012,"Come to think of it, he really does look like the Saint."
CS_CCE_C1_7_013,"Aside from his height and size, anyway."
CS_CCE_C1_7_014,The Saint in Red...who was that?
CS_CCE_C1_7_015,"The books say he was a man who loved people more than anyone,"
CS_CCE_C1_7_016,but hated Demons and 'Evil' more than anyone else.
CS_CCE_C1_7_017,Some people think his clothes were red because they were stained in the blood of countless Demons.
CS_CCE_C1_7_018,"...That sounds more like a Hero, rather than a Saint."
CS_CCE_C1_7_019,"100 years ago, when my ancestors were fighting against the Demons,"
CS_CCE_C1_7_020,perhaps the war would have gone better if we had more pople like him...
CS_CCE_C1_7_021,"Ah, you mean that guy?"
CS_CCE_C1_7_022,I did think these clothes looked like the ones Nicholas wore back in those days.
CS_CCE_C1_7_023,"Haha, the Slaughterer of Demons, the odd human from the Order of Lua, hailed as a Saint...what a funny joke, ahahaha..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_024,"Then there was Rudolph, eh? That gigantic reindeer that was as ripped as an ogre..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_025,"If I remember correctly, that reindeer didn't eat grass, but it ate Demons..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_026,CONVERSATION_SILENCE
CS_CCE_C1_7_027,I don't care!
CS_CCE_C1_7_028,"First, I'm going to have you go back to the Inn and sleep!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_001,Zzzzz....
CS_CCE_C1_8_002,"*pant pant*...How strong is this drunk Gramps, anyway?!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_003,All those times he tried to accurately headbutt me...is this some kind of legendary Drunken Martial Arts?!
CS_CCE_C1_8_004,A Dwarf that knows of the Saint from 100 years ago...
CS_CCE_C1_8_005,"It couldn't be...the King of Dwarves, one of the Hero's companions...?"
CS_CCE_C1_8_006,"...Most likely not. Dwarves all live far over 100 years, and the King wasn't the only one fighting a long ago..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_007,"Well, we can't just leave Gramps sleeping out in the snow!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_008,I'll take him to the Inn!
CS_CCE_C1_8_009,"Help me, Spirits!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_010,...What a day.
CS_CCE_C1_8_011,"A lot happened, but we got our Rudolph."
CS_CCE_C1_8_012,"Now, we can participate in the event properly."
CS_CCE_C1_8_013,Hopefully no other weird incidents happen.
CS_CCE_C1_8_014,"Ah, I hear fireworks from afar. Perhaps the festival has begun."
CS_CCE_C1_8_015,"We just need to wait for Rephy, and then..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_016,"*pant, pant*...I'm back! The event just started too, so I'll be a good Rudolph!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_017,"Also, I'm sorry to say..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_018,There is a Santa-Rudolph duo hoarding the monster drops just as the festival began...
CS_CCE_C1_8_019,"Hmm, they sound very capable."
CS_CCE_C1_8_020,"Yeah, they're catching all the monsters at a scary pace!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_021,"Although, I'm worried this might not leave much for the other Santas..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_022,"I see, then we have 2 options."
CS_CCE_C1_8_023,"First, we can go and stop the hoarders from getting everything,"
CS_CCE_C1_8_024,"or second, we can just go our way and try to catch some monsters on ourselves."
CS_CCE_C1_8_025,"Since those two aren't really breaking any rules, it's difficult..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_026,"still, this isn't a tournament, it's a festival. People should have fun together!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_027,"Still, no reason to fight between proper participants!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_028,"In the end, it's important that the children get their presents and are happy!"
E_S1_Main0_1,"Then, the next topic is the supervision of the Orvel Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main0_2,"The Orvel Summer Beach Festival is one of Orvel's 3 most popular festivals, with Halloween and Christmas being the other two."
E_S1_Main0_3,"But Your Highness, right now, we're dealing with the Demons and the Holy Sword that just have appeared."
E_S1_Main0_4,I don't know if it's wise to hold such a big festival in a situation like this.
E_S1_Main0_5,"Hm, hm. As you all may know,"
E_S1_Main0_6,the Orvel Summer Beach Festival is a major event held every year.
E_S1_Main0_7,It's the only time of the year when anyone who's not a member of the royal family or an aristocrat can use the beach.
E_S1_Main0_8,This festival also has great influence on Orvel's economy.
E_S1_Main0_9,It's the only time when everyone can forget their worries and enjoy themselves.
E_S1_Main0_10,"Our people need this,"
E_S1_Main0_11,especially in troubled times like this.
E_S1_Main0_12,"But Your Highness, are you sure you want to supervise the festival yourself?"
E_S1_Main0_13,We can take care of it on our end.
E_S1_Main0_14,"I know you can, but I've made up my mind."
E_S1_Main0_15,Events like this always attract unsavory people.
E_S1_Main0_16,"But you still don't have to do it. Honestly, I'm worried."
E_S1_Main0_17,If something bad happens to you...
E_S1_Main0_18,Don't be.
E_S1_Main0_19,I've fought beside you all this time.
E_S1_Main0_20,"Also, Chase will be with me. Won't you?"
E_S1_Main0_21,I go where the Princess goes.
E_S1_Main0_22,She doesn't really take care of herself.
E_S1_Main0_23,That's why I have to take care of her.
E_S1_Main0_24,"Demia, Clause. You keep doing what you've been doing,"
E_S1_Main0_25,maintaining public order in Orvel and keeping an eye on our neighbors and the Demons.
E_S1_Main0_26,"I doubt anything will happen, but report to me right away if something does."
E_S1_Main0_27,As you command.
E_S1_Main0_28,"But Your Highness, Chase can only do so much."
E_S1_Main0_29,You two might not be enough to handle everything.
E_S1_Main0_30,I recommend you take a few soldiers with you.
E_S1_Main0_31,"Hm, you have a point."
E_S1_Main0_32,But no soldiers.
E_S1_Main0_33,"This festival is supposed to help our people relax, and seeing soldiers will only do the opposite."
E_S1_Main0_34,"Then, who should I take?"
E_S1_Main0_35,"Ah, right! She can come with me."
E_S1_Main0_36,She's always cooped up inside the castle.
E_S1_Main0_37,This is a good opportunity to let her get some fresh air.
E_S1_Main0_38,Huh? The Summer Festival?
E_S1_Main0_39,"Hm... No, thanks. I'm too busy with my research."
E_S1_Main0_40,"If you need help, why don't you take some soldiers with you?"
E_S1_Main0_41,We're worried that the sight of soldiers might not help the attendees relax.
E_S1_Main0_42,I'm proposing this to you
E_S1_Main0_43,"because you're perfect for this job, Annette."
E_S1_Main0_44,Chase and I will oversee the festival.
E_S1_Main0_45,All you have to do is just join the festival and help us sometimes.
E_S1_Main0_46,"And if you help me, I'll give you more research funds for the next 3 months."
E_S1_Main0_47,Err?
E_S1_Main0_48,That's not all.
E_S1_Main0_49,I've heard about your current experiment.
E_S1_Main0_50,I know you're studying that human-type golem from an ancient technomagic civilization that was excavated.
E_S1_Main0_51,"You're trying to awaken its emotions, aren't you?"
E_S1_Main0_52,How did you know? Heh heh.
E_S1_Main0_53,"But yes, Kara has a special function."
E_S1_Main0_54,"She generates electric signals similar to ours, though they're quite faint."
E_S1_Main0_55,"So, I've been teaching her human emotions."
E_S1_Main0_56,I want to know how much more human she can become.
E_S1_Main0_57,A festival involves a lot of people and interactions between them.
E_S1_Main0_58,"Don't you think it's a good opportunity to learn human emotions, especially happiness and excitement?"
E_S1_Main0_59,"Hm, that does sound interesting."
E_S1_Main0_60,"Alright, I'll come with you!"
E_S1_Main0_61,I think experimenting in that sort of environment holds a lot of promise!
E_S1_Main0_62,She's really strange.
E_S1_Main0_63,Why does it have to be her? I don't understand.
E_S1_Main0_64,"Ha ha. She may not look it, but she's Orvelia's most talented technomagi."
E_S1_Main0_65,She's next to none when it comes to creative thinking.
E_S1_Main0_66,Anything might happen during the festival. She'll be able to come up with a way to deal with anything we can't expect.
E_S1_Main0_67,"Now, the festival begins tomorrow."
E_S1_Main0_68,I've prepared some clothes for you for this special occasion. Try them on later.
E_S1_Main0_69,Clothes?
E_S1_Main1_1,Everyone's here.
E_S1_Main1_2,How do you like your new clothes that I had May from the grocery store get for you?
E_S1_Main1_3,I feel defenseless in them.
E_S1_Main1_4,Are they even practical?
E_S1_Main1_5,Cute! So cute!
E_S1_Main1_6,"Heh heh! Kara, you look good in anything!"
E_S1_Main1_7,"Master, I don't understand the purpose of these clothes."
E_S1_Main1_8,My body is perfectly waterproof...
E_S1_Main1_9,"No, you don't have to worry about that."
E_S1_Main1_10,"You're a girl, and girls should look cute!"
E_S1_Main1_11,"Master, I'm a machine and technically have no gender..."
E_S1_Main1_12,Just hush!
E_S1_Main1_13,"*Ahem* Now, the first big event of this summer is..."
E_S1_Main1_14,a large-scale barbecue party.
E_S1_Main1_15,"Ooh, are we eating meat?"
E_S1_Main1_16,That's right. And many other kinds of delicious food.
E_S1_Main1_17,It's going to be held here on the beach this afternoon.
E_S1_Main1_18,It's called the Festival of Prosperity!
E_S1_Main1_19,The Festival of... Prosperity.
E_S1_Main1_20,"The festival staff will gather the ingredients during the day,"
E_S1_Main1_21,and the cooks will prepare various foods with them in the afternoon.
E_S1_Main1_22,The participants are free to do whatever they want. They can play at the beach or hunt to help the staff.
E_S1_Main1_23,"Of course, hunting is limited to a certain area."
E_S1_Main1_24,We can't let the animals around here be hunted to extinction.
E_S1_Main1_25,We're here...
E_S1_Main1_26,Why? Is there a problem?
E_S1_Main1_27,"Mm. We don't know who they are yet, but I've got a report on them."
E_S1_Main1_28,Some people have been overhunting in the designated hunting ground
E_S1_Main1_29,and poaching outside it.
E_S1_Main1_30,"And there's a farm that grows vegetables for the barbecue party,"
E_S1_Main1_31,but someone stole vegetables from it.
E_S1_Main1_32,"This theft is not serious enough to affect the festival,"
E_S1_Main1_33,but it can't go unpunished.
E_S1_Main1_34,Do we need to go on watch duty?
E_S1_Main1_35,"Ack, watch? But I'm not a soldier."
E_S1_Main1_36,No! I'm here to do the experiment!
E_S1_Main1_37,"*Chuckle* We didn't come here on this beautiful day to just stand in one place, keeping watch. We came to enjoy the Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main1_38,"And like I said before, Annette and Kara, you're free to do whatever you want."
E_S1_Main1_39,I'll only contact you if I really need your help.
E_S1_Main1_40,"For now, let's split in groups of two and enjoy the festival like everyone else during the day."
E_S1_Main1_41,"And if we come across useful information, we can let each other know. Sound good?"
E_S1_Main1_42,"Yay! Yes, Your Highness!"
E_S1_Main1_43,"I'm going to the beach, of course! I'm not interested in hunting."
E_S1_Main1_44,"Alright, let's begin the experiment!"
E_S1_Main1_45,"Let's go, Kara! The sea is calling us!"
E_S1_Main1_46,"Master, you shouldn't run. It's too dangerous!"
E_S1_Main1_47,They're gone already.
E_S1_Main1_48,"Hah hah. They're so enthusiastic, aren't they?"
E_S1_Main2_1,"Hm, do you see anything, Chase?"
E_S1_Main2_2,"I've been looking around the hunting ground, watching the participants."
E_S1_Main2_3,"So far, none of them seems particularly troublesome to me."
E_S1_Main2_4,What about the farm?
E_S1_Main2_5,"No, I didn't see anything in particular."
E_S1_Main2_6,"It's missing some onions, bell peppers, and other grilling vegetables,"
E_S1_Main2_7,along with some other crops like carrots and corn.
E_S1_Main2_8,"About thirty servings' worth has been stolen,"
E_S1_Main2_9,but that's not enough to affect the festival.
E_S1_Main2_10,"Hm, about thirty servings..."
E_S1_Main2_11,"The fact that there's a thief among us is a problem, even if we ignore any effect it might have on the festival."
E_S1_Main2_12,It seems the number of game animals here has decreased.
E_S1_Main2_13,The participants I met on my way here said that it takes a long time to find them.
E_S1_Main2_14,"I felt that way, too."
E_S1_Main2_15,But none of the participants who are hunting right now
E_S1_Main2_16,is overhunting or poaching.
E_S1_Main2_17,No one has hunted more animals than they're allowed.
E_S1_Main2_18,I got it!
E_S1_Main2_19,Hm... Can't we eat this now?
E_S1_Main2_20,Not right now.
E_S1_Main2_21,That would go against the spirit of this festival.
E_S1_Main2_22,But everyone will be able to have their fill later.
E_S1_Main2_23,Ho ho. You've got another.
E_S1_Main2_24,"Jane, could you put it in the ice box?"
E_S1_Main2_25,....
E_S1_Main2_26,Are they Demons?
E_S1_Main2_27,"They've got wings, but I'm not sure."
E_S1_Main2_28,"Hm... Well, they haven't caused trouble yet. Let's keep an eye on them for now."
E_S1_Main2_29,Watch duty?
E_S1_Main2_30,Stop bringing up watch duty whenever there's a problem.
E_S1_Main2_31,"Hm... By the way, do you smell this?"
E_S1_Main2_32,It's...
E_S1_Main2_33,It smells like grilled meat.
E_S1_Main2_34,"The party hasn't begun, though."
E_S1_Main2_35,Let's go take a look.
E_S1_Main3_1,Meanwhile...
E_S1_Main3_2,"Oh, wow! It's the sea!"
E_S1_Main3_3,"Master, so what's this experiment you're talking about?"
E_S1_Main3_4,"Ah, that."
E_S1_Main3_5,"It's nothing. Just have fun, like ordinary people do!"
E_S1_Main3_6,The experiment will be a success if you can have fun!
E_S1_Main3_7,"Even if you can't have fun,"
E_S1_Main3_8,I can use the data for my reference. It's a win-win situation for us!
E_S1_Main3_9,Analyzing how ordinary people have fun...
E_S1_Main3_10,Yaaaaap! Take this! Tsunami!
E_S1_Main3_11,W-wait. Arrgghh!
E_S1_Main3_12,Poof! Pooooof!
E_S1_Main3_13,This beach has good sand. It's the perfect place to have a sand bath.
E_S1_Main3_14,Want me to cover you in sand? Should I go get a shovel?
E_S1_Main3_15,"I can even call my pirates, and I'll bury you even deeper!"
E_S1_Main3_16,Ordinary people?
E_S1_Main3_17,No. Useless samples.
E_S1_Main3_18,Hm. There are so many weirdos in this country that it's going to be challenging to find normal examples.
E_S1_Main3_19,Where can I find some other samples?
E_S1_Main3_20,"Mm? Zafir, what are you making?"
E_S1_Main3_21,This piece is... an ancient shrine.
E_S1_Main3_22,"Hm, you're as good with your hands as I remember."
E_S1_Main3_23,Can you make something else?
E_S1_Main3_24,"Hm... Then, how about a noble-looking sand cat...?"
E_S1_Main3_25,"Sonia, the ball went that way!"
E_S1_Main3_26,"Alright, my turn!"
E_S1_Main3_27,"Go, magic ball!"
E_S1_Main3_28,"Pfft, it's mine!"
E_S1_Main3_29,"Good job, Naila!"
E_S1_Main3_30,"Mm, they look mostly normal, but..."
E_S1_Main3_31,No. They're too advanced for Kara.
E_S1_Main3_32,"Ha ha ha, this experiment isn't going to be easy."
E_S1_Main3_33,But we're just getting started. I can do this!
E_S1_Main3_34,...?
E_S1_Main3_35,"Now, how about we go where there are many people?"
E_S1_Main3_36,"Mm... Kara, scan for a crowd of people around us."
E_S1_Main3_37,Activating heat sensor. Scanning for groups of heat sources...
E_S1_Main3_38,"Multiple heat sources detected, approximately 1 kilometer away to the northeast."
E_S1_Main3_39,"Alright, let's go!"
E_S1_Main3_40,"Master, you don't have to hurry."
E_S1_Main4_1,This... What's going on?
E_S1_Main4_2,I have no idea.
E_S1_Main4_3,"There, there! Gather around!"
E_S1_Main4_4,"I've got tons of meat! I, Viska, hunted it myself!"
E_S1_Main4_5,"If you want it, come get it!"
E_S1_Main4_6,"If you don't, I'm gonna eat it all!"
E_S1_Main4_7,"Ah, I've got some vegetables, too, if you like vegetables. They're not for me!"
E_S1_Main4_8,Gagagagak... (Meat...)
E_S1_Main4_9,Gugagagak... (But no belly...)
E_S1_Main4_10,Gagak... (Can't eat...)
E_S1_Main4_11,Gughhh... (Can eat...)
E_S1_Main4_12,Gwogh... (But can't taste...)
E_S1_Main4_13,Why am I doing this?
E_S1_Main4_14,"Why not? It's fun, isn't it?"
E_S1_Main4_15,"It's festival time. We Demons need to enjoy sometimes, too."
E_S1_Main4_16,"Of course, we can't ask those humans to include us in their festival."
E_S1_Main4_17,That's why we're celebrating it on our own. Keh heh heh.
E_S1_Main4_18,"By the way, why do I have to be the cook?"
E_S1_Main4_19,"Why not? This could help improve your reputation among other Demons, you know."
E_S1_Main4_20,"The (former) Draconics General who sends her soldiers on free group vacations, and grills meat for them, too."
E_S1_Main4_21,Maria's reputation can improve as well along the way.
E_S1_Main4_22,Who knows? Your unit might end up becoming the Number One unit of the Dark Legion.
E_S1_Main4_23,"(Actually, I just didn't feel like grilling it myself!)"
E_S1_Main4_24,Nonsense.
E_S1_Main4_25,You're not even in the Dark Legion. You must have some hidden agenda to suggest things like that.
E_S1_Main4_26,"These ones aren't in the Dark Legion, either."
E_S1_Main4_27,"They're drifters, just like you."
E_S1_Main4_28,Keh heh. You got me.
E_S1_Main4_29,"But come on, don't be like that."
E_S1_Main4_30,Everyone's having fun. Can't you see?
E_S1_Main4_31,Mehhh. (I prefer grass over meat. Where are the grilled vegetables?)
E_S1_Main4_32,*Crunch*
E_S1_Main4_33,Charred meat.
E_S1_Main4_34,The (former) General is not good at cooking.
E_S1_Main4_35,....
E_S1_Main4_36,"Alright, things are going as planned."
E_S1_Main4_37,This meat imbued with strong energy should strengthen those who eat it.
E_S1_Main4_38,"I also marinated it with those blue potions. From the labels, they're May's EXP Potions."
E_S1_Main4_39,"Keep feeding it to weak Demons, and it should make them grow stronger!"
E_S1_Main4_40,And in the end... I'm going to eat them all! Keh heh heh!
E_S1_Main4_41,"Yes, this is my Demon Farm plan!"
E_S1_Main4_42,.......
E_S1_Main4_43,That'll definitely taste awful.
E_S1_Main4_44,How did those Demons come here!?
E_S1_Main4_45,"There are so many, as if someone opened a portal for them."
E_S1_Main4_46,"Ah, Annette and Kara."
E_S1_Main4_47,...?!!!
E_S1_Main4_48,"Err, what's this? I thought I saw a lot of people, but they're Demons?"
E_S1_Main4_49,Well... we can always conduct a combat experiment instead. Kara!
E_S1_Main4_50,Entering Combat mode...
E_S1_Main4_51,"Master, please step back."
E_S1_Main4_52,....
E_S1_Main4_53,Princess...?
E_S1_Main4_54,"Hm, I have no idea what's going on,"
E_S1_Main4_55,but let's go help Annette for now!
E_S1_Main4_56,"Let's go, Chase!"
E_S1_Main5_1,"Sheesh, even hellhounds deserve to eat in peace!"
E_S1_Main5_2,I'm not even in the Dark Legion! Don't bother me!
E_S1_Main5_3,"We heard you guys were having a meat party today. We like meat, too!"
E_S1_Main5_4,"Hm, you may not be in the Dark Legion,"
E_S1_Main5_5,but I was told that red one is.
E_S1_Main5_6,*Snort* I only serve Maria.
E_S1_Main5_7,"If you want to fight, I'll fight you, but there'll be no point to it."
E_S1_Main5_8,I only came here because she threatened me.
E_S1_Main5_9,"If it weren't for her, I would be taking a stroll along the beach with Maria by now. Hmpf!"
E_S1_Main5_10,Threatened you?
E_S1_Main5_11,"I planned to enjoy a relaxing vacation with Maria,"
E_S1_Main5_12,"but then she said if I didn't help her, she wouldn't leave me alone all summer."
E_S1_Main5_13,So what?
E_S1_Main5_14,Why can't you just help me!?
E_S1_Main5_15,"I promised you that instead, I'd leave you alone for 2 months!"
E_S1_Main5_16,"You're the most delicious-looking thing here, but I'm still keeping my promise!"
E_S1_Main5_17,*Sigh* This is our current situation.
E_S1_Main5_18,"Well, alright."
E_S1_Main5_19,"So, you were just enjoying some meat,"
E_S1_Main5_20,"and Annette instigated this hostility, I presume?"
E_S1_Main5_21,Eh heh heh.
E_S1_Main5_22,I thought it was a good opportunity to experiment.
E_S1_Main5_23,You know what my dream is. I want to popularize a technomagic weapon for self-protection!
E_S1_Main5_24,"Demons are Demons, our enemies."
E_S1_Main5_25,Enemies are to be defeated.
E_S1_Main5_26,"That's not wrong, but..."
E_S1_Main5_27,Gagagak... Gugagak... (Don't want to fight... The dead shouldn't work...)
E_S1_Main5_28,Gagagagigigik... (Worked enough for Malduk already...)
E_S1_Main5_29,Gagugagugak... (Got strange magic in return... being frozen or burned...)
E_S1_Main5_30,Ggghhhh.... (Just going to eat the meat...)
E_S1_Main5_31,Gwaaahhh... (Can't taste... but chew still...)
E_S1_Main5_32,Ehhh? (No intestines?)
E_S1_Main5_33,Mehhh? (More vegetables... No carrots?)
E_S1_Main5_34,I don't feel right about attacking these Demons.
E_S1_Main5_35,*Sigh* How did this happen?
E_S1_Main5_36,"Anyway, I'm glad you didn't steal enough food to put a halt to our festival."
E_S1_Main5_37,"I know, right?"
E_S1_Main5_38,No discrimination against the Demons!
E_S1_Main5_39,I want to eat rice (souls) and meat!
E_S1_Main5_40,"Well, alright. I can show some generosity to you, at least during this festival."
E_S1_Main5_41,"I'll let you Demons barbecue among yourselves, so long as you don't cause trouble to us humans."
E_S1_Main5_42,"In case you want more meat, I'll open a temporary hunting ground for you. Use it,"
E_S1_Main5_43,and I expect you to refrain from hunting or stealing from outside it.
E_S1_Main5_44,"Yippee! I like you, human!"
E_S1_Main5_45,"Hm, this means we'll have to forget about the combat experiment."
E_S1_Main5_46,But we can try something else!
E_S1_Main5_47,"They can't enjoy themselves, eating such terrible-tasting meat."
E_S1_Main5_48,"Kara, now's the time for you to show off your skills as a court cook!"
E_S1_Main5_49,"Now, go!"
E_S1_Main5_50,Entering Cooking mode...
E_S1_Main5_51,Completed calibrating the laser beam.
E_S1_Main5_52,Initiating cooking...
E_S1_Main5_53,...
E_S1_Main5_54,*Mumble mumble*
E_S1_Main5_55,It's pretty good.
E_S1_Main5_56,"Princess, try it."
E_S1_Main5_57,That machine cooks better than you do.
E_S1_Main5_58,...
E_S1_Main6_1,"Mm... Well, some strange stuff happened right on the first day,"
E_S1_Main6_2,but the Demons left peacefully after eating their meat.
E_S1_Main6_3,Nothing serious happened. Whew.
E_S1_Main6_4,....
E_S1_Main6_5,"Hah hah, ah hah hah hah."
E_S1_Main6_6,"I'm sorry you had to experience that on the first day, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main6_7,"By the way, Morrah was the cook..."
E_S1_Main6_8,I'm sorry. I'll try to find out how they were able to sneak in.
E_S1_Main6_9,"Thank you, Demia."
E_S1_Main6_10,"Is there anything else we should know about, Your Highness?"
E_S1_Main6_11,Aside from a Demon who had a stomachache from eating too much meat
E_S1_Main6_12,"and a rabbit that showed up all of a sudden, taking away all the remaining vegetables, a lot of interesting things happened."
E_S1_Main6_13,Still... I'm only thankful that the Festival of Prosperity in the afternoon was so successful.
E_S1_Main6_14,"Seeing how many unexpected things happened on the first day, I say we'd better stay on guard for the remainder of the festival."
E_S1_Main6_15,I have a feeling things are going to be crazy until the end. *Chuckle*
E_S1_Main6_16,"Then, Chase and I better go supervise the next event."
E_S1_Main6_17,"See you later, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main6_18,*Ahem*
E_S1_Main6_19,"I understand what we experienced yesterday was disconcerting,"
E_S1_Main6_20,"but today, another event takes place."
E_S1_Main6_21,What is it today?
E_S1_Main6_22,I had fun yesterday. I'm really liking this festival thing!
E_S1_Main6_23,"I hope it's something Kara can enjoy, too."
E_S1_Main6_24,She can.
E_S1_Main6_25,"It's a water gun competition, open to people of all ages and genders."
E_S1_Main6_26,Many talented gun-shooters from everywhere on the continent will also participate to show off their shooting skills in teams of 2 people.
E_S1_Main6_27,It's called the Festival of Gun-shooting!
E_S1_Main6_28,Interesting.
E_S1_Main6_29,What's the prize for the First Place winner?
E_S1_Main6_30,"Mm, it's ten million Gold worth of..."
E_S1_Main6_31,TEN MILLION GOLD!?
E_S1_Main6_32,"Kara! Just for today,"
E_S1_Main6_33,I've added the water gun feature to your optical weapon!
E_S1_Main6_34,Let's go!
E_S1_Main6_35,Victory is ours!
E_S1_Main6_36,I suppose money really talks.
E_S1_Main6_37,"Chase, don't you want to try?"
E_S1_Main6_38,I'm not interested in money.
E_S1_Main6_39,I'm content at the moment.
E_S1_Main6_40,*Chuckle* I see.
E_S1_Main6_41,"Then, let's go, shall we?"
E_S1_Main7_1,"Hello, I'm May! I'll be the commentator during the Festival of Gun-shooting today."
E_S1_Main7_2,Enjoy this event in which we'll find out who is Orvel's best water gun-shooting team!
E_S1_Main7_3,"Thank you. And if you have time, feel free to visit the Grocery and buy many things!"
E_S1_Main7_4,"I'm with Gladi, the referee for the day. Gladi, wave your hand!"
E_S1_Main7_5,"Now, let me introduce the finalists of the day!"
E_S1_Main7_6,Here we have the players who will join the battle royal of the day...
E_S1_Main7_7,Here's the first team!
E_S1_Main7_8,"Coming from the freezing mountainous area, Windland,"
E_S1_Main7_9,"is the talented sniper, Rodina!"
E_S1_Main7_10,"And the cute rabbit girl, Luna!"
E_S1_Main7_11,I'm going to buy lots of carrots with my prize money!
E_S1_Main7_12,"By the way, that's not a water gun. Isn't that a water balloon slingshot?"
E_S1_Main7_13,"The referee says it doesn't matter, so long as I can drench people in water!"
E_S1_Main7_14,They've got a cannon over there.
E_S1_Main7_15,"Now, for our second team!"
E_S1_Main7_16,He likes anything that explodes!
E_S1_Main7_17,"Lakrak, the goblin bomber!"
E_S1_Main7_18,"And the self-proclaimed Pirate Empress, Miruru!"
E_S1_Main7_19,"What!? No, I earned that title!"
E_S1_Main7_20,I used to be a famous pirate in my time!
E_S1_Main7_21,"Bwa hah, that not matter now!"
E_S1_Main7_22,We get prize money and make big bomb!
E_S1_Main7_23,Our third team!
E_S1_Main7_24,They're a pair of ex-Navy soldiers from the distant Empire!
E_S1_Main7_25,"The coldhearted bounty hunter, Crow!"
E_S1_Main7_26,"And the captain of the infamous Steel Wolf Mercenaries, Mitra!"
E_S1_Main7_27,"Hey, old man."
E_S1_Main7_28,Doesn't this remind you of old times? Kya hah hah!
E_S1_Main7_29,*Sigh*
E_S1_Main7_30,"I really want a smoke really bad, especially today."
E_S1_Main7_31,"Lastly,"
E_S1_Main7_32,"coming from the Orvel Castle herself,"
E_S1_Main7_33,"Royal Technomagi, Annette!"
E_S1_Main7_34,"And her assistant, Kara!"
E_S1_Main7_35,"Whoo! Hello, everyone!"
E_S1_Main7_36,The prize money is mine. All of you can go home now!
E_S1_Main7_37,"Master, please try not to say anything that can draw attention to us."
E_S1_Main7_38,Everyone is looking at us because of what you just said.
E_S1_Main7_39,"Ah hah hah, really?"
E_S1_Main7_40,"Well, it's okay!"
E_S1_Main7_41,"Kara, you'll take care of them all, right?"
E_S1_Main7_42,Activate Anti-personnel mode! Wipe the floor with them!
E_S1_Main7_43,"Roger that, Master."
E_S1_Main8_1,"Mwa hah hah, take the water bombs!"
E_S1_Main8_2,"Bwa hah, see how long you avoid bomb!"
E_S1_Main8_3,Miruru and Lakrak are shooting a volley of water bombs while the other players are fighting each other!
E_S1_Main8_4,The others are taking cover.
E_S1_Main8_5,Let's see how they handle this situation.
E_S1_Main8_6,*Exhale*
E_S1_Main8_7,Ugyak!
E_S1_Main8_8,"Ah, Lakrak was hit by Rodina's snipe shot! But..."
E_S1_Main8_9,I... count on... you!
E_S1_Main8_10,Don't worry!
E_S1_Main8_11,"Let's go, Miruru Pirates!"
E_S1_Main8_12,Oooohhhh!
E_S1_Main8_13,Gyagyagyak!
E_S1_Main8_14,"An army of gnolls and goblins sprang out of the sand, shooting water bombs!"
E_S1_Main8_15,Isn't this cheating?
E_S1_Main8_16,"Referee Gladi, what do you think?"
E_S1_Main8_17,...
E_S1_Main8_18,"It looked awesome, so it's okay!"
E_S1_Main8_19,What? Even the Referee!
E_S1_Main8_20,Pirates like don't care about the rules!
E_S1_Main8_21,"Let's go, guys!"
E_S1_Main8_22,Shoot them with water!
E_S1_Main8_23,Heeek!
E_S1_Main8_24,I can't hit each and every single one of them!
E_S1_Main8_25,"Whoa, they're so many."
E_S1_Main8_26,This is why I brought the carrots. Take this!
E_S1_Main8_27,Piong!
E_S1_Main8_28,???
E_S1_Main8_29,Kwaaakkk!
E_S1_Main8_30,YELP!
E_S1_Main8_31,Kyak!
E_S1_Main8_32,Ah! Miruru and her subordinates!
E_S1_Main8_33,"The gigantic carrot-shaped water balloon that fell from the sky exploded, taking them all out!"
E_S1_Main8_34,What a turn of events! Incredible!
E_S1_Main8_35,"Oooh, that's amazing!"
E_S1_Main8_36,"Kara, can you do something like that?"
E_S1_Main8_37,Scanning my functions...
E_S1_Main8_38,"Master, I have yet to develop the ability to summon and drop carrots from the moon."
E_S1_Main8_39,I'd better add that to your to-be-added function list!
E_S1_Main8_40,"Wow, good job, Luna!"
E_S1_Main8_41,"Then, the next... kyaaaah!"
E_S1_Main8_42,Don't take this personally.
E_S1_Main8_43,You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
E_S1_Main8_44,"Keh heh heh, die! Die! DIE!"
E_S1_Main8_45,Look at the barrage of water! Dozens of powerful water bullets are hitting where Rodina and Luna are hiding!
E_S1_Main8_46,They'll get hit if they take even a step away from where they are!
E_S1_Main8_47,"Oooh, I don't think this can move."
E_S1_Main8_48,"Amazing, so amazing!"
E_S1_Main8_49,Is this the technomagic of the Empire?
E_S1_Main8_50,I've heard it's been developing a weapon that combines technomagic and mechanical engineering.
E_S1_Main8_51,"Hmpf, stay hidden."
E_S1_Main8_52,Yaaaaaah!
E_S1_Main8_53,Kyaaaa!
E_S1_Main8_54,Aaaaaah!
E_S1_Main8_55,The water! It drilled through the rock!
E_S1_Main8_56,"Both Rodina and Luna,"
E_S1_Main8_57,"even though they were hiding behind a rock, got hit by the water cannon and eliminated!"
E_S1_Main8_58,"As the supervisor, I don't want to intervene,"
E_S1_Main8_59,but don't you think those water guns are way too powerful?
E_S1_Main8_60,This year's festival is not going as smoothly as I thought.
E_S1_Main8_61,I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that.
E_S1_Main9_1,We're down to the final 2 teams!
E_S1_Main9_2,Crow reloads his weapon!
E_S1_Main9_3,"Mitra gives him covering fire, keeping Kara and Annette at bay!"
E_S1_Main9_4,Kya hah hah hah!
E_S1_Main9_5,Why don't you poke your head out a little bit?
E_S1_Main9_6,"Come on, bring it on!"
E_S1_Main9_7,"Shut up, mongrel."
E_S1_Main9_8,I only joined this competition because you wouldn't leave me alone if I didn't.
E_S1_Main9_9,"Stop annoying me, or you'll regret later."
E_S1_Main9_10,"Sorry, but I can't do that."
E_S1_Main9_11,"Whatever you say, old man, I'm not scared!"
E_S1_Main9_12,"You're not my boss anymore, anyway!"
E_S1_Main9_13,Kyah hah hah! Die! Die! Die!
E_S1_Main9_14,"Kara, can't you do something about that?"
E_S1_Main9_15,It's time to show them whose weapon is superior.
E_S1_Main9_16,Roger that.
E_S1_Main9_17,"Activating the water gun, a modified version of magic cannon..."
E_S1_Main9_18,Initializing wide-area cannon...
E_S1_Main9_19,Kya hah hah. Mm?
E_S1_Main9_20,"Lower your head, mongrel!"
E_S1_Main9_21,"Wow, that's impressive!"
E_S1_Main9_22,"Not as impressive as your Akistra, though!"
E_S1_Main9_23,It's not recharged yet. I can't do what I did last time.
E_S1_Main9_24,You'd better hide until then.
E_S1_Main9_25,"Good job, Kara!"
E_S1_Main9_26,"Now, it's time to retaliate. Go, cutie!"
E_S1_Main9_27,!!!
E_S1_Main9_28,Switching to Siege mode...
E_S1_Main9_29,Initializing rapid shot...
E_S1_Main9_30,*Whistle* What an incredible rate of fire! Its firepower is also impressive!
E_S1_Main9_31,It can drill through rock. Can that actually kill us?
E_S1_Main9_32,"Referee, isn't this cheating?"
E_S1_Main9_33,"Oh wait, then you would've been cheating, too, old man."
E_S1_Main9_34,"Booooo, cheaters! Why are you playing so dirty?"
E_S1_Main9_35,...
E_S1_Main10_1,They're neck and neck with each other!
E_S1_Main10_2,Both teams have incredible rate of fire!
E_S1_Main10_3,Is this the power of technomagic?
E_S1_Main10_4,"Referee, don't you think both teams are cheating at this point?"
E_S1_Main10_5,This is fun! It's okay!
E_S1_Main10_6,The Referee says it's okay!
E_S1_Main10_7,"By the way, Referee, despite the amount of water flying around, you're completely dry!"
E_S1_Main10_8,*Chuckle* I'm called the Beast of the Arena for a reason.
E_S1_Main10_9,This is a piece of cake!
E_S1_Main10_10,"Kara, are you ready?"
E_S1_Main10_11,"I am, Master. I'm fully charged."
E_S1_Main10_12,Initializing the siege water cannon...
E_S1_Main10_13,"Old man, are you not ready yet?"
E_S1_Main10_14,"I am now. Get out of my way, mongrel!"
E_S1_Main10_15,Haaaaaah!
E_S1_Main10_16,Fire.
E_S1_Main10_17,I can't tell
E_S1_Main10_18,if this is a festival or a battlefield.
E_S1_Main10_19,So much water...
E_S1_Main10_20,It's salty because it's seawater.
E_S1_Main10_21,.....
E_S1_Main10_22,You're calm despite the situation. I'm envious of you.
E_S1_Main10_23,"Anyway, I wonder who won."
E_S1_Main10_24,So much water!
E_S1_Main10_25,I can't see anything!
E_S1_Main10_26,Who do you think won?
E_S1_Main10_27,The winning team... The winning team is... Err?
E_S1_Main10_28,Kara! Crow!
E_S1_Main10_29,Both are down!
E_S1_Main10_30,"Now, it's only up to Mitra and Annette!"
E_S1_Main10_31,I can't wait to see who wins!
E_S1_Main10_32,"Ah, I give up."
E_S1_Main10_33,?!?!?!?!?!
E_S1_Main10_34,"Doing this without Kara is pointless. I mean, I'm here to do some experimenting."
E_S1_Main10_35,Let's just call it a day. That was fun!
E_S1_Main10_35_1,"Such a shame for the prize, but I can't help it!"
E_S1_Main10_36,....
E_S1_Main10_37,Hey! You can't do that!
E_S1_Main10_38,Bring it on! I still want to play...
E_S1_Main10_39,....
E_S1_Main10_40,Misbehaving mongrels like you deserve a good beating.
E_S1_Main10_41,*Gasp*
E_S1_Main10_42,"Ah, wait... old man..."
E_S1_Main10_43,Got a hit... in bread basket... *Passes out*
E_S1_Main10_44,Err... Mm...
E_S1_Main10_45,So! Today's winning team is Mitra and Crow!
E_S1_Main10_46,"Medical Team, please come and carry away the wounded!"
E_S1_Main10_47,"Ho ho ho. Sure, give us a minute!"
E_S1_Main10_48,*Sigh* I really want a smoke right now...
E_S1_Main10_49,Hm...
E_S1_Main10_50,"At least, nothing that forced us to intervene happened,"
E_S1_Main10_51,but maybe it's necessary to add some new rules to next year's Summer Festival.
E_S1_Main10_52,We can't have people running around with deadly water guns.
E_S1_Main10_53,Good idea.
E_S1_Main11_1,I've got a report from the Medical Team.
E_S1_Main11_2,"Fortunately, no one got seriously wounded."
E_S1_Main11_3,"The one named Mitra got punched in the solar plexus by his own teammate, Crow, and was carted away."
E_S1_Main11_4,That Crow looked pretty strong.
E_S1_Main11_5,"His weapon didn't look like a toy, either."
E_S1_Main11_6,"Getting punched by that fist would've knocked me out, too."
E_S1_Main11_7,Things have been pretty hectic since the festival began.
E_S1_Main11_8,"But fortunately, today's event is relatively safe."
E_S1_Main11_9,The Festival of Health. It's celebrated to wish everyone in Orvelia good health.
E_S1_Main11_10,"It's the day when beneficial herbs and other medicinal ingredients,"
E_S1_Main11_11,and health foods made of such ingredients are being sold.
E_S1_Main11_12,It's also the day that you can learn many things about medicine.
E_S1_Main11_13,"Oooh, how interesting!"
E_S1_Main11_14,Most summer festivals are all about playing and having fun.
E_S1_Main11_15,"It's a big event among the kingdom's reputed alchemists, potion makers, and doctors."
E_S1_Main11_16,"It's a good chance to see extremely rare ingredients, too."
E_S1_Main11_17,Clause told me about it.
E_S1_Main11_18,"He can't come because of his duties,"
E_S1_Main11_19,so he asked me to get some ingredients for him.
E_S1_Main11_20,He said he wants to give them to Orphanage Principal Ricardo.
E_S1_Main11_21,"Ricardo, the commander of the Holy Knights, is like a father to him."
E_S1_Main11_22,This is so like Clause. *Chuckle*
E_S1_Main11_23,"Master, why don't you take care of your health, too?"
E_S1_Main11_24,"You're always cooped up in your lab, working for hours without moving around much."
E_S1_Main11_25,"Unlike me, you're not a machine. Your body can break easily."
E_S1_Main11_26,Don't worry.
E_S1_Main11_27,I'm not that old yet!
E_S1_Main11_28,I'll drink more health drinks from now on.
E_S1_Main11_29,"If I break, you can fix me."
E_S1_Main11_30,"But if you break, I can't."
E_S1_Main11_31,"Ooh, Kara, are you worried about me?"
E_S1_Main11_32,Have you learned what it's like to be worried?
E_S1_Main11_33,Worried?
E_S1_Main11_34,Mm... I'm not sure.
E_S1_Main11_35,I just said what came to mind.
E_S1_Main11_36,Is that called being worried?
E_S1_Main11_37,It seems her experiment is going well. *Chuckle*
E_S1_Main11_38,"Now, then let's go check"
E_S1_Main11_39,how well the festival is going.
E_S1_Main12_1,"Heh heh heh, it's finally the day."
E_S1_Main12_2,Hah hah hah. That's right. We've been waiting so long.
E_S1_Main12_3,The time has come for us to realize our dream!
E_S1_Main12_4,Are you done with your experiment?
E_S1_Main12_5,I heard you tried out a new test subject yesterday.
E_S1_Main12_6,"Ho ho ho. Yes, a really healthy test subject."
E_S1_Main12_7,"Ah, the experience is still fresh in my mind."
E_S1_Main12_8,Zzz... Zzz...
E_S1_Main12_9,"Oh, he's sleeping pretty peacefully, considering he got punched in the solar plexus."
E_S1_Main12_10,Do you think he's recovered already?
E_S1_Main12_11,Let him sleep. He'll wake up on his own soon.
E_S1_Main12_12,"This is not the first time he got punched by me, and it won't be the last."
E_S1_Main12_13,I'm leaving. I've got business to attend to.
E_S1_Main12_14,"Oh, aren't you going to stay until the end of the festival?"
E_S1_Main12_15,Tomorrow is the Festival of Health.
E_S1_Main12_16,"You're holding candy in your mouth because you're trying to quit smoking, aren't you?"
E_S1_Main12_17,Maybe you can find some herbs or foods that can help you with your withdrawal symptoms.
E_S1_Main12_18,Not interested.
E_S1_Main12_19,Smoking isn't the only reason
E_S1_Main12_20,I've got this candy in my mouth.
E_S1_Main12_21,"Oh, how disappointing!"
E_S1_Main12_22,"Ho ho ho. Now that the obstacle is gone,"
E_S1_Main12_23,how about we move on to the next treatment (experiment)?
E_S1_Main12_24,"Heh, so how did it go?"
E_S1_Main12_25,"He got very healthy and bolted out of here right away, of course."
E_S1_Main12_26,"Oh, but he might have been foaming at the mouth at the same time."
E_S1_Main12_27,"I don't think he'll experience serious side effects, though. Ho ho ho."
E_S1_Main12_28,"Well, since the medicine is based on the werewolf blood that Yanne got for me,"
E_S1_Main12_29,he might become hyperactive or run after the moon for a little while.
E_S1_Main12_30,"Heh heh, then this is a huge success!"
E_S1_Main12_31,"Ah, I think I've heard you procured another valuable test subject."
E_S1_Main12_32,"Ah hah hah, that's..."
E_S1_Main13_1,Ho ho ho ho ho!
E_S1_Main13_2,Half-human half-demon... Who knew I'd get ahold of such a precious test subject so easily?
E_S1_Main13_3,Hey! What the hell!?
E_S1_Main13_4,I followed you because you said you'd give me pudding.
E_S1_Main13_5,Why are you doing this to me!?
E_S1_Main13_6,"Ho ho, you had your pudding."
E_S1_Main13_7,"Now, it's time you helped me with my experiment."
E_S1_Main13_8,"Hey, but no needles!"
E_S1_Main13_9,I hate needles!
E_S1_Main13_10,Mm... How about we draw some blood from you first?
E_S1_Main13_11,Your Half-Demon blood will be a very valuable test material.
E_S1_Main13_12,Aww! Hey! No! Take that away!
E_S1_Main13_13,This human is killing a Half-Demon! Help! Someone save this Half-Demon!
E_S1_Main13_14,Ho ho ho. It won't hurt.
E_S1_Main13_15,It might sting a little bit at first.
E_S1_Main13_16,Excuse me.
E_S1_Main13_17,Mm? Did something pass us by?
E_S1_Main13_18,"Huh? If it did, I didn't see it."
E_S1_Main13_19,Epis! Where are you...?
E_S1_Main13_20,Mm?
E_S1_Main13_21,Ezekiel? What are you doing here?
E_S1_Main13_22,"Oh, do you know him?"
E_S1_Main13_23,"Bah, couldn't you come earlier?"
E_S1_Main13_24,Do something about this crazy woman!
E_S1_Main13_25,She keeps trying to draw my blood!
E_S1_Main13_26,"Crazy woman? Oh, that's hurtful."
E_S1_Main13_27,I just want to draw some blood for testing purposes.
E_S1_Main13_28,"Half-Demon blood is rare, so it's a very precious research material."
E_S1_Main13_29,I hate needles!
E_S1_Main13_30,*Sigh* Fine.
E_S1_Main13_31,How about I give you another cup of pudding? Will you let me?
E_S1_Main13_32,...!!!
E_S1_Main13_33,....
E_S1_Main13_34,Two. If you give two...
E_S1_Main13_35,Good.
E_S1_Main13_36,"*Sigh* Just get it over with, Ezekiel."
E_S1_Main13_37,Epis just passed by.
E_S1_Main13_38,We'd better go after her.
E_S1_Main13_39,Hey.
E_S1_Main13_40,Mm?
E_S1_Main13_41,"I know you want to find her, but we're at a festival."
E_S1_Main13_42,And festivals are supposed to be enjoyed. Even I know that.
E_S1_Main13_43,But...
E_S1_Main13_44,"That succubus probably came here to enjoy the festival, too. You know her."
E_S1_Main13_45,And she's not going to go anywhere soon.
E_S1_Main13_46,Who knows? She might be dancing with your lady happily somewhere.
E_S1_Main13_47,...
E_S1_Main13_48,"Just relax, dude."
E_S1_Main13_49,I'll let you have one of my pudding cups.
E_S1_Main13_50,Let's eat them and enjoy this festival for now.
E_S1_Main13_51,Alright.
E_S1_Main13_52,Err? Is it done already?
E_S1_Main13_53,Yes. You may leave now.
E_S1_Main13_54,"As a doctor, I don't lie to my patients."
E_S1_Main13_55,"Here, I'll put your pudding in your bag. Enjoy it."
E_S1_Main13_56,Yippee! Pudding time!
E_S1_Main13_57,"Wait, Ezekiel!"
E_S1_Main13_58,Ho ho ho. Precious Half-Demon blood...
E_S1_Main13_59,I can't wait to make potions with this blood charged with powerful mana.
E_S1_Main13_60,"Replace the werewolf blood with the Half-Demon blood... And a little bit of belladonna... Oops, where did the time go?"
E_S1_Main13_61,I'd better call it a day now.
E_S1_Main13_62,Ho ho ho. Has everyone gone?
E_S1_Main13_63,Jane! Wake up. Let's go to the night market.
E_S1_Main13_64,Let's go get some snacks.
E_S1_Main13_65,Ooh...
E_S1_Main13_66,I see. I was curious how you got ahold of that Half-Demon blood since it's pretty hard to get.
E_S1_Main13_67,Could you give me some of it later? Heh heh heh.
E_S1_Main13_68,Sure thing. Ho ho ho.
E_S1_Main13_69,It was because of you I could make such great potions for this year's festival.
E_S1_Main13_70,This is all for the sake of...
E_S1_Main13_71,transforming poison into a world-class medicine!
E_S1_Main14_1,"Hm, everything looks fine."
E_S1_Main14_2,"By the way, Annette, you bought so many potions."
E_S1_Main14_3,Why do you need so many?
E_S1_Main14_4,"I can go through them in a few days if I stay up all night, working."
E_S1_Main14_5,"I stock up on them whenever I can, to save money."
E_S1_Main14_6,"I hate it when I get a great idea in the middle of the night, but I can't try it because I'm tired."
E_S1_Main14_7,"Hm, what if you overdose on them?"
E_S1_Main14_8,I've tested and verified that one cannot overdose on May's special potions.
E_S1_Main14_9,You also cannot be poisoned by them.
E_S1_Main14_10,I didn't know you gave her a feature to detect poison.
E_S1_Main14_11,"Oh, I never added that. It was one of her original features."
E_S1_Main14_12,"Mm, the last place to shop today is over there."
E_S1_Main14_13,This is where the Medical Team's tents are.
E_S1_Main14_14,"Ah, there's a small stall in front of one."
E_S1_Main14_15,"Hello, hello!"
E_S1_Main14_16,Welcome to Requina's General Store!
E_S1_Main14_17,I've got nothing but a wide collection of health products for today's festival.
E_S1_Main14_18,Feel free to take a look around!
E_S1_Main14_19,!!!
E_S1_Main14_20,Be careful.
E_S1_Main14_21,That poison is toxic.
E_S1_Main14_22,"Ah, that one over there, too."
E_S1_Main14_23,"That, that, and that, too."
E_S1_Main14_24,Err? Are you buggy?
E_S1_Main14_25,"I've had a lot of health drinks and medicines Requina prepared before,"
E_S1_Main14_26,and I've never had a problem with them.
E_S1_Main14_27,"In fact, they work better than the others I tried!"
E_S1_Main14_28,Are these strange-colored potions health drinks?
E_S1_Main14_29,"Yes! They taste peculiar, and may make you feel a weird kind of tingly, but..."
E_S1_Main14_30,The taste grows on you!
E_S1_Main14_31,Why don't you take a sip yourself? Heh heh.
E_S1_Main14_32,....
E_S1_Main14_33,!!!!
E_S1_Main14_34,"Chase! Are you okay, Chase?"
E_S1_Main14_35,P-Princess...
E_S1_Main14_36,It's... delicious! Very much so!
E_S1_Main14_37,....
E_S1_Main14_38,Heh heh. Requina's General Store exists to promulgate the usefulness of poisons.
E_S1_Main14_39,"Poisons work differently, depending on the user."
E_S1_Main14_40,"They're used for assassination and other unsavory purposes, of course, but when used carefully, they can be as beneficial as medicinal herbs."
E_S1_Main14_41,"In fact, since they consist of substances unfamiliar to our bodies, they are absorbed quickly and provide more powerful effects than herbs."
E_S1_Main14_42,"Hm, I don't think I know exactly what you're saying, but..."
E_S1_Main14_43,Healthy poisons? That's pretty strange.
E_S1_Main14_44,There's also a new product that Mediana in the Medical Team and I have developed together!
E_S1_Main14_45,"This is a good opportunity, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main14_46,How'd you like to sample this freshly launched new product?
E_S1_Main14_47,"This potion contains the blood of a half-human half-demon,"
E_S1_Main14_48,"and that combination of two conflicting energies generates explosive power, along with a healthy poison."
E_S1_Main14_49,You can't find this new product anywhere else. Ho ho ho.
E_S1_Main14_50,Hm.
E_S1_Main14_51,Are you sure it's safe?
E_S1_Main14_52,The people over there just drank it.
E_S1_Main14_53,Look how healthy they are!
E_S1_Main14_54,!?*@&!?*@&!?*@&
E_S1_Main14_55,You think they're healthy?
E_S1_Main14_56,They're so healthy that they can't stop moving.
E_S1_Main14_57,"It's okay, Your Highness. Moving so vigorously and sweating so profusely"
E_S1_Main14_58,helps promote good health!
E_S1_Main14_59,"Ho ho... Ho ho ho... Then, thank you for participating in our experiment."
E_S1_Main14_60,"Come on, Your Highness. It'll make you feel good. Heh heh heh..."
E_S1_Main14_61,S-stop!
E_S1_Main14_62,I don't like that look in your eyes!
E_S1_Main15_1,"*Huff, huff...*"
E_S1_Main15_2,"Are you alright, Princess?"
E_S1_Main15_3,"Yes, but..."
E_S1_Main15_4,What about you? You took a few more sips while trying to protect me.
E_S1_Main15_5,Mm...?
E_S1_Main15_6,I'm good.
E_S1_Main15_7,"Actually, I've never felt so good before in my life."
E_S1_Main15_8,"I told you, it's safe for the strong-minded, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main15_9,"Ah, but it might be different in his case."
E_S1_Main15_10,He might be suppressing the potion's effects simply by brute strength.
E_S1_Main15_11,"Excuse me, but how'd you like to participate in my other experiments?"
E_S1_Main15_12,I refuse.
E_S1_Main15_13,My duty is to protect the Princess.
E_S1_Main15_14,"Oh, that's a bit disappointing. Ho ho ho..."
E_S1_Main15_15,*Sigh* You could've made an interesting research subject...
E_S1_Main15_16,"If Chase is okay, then so should I!"
E_S1_Main15_17,"My stomach is used to many different types of health drinks, anyway!"
E_S1_Main15_18,"Master, that's 100% pure toxin."
E_S1_Main15_19,It's dangerous to ingest...
E_S1_Main15_20,*Gulp*
E_S1_Main15_21,!!!!
E_S1_Main15_22,....
E_S1_Main15_23,Mm? It's delicious! So sweet!
E_S1_Main15_24,"Ooh, I can feel the power flowing in me!"
E_S1_Main15_25,"Ah, I don't have time for this. The lab! Yes, I must go to the lab!"
E_S1_Main15_26,"Kara, let's go back to our lab! I've got a new experiment to work on!"
E_S1_Main15_27,Yippee!
E_S1_Main15_28,"She's strong-minded, but in a different sense."
E_S1_Main15_29,"In a way, she resembles Mediana, too."
E_S1_Main15_30,*Sigh...*
E_S1_Main16_1,*Ahem*
E_S1_Main16_2,"Every day has been mayhem since the festival began,"
E_S1_Main16_3,and somehow we've come this far.
E_S1_Main16_4,It's the 4th night. The highlight of the Summer Festival. It's a special event that's perfect for a hot night.
E_S1_Main16_5,A spooky walking course to test your bravery!
E_S1_Main16_6,Bravery?
E_S1_Main16_7,Bravery.
E_S1_Main16_8,Courageous behavior or character.
E_S1_Main16_9,One's ability to overcome fear and stay calm...
E_S1_Main16_10,A-ahem!
E_S1_Main16_11,The dictionary feature I added the other day is working well. Ah hah hah hah...
E_S1_Main16_12,"Master, you shouldn't keep adding all kinds of features to my body..."
E_S1_Main16_13,"Anyway, tonight's bravery test will be taken by groups of people,"
E_S1_Main16_14,just like the water gun competition two days ago.
E_S1_Main16_15,"There are multiple entrances. We should go in through different entrances,"
E_S1_Main16_16,and meet after the bravery test.
E_S1_Main16_17,A-are we doing this in teams of two again?
E_S1_Main16_18,"Hm... Then, can my team spook the people instead?"
E_S1_Main16_19,I want to see how well Kara can spook people.
E_S1_Main16_20,"Mm, that role is already filled."
E_S1_Main16_21,"I'm sorry, but we can't do that."
E_S1_Main16_22,"For now, join the event as normal participants to monitor it."
E_S1_Main16_23,Gah!
E_S1_Main16_24,"Th-then, I'll collect data that way!"
E_S1_Main16_25,"I can find out how to spook Kara, for instance."
E_S1_Main16_26,I'm a machine. I do not think I am capable of being frightened...
E_S1_Main16_27,Am I wrong if I think Annette is moving faster than usual?
E_S1_Main16_28,Mm. She looks like she's in a hurry for some reason.
E_S1_Main16_29,"She's excited, maybe?"
E_S1_Main16_30,Ho ho ho. I disagree.
E_S1_Main16_31,"At least, one of us is going to enjoy the festival tonight."
E_S1_Main17_1,"It's dark, so dark!"
E_S1_Main17_2,How long do I have to walk?
E_S1_Main17_3,"Master, what is it like to be scared?"
E_S1_Main17_4,"Scared? Ah, you mean fear."
E_S1_Main17_5,I can't tell you because I'm not scared.
E_S1_Main17_6,"I-in fact, I can't wait to see how they're going to try to scare me!"
E_S1_Main17_7,"So, you're not agitated. You're excited because of your curiosity, Master?"
E_S1_Main17_8,"Huh? S-sure, you can say that!"
E_S1_Main17_9,Heeek! There's something faint over there!
E_S1_Main17_10,...
E_S1_Main17_11,...??
E_S1_Main17_12,"Mm, what is this?"
E_S1_Main17_13,...
E_S1_Main17_14,*Mumble mumble*
E_S1_Main17_15,It's mumbling something.
E_S1_Main17_16,*Sigh* This happens all the time.
E_S1_Main17_17,"I'm either exorcised or purified,"
E_S1_Main17_18,even though I did nothing wrong to humans.
E_S1_Main17_19,Enough is enough!
E_S1_Main17_20,Enng? Err? Nngg?
E_S1_Main17_21,No... A real ghost!?
E_S1_Main17_22,"Hah hah, hah hah hah. This is a trick, right?"
E_S1_Main17_23,"There's no way such an unscientific thing can happen, right?"
E_S1_Main17_24,Analyzing...
E_S1_Main17_25,I don't detect any vital energy from it. Or magical traces.
E_S1_Main17_26,Constituents: Ectoplasm. This is a real ghost.
E_S1_Main17_27,Heeeeek!?
E_S1_Main17_28,Kwaakkk! Enough is enough!
E_S1_Main17_29,"Tonight, we're taking our revenge!"
E_S1_Main17_30,We'll make the humans pay for ignoring and mistreating us!
E_S1_Main17_31,Starting with you!
E_S1_Main17_32,Wagggghhhh!
E_S1_Main17_33,Kyaaaak!
E_S1_Main17_34,"Are you scared, Master?"
E_S1_Main17_35,"Of course, I am!"
E_S1_Main17_36,It's a ghost! A ghost!
E_S1_Main17_37,Is it your fear that's making your energy circulate so rapidly?
E_S1_Main17_38,Recording this in my database...
E_S1_Main17_39,"I experiment on you, not the other way around!"
E_S1_Main18_1,Kyaaaak!
E_S1_Main18_2,"Mm, everyone seems to be having fun."
E_S1_Main18_3,"By the way, there's nothing much going on here."
E_S1_Main18_4,"We met a few people in monster costumes on our way here,"
E_S1_Main18_5,"and for some reason, they avoided us."
E_S1_Main18_6,I think I know why.
E_S1_Main18_7,?
E_S1_Main18_8,Nothing.
E_S1_Main18_9,"Mm? I see something over there. Other participants, maybe."
E_S1_Main18_10,"Bah, this is boring. I had much more fun barbecuing."
E_S1_Main18_11,"It's no surprise, though. Nothing can scare great Demon Viska."
E_S1_Main18_12,I agree. I don't think there's anything that can scare you Demons.
E_S1_Main18_13,"By the way, I've got a question."
E_S1_Main18_14,That power in your right arm...
E_S1_Main18_15,Where did you get it?
E_S1_Main18_16,"Hm, so you want to know about my arm?"
E_S1_Main18_17,"Well, alright, I'll tell you."
E_S1_Main18_18,It's the power of the cursed blood
E_S1_Main18_19,of the great Demon Lucikiel!
E_S1_Main18_20,...
E_S1_Main18_21,What about you? That arm of yours is radiating some potent darkness energy.
E_S1_Main18_22,"Ah, it's the eye of the ancient monster that faces the truth."
E_S1_Main18_23,I once looked into the Abyss for the sake of my revenge.
E_S1_Main18_24,"And it looked into me, too."
E_S1_Main18_25,...
E_S1_Main18_26,"Geez, good for you."
E_S1_Main18_27,Men are attracted to darkness.
E_S1_Main18_28,Whatever!
E_S1_Main18_29,Let's go farther.
E_S1_Main18_30,"I'm not ready to quit, just yet."
E_S1_Main18_31,....
E_S1_Main18_32,Demons!
E_S1_Main18_33,Kyaaaak!
E_S1_Main18_34,"Geez, you startled..."
E_S1_Main18_35,"Ack, Angels!"
E_S1_Main18_36,"Whoa, let's run!"
E_S1_Main18_37,"They're not edible, smell like doves, and they're extremely annoying!"
E_S1_Main18_38,...
E_S1_Main18_39,Waaaah!
E_S1_Main18_40,Stop attacking! This is unfair!
E_S1_Main18_41,I'm not even a Demon... Wah!
E_S1_Main18_42,"Even if you're a dweller of the earth, you've been tainted by darkness. You are to be exterminated!"
E_S1_Main18_43,"Stop running and fight us, Demons!"
E_S1_Main18_44,....
E_S1_Main18_45,Did we hire Angels
E_S1_Main18_46,to scare any Demons that might decide to join this event?
E_S1_Main18_47,"If we did, I didn't know about it."
E_S1_Main19_1,We lost them.
E_S1_Main19_2,"I don't know what kind of special occasion tonight is, but that anonymous tip was authentic."
E_S1_Main19_3,A day when evil spirits come out to play. This must be Halloween.
E_S1_Main19_4,"I think you're right, Arch."
E_S1_Main19_5,How many do you see?
E_S1_Main19_6,"According to the eye I've planted in the sky,"
E_S1_Main19_7,almost none of the entities here are powerful enough to warrant our attention.
E_S1_Main19_8,Those fleeing Demons are probably the strongest.
E_S1_Main19_9,The rest are as strong as ordinary humans.
E_S1_Main19_10,"By the way, don't the ghosts here look strange to you?"
E_S1_Main19_11,"I tried to purify them with rays of the sun,"
E_S1_Main19_12,"but it didn't work, strangely enough."
E_S1_Main19_13,Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
E_S1_Main19_14,I don't know how many times I've asked this question since the beginning of the Summer Festival this year.
E_S1_Main19_15,"I can see what you're seeing, Princess."
E_S1_Main19_16,The Angels are attacking the people in monster costumes to purify them.
E_S1_Main19_17,...
E_S1_Main19_18,"First it was the Demons, and now it's the Angels."
E_S1_Main19_19,Entities from other worlds are troublesome.
E_S1_Main19_20,What's common sense to us just goes over their heads.
E_S1_Main19_21,....
E_S1_Main19_22,"I don't want to fight the Angels,"
E_S1_Main19_23,but we have no choice.
E_S1_Main19_24,Let's stop them for now. We can talk afterward.
E_S1_Main20_1,This must be your first time to join a human festival.
E_S1_Main20_2,"It's not Halloween. It's the Festival of Bravery, one of many events included in our Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main20_3,They're neither Demons nor evil spirits; they're humans.
E_S1_Main20_4,Please don't be so rough with them.
E_S1_Main20_5,"*Ahem* We made a mistake, human princess."
E_S1_Main20_6,We didn't know this was a festival.
E_S1_Main20_7,But there were Demons and some others that have their power.
E_S1_Main20_8,"I'm not trying to take sides with the Demons, but they said they were not in the Dark Legion."
E_S1_Main20_9,They were only here to enjoy the festival.
E_S1_Main20_10,They didn't hurt any of my people.
E_S1_Main20_11,"I'd like to ask you to refrain from any act of hostility, at least for the duration of this festival."
E_S1_Main20_12,"So, you want peace during the festival."
E_S1_Main20_13,"I understand, human princess."
E_S1_Main20_14,This is your country.
E_S1_Main20_15,It's only right that we follow your rules.
E_S1_Main20_16,Understood.
E_S1_Main20_17,Mm? The Eye of Heaven has detected something...
E_S1_Main20_18,A tremendous amount of spiritual energy!? It's coming our way!
E_S1_Main20_19,?!
E_S1_Main20_20,Kyaaaak!
E_S1_Main20_21,NOOOOO!
E_S1_Main20_22,Kyaaaaaaahhh... (Monotonous)
E_S1_Main20_23,"Are you making fun of me now, Kara!?"
E_S1_Main20_24,"Not at all, Master."
E_S1_Main20_25,I was only trying to study fear.
E_S1_Main20_26,I think you are!
E_S1_Main20_27,I'm only mimicking you.
E_S1_Main20_28,I've been recording data.
E_S1_Main20_29,Stop experimenting on me!
E_S1_Main20_30,Real ghosts!?
E_S1_Main20_31,Where did they come from?
E_S1_Main20_32,It's one thing after another with this year's festival. *Sigh*
E_S1_Main20_33,"I can't protect you against your own mental stress, Princess."
E_S1_Main20_34,I'm sorry.
E_S1_Main20_35,"It's not your fault, Chase."
E_S1_Main20_36,"Can we take care of that evil spirit, Princess?"
E_S1_Main20_37,"Yes, you can. Thank you."
E_S1_Main21_1,"Demons, Angels, and now an army of ghosts that came out of nowhere."
E_S1_Main21_2,This year's festival is really eventful.
E_S1_Main21_3,"Whew, that scared the hell out of me."
E_S1_Main21_4,Who knew real ghosts were there?
E_S1_Main21_5,"By the way, those ghosts weren't part of the plan, were they?"
E_S1_Main21_6,"I don't know if this was a prank or not,"
E_S1_Main21_7,but let's collect ourselves and prepare for the next event.
E_S1_Main21_8,The main event for today also takes place at night.
E_S1_Main21_9,"It's a full-scale fireworks show,"
E_S1_Main21_10,called the Festival of Fireworks!
E_S1_Main21_11,"Ah, fireworks?"
E_S1_Main21_12,Like we did in the beginning of this year?
E_S1_Main21_13,I loved them so much that I added them to Kara.
E_S1_Main21_14,I wonder what you didn't add to Kara.
E_S1_Main21_15,"By the way, I really hope nothing bad will happen tonight..."
E_S1_Main21_16,Your Highness! Your Highness! Bad news!
E_S1_Main21_17,Mm? What is it?
E_S1_Main21_18,The fireworks and extra explosives we prepared for tonight's fireworks show...
E_S1_Main21_19,They've been stolen!
E_S1_Main21_20,...
E_S1_Main21_21,Now I'm convinced that Lua has cursed this year's festival.
E_S1_Main21_22,"Cheer up, Princess."
E_S1_Main21_23,We'll be able to handle this as well.
E_S1_Main22_1,"Traces of wheels, but of no hooves."
E_S1_Main22_2,The thieves used some form of mechanical transport to move them.
E_S1_Main22_3,"There are footprints, too."
E_S1_Main22_4,Small footprints... Possibly of young humans or of a different race.
E_S1_Main22_5,Aren't they goblins'?
E_S1_Main22_6,I've heard more goblins live in the King's Plains than we think.
E_S1_Main22_7,You may be right.
E_S1_Main22_8,"But it's hard to believe that ordinary goblins came this far,"
E_S1_Main22_9,"put our guards to sleep, and left with such a large amount of"
E_S1_Main22_10,explosives and fireworks.
E_S1_Main22_11,"According to my database, the goblins have a penchant for explosives."
E_S1_Main22_12,That's good enough reason for them to steal ours.
E_S1_Main22_13,And this wheel marking...
E_S1_Main22_14,It's in my database.
E_S1_Main22_15,I've seen it during the water gun competition on the second day of the festival.
E_S1_Main22_16,"Oh, that girl who carried the cannon with her, right?"
E_S1_Main22_17,The self-proclaimed Pirate Empress.
E_S1_Main22_18,"Hm, judging by the spacing of the wheels, I think you're right."
E_S1_Main22_19,"Then, the thieves are that girl named Miruru"
E_S1_Main22_20,"and her goblin partner, Lakrak."
E_S1_Main22_21,But why?
E_S1_Main23_1,Bwa hah! Good explosives!
E_S1_Main23_2,I can make best bomb with them!
E_S1_Main23_3,Keh heh heh. Good!
E_S1_Main23_4,"I'll show you the power from my past,"
E_S1_Main23_5,"Miruru's custom cannon, Leviathan Mark 2!"
E_S1_Main23_6,You good human!
E_S1_Main23_7,No human loves bomb is bad!
E_S1_Main23_8,I wish Roi love bomb like you!
E_S1_Main23_9,Roi? That name sounds familiar...
E_S1_Main23_10,"Err, whatever. It can't be important."
E_S1_Main23_11,"Come on, let's make bombs!"
E_S1_Main23_12,That must be them.
E_S1_Main23_13,What are they doing?
E_S1_Main23_14,A gigantic cannon.
E_S1_Main23_15,And a mountain of bombs.
E_S1_Main23_16,"Kara, activate your night vision and zoom in on them."
E_S1_Main23_17,See anything?
E_S1_Main23_18,Activating night vision. Zooming in...
E_S1_Main23_19,I see them.
E_S1_Main23_20,They're putting the explosives and fireworks into something that looks like a gigantic clay ball.
E_S1_Main23_21,"Judging by the fuse on the side of the ball, I believe it's an oversized bomb."
E_S1_Main23_22,"So, they're making oversized bombs."
E_S1_Main23_23,"Whatever their reason is,"
E_S1_Main23_24,we should stop them first!
E_S1_Main24_1,"Woo hee, woo hee hee! It's ready."
E_S1_Main24_2,Right! Kuhehek! Finally it's completed!
E_S1_Main24_3,Now load these bombs in Leviathan Mark 2 and shoot them at once...
E_S1_Main24_4,Humans in Orvel Castle will be so surprised! Bwa hah!
E_S1_Main24_5,Halt!
E_S1_Main24_6,Ugyak!?
E_S1_Main24_7,Ack? What? What?
E_S1_Main24_8,You're under arrest for stealing those explosives and fireworks.
E_S1_Main24_9,Don't move.
E_S1_Main24_10,Gyaaak! Screw you!
E_S1_Main24_11,No one can stop our experiment!
E_S1_Main24_12,He's right!
E_S1_Main24_13,"This is a crucial moment, so don't interfere!"
E_S1_Main24_14,We're about to rewrite the history of bombs!
E_S1_Main24_15,"Okay, what kind of experiment is it?"
E_S1_Main24_16,Not going to tell you!
E_S1_Main24_17,It's confidential!
E_S1_Main24_18,"Oh, come on."
E_S1_Main24_19,"You're trying to blow something off, right?"
E_S1_Main24_20,No means no!
E_S1_Main24_21,Where's the fun in telling you?
E_S1_Main24_22,She's right. No fun telling you!
E_S1_Main24_23,Even if this is going to be the world's biggest explosion!
E_S1_Main24_24,"Alright, if you're not going to talk,"
E_S1_Main24_25,we'll have to use force to make you talk.
E_S1_Main25_1,Argh! That hurts! Stop!
E_S1_Main25_2,Hnngg...
E_S1_Main25_3,"Now, give up and spill!"
E_S1_Main25_4,Those explosives are for tonight's fireworks show.
E_S1_Main25_5,Why did you steal them?
E_S1_Main25_6,"Sheesh, why, you ask?"
E_S1_Main25_7,"Because ordinary fireworks are boring. We wanted to improve them,"
E_S1_Main25_8,making them go off multiple times instead of just once!
E_S1_Main25_9,We no need ordinary fireworks!
E_S1_Main25_10,"We wanted the prize money from the water gun competition, but we didn't win."
E_S1_Main25_11,One great step toward a new explosion!
E_S1_Main25_12,What?
E_S1_Main25_13,"In other words, you're not satisfied with the usual fireworks show in Orvel, right?"
E_S1_Main25_14,Yes! / Right!
E_S1_Main25_15,"Heh heh heh, then I've got a great idea."
E_S1_Main25_16,"Your Highness, can I have these kids for a while?"
E_S1_Main25_17,I'll take care of the fireworks event.
E_S1_Main25_18,...
E_S1_Main25_19,"If you're so sure, I'll leave these two under your custody, Annette."
E_S1_Main25_20,"I'll trust you with tonight's event, too."
E_S1_Main25_21,"Let's go, Chase."
E_S1_Main25_22,"Alright, then..."
E_S1_Main25_23,It's time for a fun experiment!
E_S1_Main25_24,"Annette, I don't know what you're trying to do,"
E_S1_Main25_25,but it's about time the fireworks show began.
E_S1_Main25_26,"Princess, look."
E_S1_Main25_27,There are thousands of balls in the sky.
E_S1_Main25_28,Oooh!
E_S1_Main25_29,This is fun! Heh heh heh!
E_S1_Main25_30,Ready?
E_S1_Main25_31,The cannon's ready.
E_S1_Main25_32,Leviathan Mark 2 is in place.
E_S1_Main25_33,"Filled with explosives, too!"
E_S1_Main25_34,Just need to charge it with a bit more energy!
E_S1_Main25_35,"Kara, feed it some energy."
E_S1_Main25_36,"Got it, Master."
E_S1_Main25_37,Energy fully charged.
E_S1_Main25_38,FIRE!!!!!
E_S1_Main25_39,Wow!
E_S1_Main25_40,"This is the biggest, most spectacular fireworks show I've ever seen! Heh heh!"
E_S1_Main25_41,Ho ho ho...
E_S1_Main25_42,This is the power of Miruru's cannon!
E_S1_Main25_43,...
E_S1_Main25_44,Art...
E_S1_Main25_45,There is art in explosion.
E_S1_Main25_46,How beautiful!
E_S1_Main25_47,"Hah hah hah. They deserve a prize, not punishment."
E_S1_Main25_48,"Not a day went by without some kind of trouble,"
E_S1_Main25_49,but I'm glad this happened today.
E_S1_Main25_50,"Hah hah. I'm glad too, Princess."
E_S1_Main25_51,"By the way, those fireworks... They're not getting any weaker."
E_S1_Main25_52,How long do they last?
E_S1_Main25_53,2 hours later
E_S1_Main25_54,They're still going strong.
E_S1_Main25_55,Infinite fireworks.
E_S1_Main25_56,"Let's go, Chase."
E_S1_Main25_57,"It figures, today was not an exception."
E_S1_Main25_58,Hah hah hah.
E_S1_Main26_1,"*Ahem* We had a hard time getting rid of those never-ending fireworks,"
E_S1_Main26_2,but everything else went exceptionally well yesterday.
E_S1_Main26_3,"Heh heh. Sorry, sorry. I might have gone overboard with them."
E_S1_Main26_4,Hah hah hah. But they were beautiful.
E_S1_Main26_5,"Everyone was happy, and that's what matters."
E_S1_Main26_6,"Now, today is the last day of the festival. To celebrate its last night,"
E_S1_Main26_7,"we'll hold the Festival of Music, a party around the last campfire of the festival."
E_S1_Main26_8,"It'll be a night of the arts, with dancing and singing."
E_S1_Main26_9,"Ack, dance..."
E_S1_Main26_10,"Mm? Annette, do you have a bad dancing experience?"
E_S1_Main26_11,Ah hah hah. Kind of?
E_S1_Main26_12,I've never had a good dancing experience...
E_S1_Main26_13,The Master just doesn't know how to dance.
E_S1_Main26_14,She just has no rhythm in her body.
E_S1_Main26_15,Hush!
E_S1_Main26_16,Hah hah hah. Perhaps I can hire a dance instructor for you later.
E_S1_Main26_17,"But this night, you're not required to dance certain styles."
E_S1_Main26_18,You can just dance however you like.
E_S1_Main26_19,"So, you don't need to worry at all."
E_S1_Main26_20,The Master doesn't even know how to just move her bod... euppp! Eupp!
E_S1_Main26_21,Kara dances better than I do. I'll let her dance for me!
E_S1_Main26_22,Anyhoo!
E_S1_Main26_23,"It's the last event of this festival, so you want us to take special care of it, right?"
E_S1_Main26_24,"How do we supervise events like this, anyway?"
E_S1_Main26_25,"Being the last event of the festival, it should go smoothly, so long as no one tries to stir up trouble."
E_S1_Main26_26,"Of course, that'll hardly be the case, given our record so far."
E_S1_Main26_27,"This has been hard on you, Princess."
E_S1_Main26_28,I recommend you take break from work for a while after this festival.
E_S1_Main26_29,Hah hah.
E_S1_Main26_30,I'll think about it.
E_S1_Main26_31,"Then, shall we go?"
E_S1_Main27_1,Hello. Welcome to the Festival of Music
E_S1_Main27_2,on the last night of the Orvel Summer Festival.
E_S1_Main27_3,"For this year's Summer Festival, Orvel Guild Alliance has prepared many things in collaboration with the Palace."
E_S1_Main27_4,Thank you all for participating in the festival so far.
E_S1_Main27_5,"I hope you'll enjoy tonight,"
E_S1_Main27_6,"the last night of the festival, until the end."
E_S1_Main27_7,"Finally, it's begun."
E_S1_Main27_8,*Sigh* I really hope nothing happens tonight.
E_S1_Main27_9,"So far, your hope has been futile."
E_S1_Main27_10,"But things worked out on their own, didn't they? Heh heh."
E_S1_Main27_11,"That's not what I want, anyway. I want to see Kara dance."
E_S1_Main27_12,"Master, when can I stop?"
E_S1_Main27_13,People are looking at me.
E_S1_Main27_14,Not now!
E_S1_Main27_15,I'm measuring your response to other people's attention to you.
E_S1_Main27_16,"For accurate results, you'll have to dance for at least 10 more minutes."
E_S1_Main27_17,"Understood, Master."
E_S1_Main27_18,Can I at least change my dancing speed?
E_S1_Main27_19,"You can speed up, if you want!"
E_S1_Main27_20,"By the way, what kind of dance is that?"
E_S1_Main27_21,I've never seen it before.
E_S1_Main27_22,"Ah, neither have I,"
E_S1_Main27_23,but I think it's from that past technomagic civilization.
E_S1_Main27_24,I had her just follow what's left in her data.
E_S1_Main27_25,I must say the people of old times danced in a peculiar way.
E_S1_Main27_26,"Chase, do you know any dance styles?"
E_S1_Main27_27,I may have known how to dance in the past.
E_S1_Main27_28,I don't remember now.
E_S1_Main27_29,"Hm, I shouldn't have asked."
E_S1_Main27_30,"I'm sorry, Chase."
E_S1_Main27_31,"Don't worry about it, Princess."
E_S1_Main27_32,"By the way, shouldn't we check the other areas?"
E_S1_Main27_33,"Mm, you're right."
E_S1_Main27_34,"Annette, I'll leave this side to you."
E_S1_Main27_35,We'll watch the festival from the other side of the Plaza.
E_S1_Main27_36,Okie dokie.
E_S1_Main28_1,"A lot of things happened, but we were able to go through with every event we planned."
E_S1_Main28_2,"Seriously, it was one surprise after another. It was exciting, though."
E_S1_Main28_3,Your country is full of oddballs.
E_S1_Main28_4,"I wonder if where I used to live was like this, too."
E_S1_Main28_5,People are the same wherever you go.
E_S1_Main28_6,"If you get your memories back, I'd love to see you dance and sing like the people of your country do."
E_S1_Main28_7,"Sure. I'd love that, too."
E_S1_Main28_8,"By the way, aren't you going to sing and dance, Princess?"
E_S1_Main28_9,Hah hah. Want to see?
E_S1_Main28_10,I don't think you'll like it.
E_S1_Main28_11,I'm not asking for my sake.
E_S1_Main28_12,"Princess, you need to relax sometimes, like everyone else."
E_S1_Main28_13,You haven't taken any breaks throughout this entire event.
E_S1_Main28_14,Hah hah. Neither did you.
E_S1_Main28_15,...
E_S1_Main29_1,Hm... This is different from the Empire's festivals in many ways.
E_S1_Main29_2,"Don't you agree, Cassandra Golding? As the owner of the Gold Bar, you should know."
E_S1_Main29_3,Ho ho. I'm surprised to meet a Royal Knight in a place like this.
E_S1_Main29_4,You're a long way from home. Who's your charge today?
E_S1_Main29_5,Hah hah. I'm sure you already know.
E_S1_Main29_6,You have eyes that captivate people and see through them.
E_S1_Main29_7,You know what's happening in the seedier side of the Empire better than anyone else.
E_S1_Main29_8,"Oh, so you know."
E_S1_Main29_9,"So, what brings you to me, Knight of the Fluttering Blade?"
E_S1_Main29_10,Nothing.
E_S1_Main29_11,"I just came here, following a familiar melody."
E_S1_Main29_12,Ho ho ho. I'm the owner of a bar for a reason.
E_S1_Main29_13,I'm next to none when it comes to singing and dancing.
E_S1_Main29_14,Hah hah. So am I.
E_S1_Main29_15,I'm good at singing and dancing in the Imperial style.
E_S1_Main29_16,How about we see who's better?
E_S1_Main29_17,Ho ho. Sure.
E_S1_Main29_18,"I'm not just going to let you win. You'd better do your best, Sir Knight."
E_S1_Main29_19,....
E_S1_Main29_20,I hear... something familiar...
E_S1_Main29_21,Hm?
E_S1_Main29_22,"What's going on, Chase?"
E_S1_Main29_23,...
E_S1_Main29_24,...?
E_S1_Main30_1,....
E_S1_Main30_2,"Chase, wait! Where are you going... Hm?"
E_S1_Main30_3,"Oh, more people came to watch us."
E_S1_Main30_4,Do you like listening to me singing so much?
E_S1_Main30_5,Mm? He's...
E_S1_Main30_6,Hm? Do you know him?
E_S1_Main30_7,Ho ho. Nothing.
E_S1_Main30_8,I'm just flattered to have such a handsome man
E_S1_Main30_9,listen to me singing with such a rapt look on his face.
E_S1_Main30_10,"You're such a smooth talker, if nothing else."
E_S1_Main30_11,This melody is... familiar.
E_S1_Main30_12,But... I can't remember...
E_S1_Main30_13,Chase!
E_S1_Main30_14,"Ah, Princess."
E_S1_Main30_15,What happened?
E_S1_Main30_16,You just up and left all of a sudden.
E_S1_Main30_17,Nothing.
E_S1_Main30_18,I thought I was remembering something... I don't know yet.
E_S1_Main30_19,...?
E_S1_Main30_20,Did you find some clue to your memories?
E_S1_Main30_21,I don't know...
E_S1_Main30_22,But that's not important.
E_S1_Main30_23,"My duty is to protect you, Princess."
E_S1_Main30_24,I'm sorry I left you defenseless.
E_S1_Main30_25,"Alright, if you say so."
E_S1_Main30_26,The festival is almost over. Let's go join Annette.
E_S1_Main30_27,Got it.
E_S1_Main30_28,...
E_S1_Main30_29,The Empire...?
E_S1_Main30_30,"Hm, I'd better check after the festival..."
E_S1_Main30_31,Your Highneeeess!
E_S1_Main30_32,What is it?
E_S1_Main30_33,Some Demons have shown up at the stalls! They're gorging on the food!
E_S1_Main30_34,Some goblin threw those never-ending fireworks into the campfire!
E_S1_Main30_35,....
E_S1_Main30_36,"This isn't going to end, is it? Hah hah hah."
E_S1_Main30_37,"Let's go, Chase. With this festival, it's just one thing after another!"
E_S1_Main30_38,"Such is fate, I suppose."
E_H2_Main_0_1,Urgh!
E_H2_Main_0_2,Kyaa!
E_H2_Main_0_3,Argh! What kind of place is this!?
E_H2_Main_0_4,"Umm, this smell..."
E_H2_Main_0_5,"You, Crab Legs! Get off from me!"
E_H2_Main_0_6,You're heavy!
E_H2_Main_0_7,"Oh, you were there?"
E_H2_Main_0_8,It's surprising that you're so bulky and yet so hard to notice.
E_H2_Main_0_9,What are you talking about?
E_H2_Main_0_10,You knew I was down here!
E_H2_Main_0_11,"Keh heh, you got me."
E_H2_Main_0_12,Well. We shouldn't let ourselves get bothered by little things.
E_H2_Main_0_13,What's important is that we are summoned by some creepy woman.
E_H2_Main_0_14,"Haha. Words hurt, you know!"
E_H2_Main_0_15,I don't remember doing anything to offend you.
E_H2_Main_0_16,Nonsense!
E_H2_Main_0_17,I said it because I can't get what you are thinking!
E_H2_Main_0_18,"And then, there's your soul!"
E_H2_Main_0_19,"It's the curse in its primal form, and I can't even eat it!"
E_H2_Main_0_20,You can't understand how frustrated I am.
E_H2_Main_0_21,"I'm standing in front of such a powerful Demon, and I can't even eat it!"
E_H2_Main_0_22,"Haha, I'm pretty disappointed."
E_H2_Main_0_23,"You don't have the power or the confidence to even endure this curse,"
E_H2_Main_0_24,but you're still aiming to be the Dark Lord.
E_H2_Main_0_25,"Maybe that power let you crawl out from the bottom of the Pandemonium, but I guess that's as far as it goes."
E_H2_Main_0_26,"You're ridiculous, Little Demon of Gluttony. Oh, right! You call yourself a Great Demon, don't you? *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_0_27,What the!? You...
E_H2_Main_0_28,I don't know who you are or what you're talking about.
E_H2_Main_0_29,But everything that's coming out of your mouth is nonsense. Do you want to die?
E_H2_Main_0_30,"Haha, dear, you're not much better than I am, Blue Demon's child."
E_H2_Main_0_31,"Sure, you've got the power of the great Demon, Lucikiel, and the limitless potential of a human."
E_H2_Main_0_32,You really are quite a miraculous child.
E_H2_Main_0_33,"However... By denying your own existence, you can't even use your true strength."
E_H2_Main_0_34,"The blood in you is so special and blessed, it's pathetic you're not even using it."
E_H2_Main_0_35,Wh-what!? Pathetic?
E_H2_Main_0_36,How can you say that? What do you even know about me?
E_H2_Main_0_37,"Haha, Well. What do I know about you?"
E_H2_Main_0_38,Maybe I know that you're close to a child from the Republic of Gray.
E_H2_Main_0_39,"Or maybe, I'm familiar with the story about Lucikiel?"
E_H2_Main_0_40,I see.
E_H2_Main_0_41,"You're Shamilla, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_0_42,You're the Demon that Epis told me about!
E_H2_Main_0_43,What in the world have you done to Theo?
E_H2_Main_0_44,"Haha, I just made a contract with him."
E_H2_Main_0_45,"On the day his princess revives, his eyes will open."
E_H2_Main_0_46,"I put two curses on him, petrification and freeze, and turned him into a statue guarding the coffin of the princess."
E_H2_Main_0_47,"If he were an ordinary human, the passage of time would have already turned him to dust."
E_H2_Main_0_48,"I'm sure that would have been nice to watch, a child stubbornly fighting fate and crumbling away in vain..."
E_H2_Main_0_49,But his determination touched the heart of the Divine Beast and gave birth to a great force of life.
E_H2_Main_0_50,"Ahhh, that unexpected energy of blazing human emotion and spirit..."
E_H2_Main_0_51,That was much more fun to watch! Ahhh...
E_H2_Main_0_52,You disgust me...
E_H2_Main_0_53,"Haha, again. What hurtful words."
E_H2_Main_0_54,I am the one that has hidden him from Malduk and cured him from petrification.
E_H2_Main_0_55,"I've also kept his princess, Jane Grey, from becoming Malduk's plaything and brought her soul to awakening."
E_H2_Main_0_56,...???
E_H2_Main_0_57,"Haha, I can let you meet her if you like."
E_H2_Main_0_58,She should be with that Succubus by now.
E_H2_Main_0_59,Let's bring them here. What do you say?
E_H2_Main_0_60,What?
E_H2_Main_0_61,Kyaa!
E_H2_Main_0_62,Zzz... Umm?
E_H2_Main_0_63,"Urgh, What the hell!?"
E_H2_Main_0_64,I was having this nice dream... Huh!?
E_H2_Main_0_65,Shamilla?
E_H2_Main_0_66,"It's been a long time, Epis."
E_H2_Main_0_67,"As always, you're enjoying your freedom, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_0_68,....
E_H2_Main_0_69,"Jane! Wake up, Jane!"
E_H2_Main_0_70,We need to run now!
E_H2_Main_0_71,We've got to get away from this evil witch!
E_H2_Main_0_72,Epis? And... Jane!?
E_H2_Main_0_73,She should be the one Theo was looking for...!
E_H2_Main_0_74,"Haha, witch? Well, that's not wrong, I suppose."
E_H2_Main_0_75,"Anyway, let me tell you the reason why I brought you all here."
E_H2_Main_0_76,I need you to do me a favor.
E_H2_Main_0_77,???
E_H2_Main_0_78,What are you talking about?
E_H2_Main_0_79,Zzzz...
E_H2_Main_0_80,"Well, you'll get the full explanation later."
E_H2_Main_0_81,"But first, I should put you two to sleep for now."
E_H2_Main_0_82,...!!!
E_H2_Main_0_83,Ugh...!
E_H2_Main_0_84,I can't...
E_H2_Main_1_1,Ummmmm...
E_H2_Main_1_2,Uh!?
E_H2_Main_1_3,"Haha, it worked pretty well."
E_H2_Main_1_4,I've put a curse on both of you to keep your Demon sides in check.
E_H2_Main_1_5,That part of you will be asleep for a while.
E_H2_Main_1_6,Don't you think that's a little too much?
E_H2_Main_1_7,"I don't like demons too, but this one has been taking care of me after saving my life."
E_H2_Main_1_8,She even lets me take control of my body from time to time.
E_H2_Main_1_9,That's quite... different.
E_H2_Main_1_10,The Demon blood in me...
E_H2_Main_1_11,"Once it takes control, it won't let go, no matter what."
E_H2_Main_1_12,"Phew, it's been a long time since I had any control over this body. Thank you."
E_H2_Main_1_13,"Haha, that was the whole point of the curse."
E_H2_Main_1_14,It's a temporary suppression. The demon in you isn't fully sealed away.
E_H2_Main_1_15,"If you help me, I'll release you from the curse."
E_H2_Main_1_16,"Of course, if you like, you can keep the curse and have control over it as well. *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_1_17,....
E_H2_Main_1_18,"Haha, I can tell you've got your doubts right now."
E_H2_Main_1_19,Don't worry. I won't ask you to hurt or kill anyone.
E_H2_Main_1_20,I'll also give you something in return for your help after everything's done.
E_H2_Main_1_21,Perhaps I could provide you with a way to better control the Demon powers...
E_H2_Main_1_22,...!!!
E_H2_Main_1_23,...Okay.
E_H2_Main_1_24,...
E_H2_Main_1_25,"Are you leaving already, Epis? It's still a bit early, isn't it?"
E_H2_Main_1_26,I want to ask you to do something as well.
E_H2_Main_1_27,"Psh, you really got me good, didn't you?"
E_H2_Main_1_28,"Well, I know I can't leave Jane here alone."
E_H2_Main_1_29,...?
E_H2_Main_1_30,...Something about this magical energy is familiar.
E_H2_Main_1_31,"Oh, you remember me? How sweet!"
E_H2_Main_1_32,*Giggle* What an adorable undead lady you are.
E_H2_Main_1_33,"So, what do you want?"
E_H2_Main_1_34,Let's get this over with! I can't bear to be with you for too long. You make me feel sick.
E_H2_Main_1_35,"Oh, there's no reason for you to be like that."
E_H2_Main_1_36,It's easy for you to say. You're not the one that's had to suffer.
E_H2_Main_1_37,"Haha, why, didn't you have fun?"
E_H2_Main_1_38,"But don't worry, Epis. This time won't be too difficult."
E_H2_Main_1_39,Let me just say there's a need to do some ghost-hunting.
E_H2_Main_1_40,How easy does that sound?
E_H2_Main_1_41,Your 'easy' always means a disaster for me.
E_H2_Main_1_42,"Haha, really? Hmmm, I can't help but wonder why."
E_H2_Main_1_43,"Urgh, your words are really messing with my head."
E_H2_Main_1_44,*Giggle* Your hostility against me only makes me want to tease you more.
E_H2_Main_1_45,"Well, enough chatting for today."
E_H2_Main_1_46,"Now, take these clothes and put them on, please."
E_H2_Main_1_47,This should help you attract evil spirits.
E_H2_Main_1_48,...?
E_H2_Main_1_49,Wait! What in the world is this?
E_H2_Main_2_1,"Anything else, I could understand, but this...!?"
E_H2_Main_2_2,Why should I dress like an angel?
E_H2_Main_2_3,And why do these keep sticking around me?
E_H2_Main_2_4,"Haha, evil spirits aren't actually scared of angels."
E_H2_Main_2_5,Purification is a means of salvation to souls in agony.
E_H2_Main_2_6,They'll lunge at you unless they have something better to do.
E_H2_Main_2_7,"I wouldn't worry about the others, but Epis, you shouldn't fight back against them."
E_H2_Main_2_8,They'll figure out that you're not one of the angels.
E_H2_Main_2_9,"Urgh, what kind of torture is this, getting beaten around by these weak spirits?"
E_H2_Main_2_10,"And you! You're dressed like an angel, too!"
E_H2_Main_2_11,Why aren't these things lunging at you at all?
E_H2_Main_2_12,"Oh, this isn't what angels wear. It looks awfully similar, though, huh?"
E_H2_Main_2_13,It's the look of that fairy of love from those old folktales... I think he was called Cupid?
E_H2_Main_2_14,"It suits me if you think about it. I'm playing a matchmaker between Theo and Jane, a couple that's spent such a long time away from each other."
E_H2_Main_2_15,...
E_H2_Main_2_16,"Psh, I was a fool to ask you that."
E_H2_Main_2_17,"I can see why Jane is a mummy since she's... well, undead."
E_H2_Main_2_18,But why are these two animals?
E_H2_Main_2_19,*Giggle* Don't you agree that they look adorable in those animal costumes?
E_H2_Main_2_20,"I chose those after taking everything, from their characters and battle styles, into consideration."
E_H2_Main_2_21,What about me? Did you bring this just to make me look funny?
E_H2_Main_2_22,"Oh no, Epis. You are just very angel-like."
E_H2_Main_2_23,You're call a Demon angel-like? That's practically an insult.
E_H2_Main_2_24,By the way... Those two seem to be having a hard time fighting with their Demon sides suppressed.
E_H2_Main_2_25,My curse shouldn't keep them from using their powers... I guess they need more time to get used to it.
E_H2_Main_2_26,"I can see that the girl holding the Demon of Gluttony inside is trying to fight,"
E_H2_Main_2_27,but Lucikiel's child is refusing to accept the power in his blood out of fear.
E_H2_Main_2_28,"Argh, what is this?"
E_H2_Main_2_29,I don't feel as strong as I should be.
E_H2_Main_2_30,I was much better than this when I was in control...
E_H2_Main_2_31,"Grrr, kugh..."
E_H2_Main_2_32,I can't seem to use my powers very well.
E_H2_Main_2_33,I'm sorry for being a burden for you two.
E_H2_Main_2_34,....
E_H2_Main_2_35,"Anyway, it's quite amazing."
E_H2_Main_2_36,How can she fight so well with such a slender build?
E_H2_Main_2_37,Her name was...Jane? Jane...
E_H2_Main_2_38,The name sounds very familiar... I must have heard it before...
E_H2_Main_2_39,I guess I heard it when the other side of me was in control. I can't seem to remember.
E_H2_Main_2_40,She looks about the same age as me. How did she end up becoming an undead?
E_H2_Main_2_41,"Ah, come to think of it, the same thing almost happened to me as well."
E_H2_Main_2_42,"Oh, right. It's our first time meeting each other while I'm me."
E_H2_Main_2_43,I believe you know the other side of me pretty well...
E_H2_Main_2_44,Right...
E_H2_Main_2_45,"The other side of me always pulls pranks and makes fun of you, doesn't she?"
E_H2_Main_2_46,I'm sorry...
E_H2_Main_2_47,"Ahhahaha. No worries. She's been doing that to the other side of me, so no hard feelings."
E_H2_Main_2_48,"Well, personally, Viska... Umm... Actually, I don't know what to call you. Hahaha."
E_H2_Main_2_49,My name...
E_H2_Main_2_50,I don't actually remember it.
E_H2_Main_2_51,"But, yes. It'll be a little bit awkward without one."
E_H2_Main_2_52,"Then... Uh, just call me Vi."
E_H2_Main_2_53,"Call me Vi, please."
E_H2_Main_2_54,That should do it.
E_H2_Main_2_55,"Alright, Vi."
E_H2_Main_2_56,Hahaha...
E_H2_Main_2_57,Hahaha...
E_H2_Main_2_58,...
E_H2_Main_2_59,Kyaaaa!
E_H2_Main_2_60,Stop it with the chitchat! Can I get a little help here?
E_H2_Main_2_61,I can't fight right now!
E_H2_Main_3_1,"Grrr, Kugh..."
E_H2_Main_3_2,This... This isn't right!
E_H2_Main_3_3,"Haha, are you tired already?"
E_H2_Main_3_4,We barely got started.
E_H2_Main_3_5,Argh!
E_H2_Main_3_6,"Uh, what's that?"
E_H2_Main_3_7,"Umm, they're exuding dark energy that's much stronger than before."
E_H2_Main_3_8,Wait. Are they actually in human bodies?
E_H2_Main_3_9,"Haha, those are the ones I was looking for."
E_H2_Main_3_10,"Now, here's what we'll have to do today."
E_H2_Main_3_11,"Simply put, it's an exorcism,"
E_H2_Main_3_12,expelling higher evil spirits from those human bodies.
E_H2_Main_3_13,...?
E_H2_Main_3_14,"Huh? It's something really different from what I've thought it would be. This kind of work doesn't suit you, either."
E_H2_Main_3_15,Those higher evil spirits are actually astral composites created by aggregations of lost souls.
E_H2_Main_3_16,"They are the curse itself formed, from all things that are corrupt and evil in every corner of the world."
E_H2_Main_3_17,With enough time and power gathered in them...
E_H2_Main_3_18,"They will be a great threat to the material world, especially to the living."
E_H2_Main_3_19,...Wait.
E_H2_Main_3_20,The incident that created those things...
E_H2_Main_3_21,"Yes, they are the evil spirits of the highest rank, formed 100 years ago during the Demon War."
E_H2_Main_3_22,"They all have different characteristics, which makes them unpredictable and interesting."
E_H2_Main_3_23,"Umm, they could pose a serious threat to those who don't know anything about them."
E_H2_Main_3_24,That's right.
E_H2_Main_3_25,Those who come out to enjoy Halloween might be caught unaware and get possessed by them.
E_H2_Main_3_26,"Well, honestly, it's not something that I need to deal with myself,"
E_H2_Main_3_27,"but I felt that something very fun would happen today, haha."
E_H2_Main_3_28,"What, wait!"
E_H2_Main_3_29,"You could actually deal with this one your own, couldn't you?"
E_H2_Main_3_30,Why in the world did you bring all of us...?
E_H2_Main_3_31,I just told you. I felt that something fun would happen.
E_H2_Main_3_32,I shouldn't keep all the fun to myself. *Giggle*
E_H2_Main_3_33,"Well, I enjoy fun things as much as anyone else,"
E_H2_Main_3_34,but I feel there's huge difference in our definition of 'fun.'
E_H2_Main_3_35,"Don't think too deeply on it. Just consider this a nice, memorable event."
E_H2_Main_3_36,And a good memory always takes place in a peculiar setting. Haha.
E_H2_Main_3_37,"I never understand what you're saying, and I pretty much hate you. Maria is the only reason I'm putting up with you."
E_H2_Main_3_38,That 100 year-old friendship... *Sigh*
E_H2_Main_3_39,I don't understand why Maria likes you when all you have is vague information that drags people into weird stuff.
E_H2_Main_3_40,"I mean, really. Can you ever tell us something directly?"
E_H2_Main_3_41,"Like, the reason why Theo and Jane are so important in the plan you're forming with Maria!"
E_H2_Main_3_42,"I'm fine with taking care of Jane because it's fun, but I want to be free sometimes!"
E_H2_Main_3_43,"You're already as free as a bird, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_3_44,I've heard that you disappear sometimes while Jane's left alone.
E_H2_Main_3_45,"*Cough, cough*"
E_H2_Main_3_46,"Well, I'll let it slide. But please, be patient for a little while."
E_H2_Main_3_47,"It won't be long until the curtain closes the first act, haha."
E_H2_Main_3_48,It's been 100 years. A little while is not a problem for me.
E_H2_Main_3_49,*Sigh*
E_H2_Main_4_1,"Haha, are you getting better at using your powers?"
E_H2_Main_4_2,"Well, I'm not sure yet."
E_H2_Main_4_3,Compared to the times when I've taken control in ordinary situations...
E_H2_Main_4_4,My body feels heavier and harder to control.
E_H2_Main_4_5,This really does feel weird.
E_H2_Main_4_6,I haven't tried to use my powers by myself before.
E_H2_Main_4_7,I've never even thought about how I could awaken the power in my arms.
E_H2_Main_4_8,I was afraid of my Demon blood... and I've worked hard to seal it...
E_H2_Main_4_9,"Every time I regain consciousness, blood is all over my hands..."
E_H2_Main_4_10,"Haha, don't you worry."
E_H2_Main_4_11,You might experience a pretty big difference when all of this is over.
E_H2_Main_4_12,"Now, we should send those evil spirits we've gathered to where they belong."
E_H2_Main_4_13,"Jane, you are the only one who can actually use your power."
E_H2_Main_4_14,I should ask you to deal with the evil spirits.
E_H2_Main_4_15,Krrrr.
E_H2_Main_4_16,"Try all you want, Demons!"
E_H2_Main_4_17,We won't be killed by you.
E_H2_Main_4_18,We can only be scattered.
E_H2_Main_4_19,There were times we thought we could possess human bodies and live among them.
E_H2_Main_4_20,It seems that was nothing but a dream.
E_H2_Main_4_21,"We do not care. We don't feel pain, dismay, frustration, or despair."
E_H2_Main_4_22,"We have given up everything, cursing the living."
E_H2_Main_4_23,Are all evil spirits like that?
E_H2_Main_4_24,Those were some of the most cheesy cliches I've heard in my life.
E_H2_Main_4_25,Hahahaha.
E_H2_Main_4_26,"It's embarrassing, but my demon self says stuff like that, too..."
E_H2_Main_4_27,.....
E_H2_Main_4_28,I don't curse...
E_H2_Main_4_29,Pain... dismay... sorrow... despair...
E_H2_Main_4_30,I don't know such things...
E_H2_Main_4_31,I just... want to know... who I am.
E_H2_Main_4_32,"Haha, it's meaningless to talk to evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_4_33,They are the residue of souls left rotting in the world.
E_H2_Main_4_34,"Finish them now, please. We should look for some other evil spirits and get rid of them, too."
E_H2_Main_4_35,...
E_H2_Main_4_36,....?
E_H2_Main_4_37,"Jane, Jane? Let's go if you're done!"
E_H2_Main_4_38,...Okay.
E_H2_Main_4_39,Zzz...Zzz...
E_H2_Main_4_40,"Nyx, you idiot. You better warp me right next time... *Snore*"
E_H2_Main_4_41,"...Hmm, you were possessed this year as well?"
E_H2_Main_4_42,"I've been helping Rephy every year since Oddy asked, but... Haha."
E_H2_Main_4_43,"Haha, those evil spirits really have a thing for you. Don't you think so, Nyx?"
E_H2_Main_4_44,"It was the spirits of vampires that died during the ruination of Galluah Plains 100 years ago, wasn't it?"
E_H2_Main_4_45,"Pfft, all thanks to you."
E_H2_Main_4_46,Your curse has made this place quite a gathering ground for the spirits.
E_H2_Main_4_47,"Hahaha, this is more like a prank than a curse."
E_H2_Main_4_48,"And you could have lifted the curse if you wanted to, couldn't you?"
E_H2_Main_4_49,Oh? Do you want me to cast something more powerful and make this more fun?
E_H2_Main_4_50,"Hahaha, I politely decline."
E_H2_Main_4_51,It's hardly a pleasant experience.
E_H2_Main_4_52,"Although I have to admit it was useful in getting rid of those evil spirits,"
E_H2_Main_4_53,there's too many of them after us.
E_H2_Main_4_54,"*Giggle* Well, I have to say I'm grateful to you, Sage of the Sword."
E_H2_Main_4_55,A massive number of evil spirits must have gathered here to possess someone with an unyielding soul like yourself.
E_H2_Main_4_56,And the refined dark energy gained from exorcising them...
E_H2_Main_4_57,That allowed things to come along more quickly than what I had planned.
E_H2_Main_4_58,"I'm glad it helped, but I'm already exhausted."
E_H2_Main_4_59,I guess I'll have to call it a day.
E_H2_Main_4_60,"Heh heh, I've seen you work. I can take over your role this year."
E_H2_Main_4_61,"The job is getting rid of all the evil spirits so that they won't do any harm to the living, right?"
E_H2_Main_4_62,"I'll handle this in my way and do as I please. After all, I need to find some benefit to doing all this."
E_H2_Main_4_63,"For what it's worth, you've been doing everything on your own way anyway."
E_H2_Main_4_64,"Hahaha. Well, as long as your way doesn't interfere with mine."
E_H2_Main_4_65,I'll leave this year's Halloween to you.
E_H2_Main_4_66,It'd be better that you take care of it rather than an outsider like myself.
E_H2_Main_4_67,Leave it to me. *Giggle*
E_H2_Main_4_68,"Phew, she's a real handful."
E_H2_Main_4_69,"Hey, friend. Don't you think you should wake up now?"
E_H2_Main_4_70,"Zzz... Rephy, you! Listen to me... You do nothing but sleep."
E_H2_Main_4_71,"Haiz... Zzz, Zzz..."
E_H2_Main_4_72,"Hahaha, I wish I could be so laid-back."
E_H2_Main_4_73,I doubt he'll remember being possessed at all.
E_H2_Main_5_1,"Oh, I was wondering why all we've seen are animals."
E_H2_Main_5_2,"It seems that the evil spirits of animals are attracted to their own kind, just like how darkness diseases work."
E_H2_Main_5_3,"Well, I never knew animals could become evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_5_4,"Well, the Dark Legion killed off all the living creatures they saw during the Demon War, so..."
E_H2_Main_5_5,There's no doubt those animals bear a grudge.
E_H2_Main_5_6,But don't they look strange?
E_H2_Main_5_7,They seem to be fighting among each other.
E_H2_Main_5_8,"Yes, so it seems. What's happening?"
E_H2_Main_5_9,"Come on, talk to me!"
E_H2_Main_5_10,How long are you going to act sullen like that?
E_H2_Main_5_11,Huh!? I'm fine!
E_H2_Main_5_12,That's not the tone of someone who's fine.
E_H2_Main_5_13,"I told you, I'm fine!"
E_H2_Main_5_14,"It's just... we just wanted to possess something bigger, stronger, and scarier!"
E_H2_Main_5_15,Look at us! We're a joke!
E_H2_Main_5_16,The other evil spirits will make fun of us!
E_H2_Main_5_17,Are we not cute?
E_H2_Main_5_18,There's nothing wrong with that!
E_H2_Main_5_19,Being cute is absolutely not the point!
E_H2_Main_5_20,"Some of them were vampires,"
E_H2_Main_5_21,and others were like cool dark knights!
E_H2_Main_5_22,And we're cats! Cats!
E_H2_Main_5_23,"Cats are adorable,"
E_H2_Main_5_24,but no one gets intimidated by a bunch of cats!
E_H2_Main_5_25,"Hey, I know you like it."
E_H2_Main_5_26,Cats are ferocious! Someone will find us threatening!
E_H2_Main_5_27,Urgh!!!!
E_H2_Main_5_28,Hmmm?
E_H2_Main_5_29,Are they really evil spirits?
E_H2_Main_5_30,I thought they were masses of corrupted energy.
E_H2_Main_5_31,They're so cute!
E_H2_Main_5_32,"Hahaha, like I said, they can be unpredictable."
E_H2_Main_5_33,"Animal souls are purer than human ones, even after they've become evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_5_34,"They didn't lose their minds to darkness, so they've retained their pure aspects."
E_H2_Main_5_35,Adorable...
E_H2_Main_5_36,Should we get them and make them our pets?
E_H2_Main_5_37,"Hahaha, that's very unlikely."
E_H2_Main_5_38,What are we going to say to the ones that got possessed?
E_H2_Main_5_39,Cute...
E_H2_Main_5_40,...?
E_H2_Main_5_41,Jane? She's not used to showing her emotions...
E_H2_Main_5_42,"Haha, it's a good sign."
E_H2_Main_5_43,Just watch for now.
E_H2_Main_6_1,"Urgh, Darn it!"
E_H2_Main_6_2,Uuurgh...
E_H2_Main_6_3,"It's because of you! We should have taken stronger bodies, not cute ones!"
E_H2_Main_6_4,"Hey, easy."
E_H2_Main_6_5,We're just a bunch of wandering souls.
E_H2_Main_6_6,Maybe it's time for us to leave for where we should go.
E_H2_Main_6_7,We look adorable and we're having fun! Isn't that all that matters?
E_H2_Main_6_8,I have to say you are the least evil spirits I've ever seen.
E_H2_Main_6_9,"Well, looking cute isn't that bad, actually..."
E_H2_Main_6_10,"No, wait. You're putting the wrong ideas in my head!"
E_H2_Main_6_11,"Uh oh, you got me."
E_H2_Main_6_12,I think we keep bumping into some really weird evil spirits today.
E_H2_Main_6_13,"There were cheesy ones before, and"
E_H2_Main_6_14,now these cuties...
E_H2_Main_6_15,"Hahaha, I've never seen ones like them, either. It's pretty interesting."
E_H2_Main_6_16,But work is work.
E_H2_Main_6_17,They shouldn't have too much strength left in them. Let's finish up here.
E_H2_Main_6_18,"Ezekiel, please start."
E_H2_Main_6_19,Eh? me?
E_H2_Main_6_20,"You haven't been fighting as well as you could, right?"
E_H2_Main_6_21,Shouldn't you be getting used to your powers so that you can resist your demon self?
E_H2_Main_6_22,...
E_H2_Main_6_23,"Okay, I'll try."
E_H2_Main_6_24,...Kuh!
E_H2_Main_6_25,"Kugh, kugh. I, I did it!"
E_H2_Main_6_26,Urgh!?
E_H2_Main_6_27,Kwaaaaaaah!!!
E_H2_Main_6_28,I won't let a single body part fall to these filthy evil spirits!
E_H2_Main_6_29,"This is, this is my body! Mine!"
E_H2_Main_6_30,I won't let anyone take it from me!
E_H2_Main_6_31,Kuh!
E_H2_Main_6_32,Are you okay!?
E_H2_Main_6_33,You look pale...
E_H2_Main_6_34,It's nothing. Hahaha....
E_H2_Main_6_35,I'm just tired from doing something new...
E_H2_Main_6_36,Yeah? As long as it's nothing serious...
E_H2_Main_6_37,*Sigh*
E_H2_Main_6_38,That was a strong reaction... What should I do later?
E_H2_Main_6_39,Urgh... My head hurts...
E_H2_Main_6_40,I was looking for a box of Halloween candy for my sister...
E_H2_Main_6_41,The demons came out of nowhere...
E_H2_Main_6_42,Urgh.. Where am I?
E_H2_Main_6_43,I was working on the Technomagical pumpkin decoration in the Royal Lab...
E_H2_Main_6_44,*Giggle* My apologies to both of you.
E_H2_Main_6_45,I'm sorry to bother you.
E_H2_Main_6_46,A Demon! You...!
E_H2_Main_6_47,"Haha, no need for hostility. I won't harm you."
E_H2_Main_6_48,"Well, it's true when people say dragons are powerful beings."
E_H2_Main_6_49,You can still remember things after you get possessed by evil spirits.
E_H2_Main_6_50,"Psh, we're powerful!"
E_H2_Main_6_51,You'll pay dearly if you look down on me because I'm still young!
E_H2_Main_6_52,Huh? What happened?
E_H2_Main_6_53,I can't barely remember anything. Why am I wearing these clothes?
E_H2_Main_6_54,"Oh, they're actually very cute! I should tell Kara to wear them later."
E_H2_Main_6_55,"Haha, it's nothing. I just let some wandering souls possess your bodies."
E_H2_Main_6_56,You won't suffer any serious side effects.
E_H2_Main_6_57,You mean... g-ghosts!?
E_H2_Main_6_58,I'm just getting help from those who have strong souls like the two of you.
E_H2_Main_6_59,I've gathered enough refined dark energy. My business here is over.
E_H2_Main_6_60,"Thank you for your cooperation. Then, happy Halloween! *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_6_61,...Grrr...
E_H2_Main_6_62,Hey! W-wake up!
E_H2_Main_6_63,"Oh, no... I still need to find a present for my sister..."
E_H2_Main_6_64,"But then, I can't leave her here unconscious...!"
E_H2_Main_6_65,I'll take you to the nearest inn!
E_H2_Main_7_1,"Eww, they're so gross."
E_H2_Main_7_2,"I'm okay with spiders, but"
E_H2_Main_7_3,those slimy things... Yuk!
E_H2_Main_7_4,Huh? Pudding? *Drool*
E_H2_Main_7_5,"Uh? What is it, Ezekiel?"
E_H2_Main_7_6,N-nothing!
E_H2_Main_7_7,They remind me of something...
E_H2_Main_7_8,...?
E_H2_Main_7_9,I was curious what kind of evil spirits would appear this time.
E_H2_Main_7_10,Are they it? Kids' souls in monsters?
E_H2_Main_7_11,"Hmm, not exactly."
E_H2_Main_7_12,These monsters have nothing to do with evil spirits. Rather... They look like they're captivated.
E_H2_Main_7_13,Captivated? By what?
E_H2_Main_7_14,"Hmmm, well. Could it be your charm, Epis?"
E_H2_Main_7_15,Kyaa! You're creeping me out!
E_H2_Main_7_16,Just kidding. Hahaha.
E_H2_Main_7_17,Huh? Am I hearing things? Is that music?
E_H2_Main_7_18,...?
E_H2_Main_7_19,"Have you heard it before, Jane?"
E_H2_Main_7_20,...No.
E_H2_Main_7_21,"But, it's... beautiful."
E_H2_Main_7_22,...Beautiful...?
E_H2_Main_7_23,Hmm...
E_H2_Main_7_24,It actually sounds pretty great!
E_H2_Main_7_25,Let's go take a look!
E_H2_Main_7_26,"Heh heh heh. In our past lives, we were eaten by slimes, the minions of Demons,"
E_H2_Main_7_27,"but now that we've grown stronger, we'll capture them and make them our slaves!"
E_H2_Main_7_28,"This Halloween, we'll be slime masters!"
E_H2_Main_7_29,"Here, I've brought a lot of them again, so hurry and sing it!"
E_H2_Main_7_30,"A Blue Slime, Red Slime, Green Slime, I've got them all!"
E_H2_Main_7_31,"Oh and, I've burnt one of them while trying to catch them. You might want to heal it."
E_H2_Main_7_32,"Lala, La, La, Lalalalaa!"
E_H2_Main_7_33,"Hey, you're burning it even worse!"
E_H2_Main_7_34,"Not that song, the other one!"
E_H2_Main_7_35,"La, lalala!"
E_H2_Main_7_36,Hey! You're not listening!
E_H2_Main_7_37,What in the world is this?...
E_H2_Main_7_38,Puddings.. in different colors!
E_H2_Main_7_39,You just love pudding when you're a human or a demon.
E_H2_Main_7_40,It's surprising that you see them as pudding in the first place...
E_H2_Main_7_41,Ehhh? What?
E_H2_Main_7_42,I think they look just like pudding...
E_H2_Main_7_43,...Beautiful melody...
E_H2_Main_7_44,I can recall... The waltz I used to listen to...
E_H2_Main_7_45,I used to dance to it... Those memories...
E_H2_Main_7_46,...
E_H2_Main_8_1,"Eww, gooey and sticky... Yuck!"
E_H2_Main_8_2,...
E_H2_Main_8_3,...What are you doing?
E_H2_Main_8_4,"Oh, oops! in spite of myself..."
E_H2_Main_8_5,Boohoo! Our slime minions!
E_H2_Main_8_6,"Heal, quickly!"
E_H2_Main_8_7,"Lulu, lulu!"
E_H2_Main_8_8,...
E_H2_Main_8_9,Darn it! I should burn you all first!!
E_H2_Main_8_10,"Well, maybe it's just me, but..."
E_H2_Main_8_11,"Except for the vampire evil spirits we first met, none of the other evil spirits made much sense."
E_H2_Main_8_12,The cats and the witches...
E_H2_Main_8_13,They were like... They felt nothing like evil spirits.
E_H2_Main_8_14,"Haha, all evil spirits are different."
E_H2_Main_8_15,"Regardless of race, humans, Demons, or Angels, some of them get along and others simply don't."
E_H2_Main_8_16,"Like you and me, right?"
E_H2_Main_8_17,"Thank you, I understand it now very clearly."
E_H2_Main_8_18,"Why, it's great to hear that you think we get along."
E_H2_Main_8_19,"I have to say I'm quite happy and shy at the same time, Epis."
E_H2_Main_8_20,Oh my...
E_H2_Main_8_21,Forget it. Let's just stop talking.
E_H2_Main_8_22,"Well, enough joking around. This time..."
E_H2_Main_8_23,"Viska, no, I should call you Vi."
E_H2_Main_8_24,"Please, it's your turn."
E_H2_Main_8_25,Umm... Then I'll need to control my powers so I don't hurt the hosts...
E_H2_Main_8_26,...Hyaa!
E_H2_Main_8_27,Kyaaa! What the!?
E_H2_Main_8_28,I was chasing after a bunch of slimes... Huh?
E_H2_Main_8_29,Is this a dream? That's a lot of slimes...
E_H2_Main_8_30,Wait! They're all dead!
E_H2_Main_8_31,Nooooooo!
E_H2_Main_8_32,You brought them all. Clean them up yourself.
E_H2_Main_8_33,It's a complete mess. All these slime bodies.
E_H2_Main_8_34,Perhaps I could catch a slime and keep it as a pet...?
E_H2_Main_8_35,...!!
E_H2_Main_8_36,Oh! You know slimes are great!
E_H2_Main_8_37,"I've explained it over and over again, but Roi just doesn't get it!"
E_H2_Main_8_38,...Um? I'm just...
E_H2_Main_8_39,"Hey, have a seat there."
E_H2_Main_8_40,Let's talk about why slimes are so interesting!
E_H2_Main_8_41,...?????
E_H2_Main_8_42,"Umm, he's in for it now..."
E_H2_Main_8_43,I was singing some kind of unfinished song while I was sleeping?
E_H2_Main_8_44,I don't remember at all....
E_H2_Main_8_45,Hmm...
E_H2_Main_8_46,A very... beautiful melody....
E_H2_Main_8_47,I want... to hear it again...
E_H2_Main_8_48,...!
E_H2_Main_8_49,"Heh heh, thank you!"
E_H2_Main_8_50,I'll sing it to your when I finish making the song.
E_H2_Main_8_51,Let's get moving if everything is done!
E_H2_Main_8_52,Hurry! I'm sick and tired of looking like an Angel.
E_H2_Main_8_53,"Oh, I'm hurt by what you said. Don't you like what I prepared for you?"
E_H2_Main_8_54,You brought Angel clothes for a Demon!
E_H2_Main_8_55,...
E_H2_Main_8_56,But that child named Cleo...
E_H2_Main_8_57,Considering the characteristics of her mana and the fact that she remembers things...
E_H2_Main_8_58,"Like they say, like mother, like daughter."
E_H2_Main_8_59,We should keep an eye on her.
E_H2_Main_8_60,To prevent any future incidents... *Giggle*
E_H2_Main_9_1,So the Fallen Angels turned their backs on the Angels and came to earth.
E_H2_Main_9_2,"Along with Dark Lord Angmund, they..."
E_H2_Main_9_3,"Umm, this part will be on the exam, so study it, rookies."
E_H2_Main_9_4,Those who fail to provide the correct answer will suffer heavenly wrath.
E_H2_Main_9_5,Gerrrrrr...\n(How are we supposed to memorize all that...?)
E_H2_Main_9_6,Gaaaarrrr... (We don't have brains...)
E_H2_Main_9_7,"Oh, is that so?"
E_H2_Main_9_8,"Then, shove off!"
E_H2_Main_9_9,"If you feel you can't do something, find a way to make it possible."
E_H2_Main_9_10,I don't need any soldiers who can't think on their own.
E_H2_Main_9_11,Guiiiiiii... (Kugh!!)
E_H2_Main_9_12,What in the world.. are they doing?
E_H2_Main_9_13,...I'm not sure...
E_H2_Main_9_14,This doesn't feel right...
E_H2_Main_9_15,Is my brain okay...?
E_H2_Main_9_16,"Hahaha, don't worry, Jane."
E_H2_Main_9_17,"The undead don't rely on organs to function,"
E_H2_Main_9_18,but on mana and the power of desire.
E_H2_Main_9_19,The reason why you became what you are is that you had such a strong will. It's because of the desire left in you.
E_H2_Main_9_20,"And I saw it all, and that's how I became interested in you."
E_H2_Main_9_21,"*Giggle* For me, it's easy with my curse to twist Malduk's spells."
E_H2_Main_9_22,...
E_H2_Main_9_23,"Tell me honestly, Shamilla."
E_H2_Main_9_24,Yes?
E_H2_Main_9_25,"Those evil spirits, you're the one that made them all, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_9_26,"The bodies of hosts might affect them to some extent, but they're too weird to be ordinary evil spirits!"
E_H2_Main_9_27,"It's your hobby, right? To twist the laws of nature, cause chaos, and watch it."
E_H2_Main_9_28,I'm pretty sure these evil spirits are twisted and artificial.
E_H2_Main_9_29,"Hahaha, I won't deny it."
E_H2_Main_9_30,"I carefully selected the ones that have extraordinarily strong and pure souls,"
E_H2_Main_9_31,and made them vulnerable to possession.
E_H2_Main_9_32,Evil spirits that cling to such souls have their malice significantly weakened.
E_H2_Main_9_33,"However, like always, there's a reason why I did what I did."
E_H2_Main_9_34,I saw that you were gathering refined dark energy!
E_H2_Main_9_35,"The other three might be clueless, but I'm different."
E_H2_Main_9_36,You couldn't have done all this just to pick on me.
E_H2_Main_9_37,...Is it for 'him?'
E_H2_Main_9_38,Or is it for Maria?
E_H2_Main_9_39,Hahahaha... Well?
E_H2_Main_9_40,I'm afraid I can't tell you right now.
E_H2_Main_9_41,"What I can tell you is that I will need the power that Morrah was gathering, too."
E_H2_Main_9_42,Hmm...
E_H2_Main_9_43,"Well, I don't know much about your plan, so I can't say much more."
E_H2_Main_9_44,Just don't do anything that would make Maria frown.
E_H2_Main_9_45,She's just... a poor kid.
E_H2_Main_9_46,"Haha, well. I'll take that into consideration."
E_H2_Main_10_1,Kyaah!
E_H2_Main_10_2,I'm sorry... Fallen angel.
E_H2_Main_10_3,"Kugh, You!"
E_H2_Main_10_4,Dark Lord will not let you...!
E_H2_Main_10_5,I don't... need...
E_H2_Main_10_6,Bad spirit... bullying the undead...
E_H2_Main_10_7,Get off...
E_H2_Main_10_8,"Huh, Jane can be pretty scary."
E_H2_Main_10_9,She must have felt sorry for those undead creatures.
E_H2_Main_10_10,"By the way, that line they're saying about the Dark Lord coming for us..."
E_H2_Main_10_11,They've been saying that for the last 100 years.
E_H2_Main_10_12,"Hahaha, I've never heard that."
E_H2_Main_10_13,"Well, honestly, I haven't done anything that would make them want to say that to me."
E_H2_Main_10_14,They should be more afraid of you than the Dark Lord.
E_H2_Main_10_15,"The Dark Lord's purpose is plain and simple, but you..."
E_H2_Main_10_16,"Now, now. That's enough talking."
E_H2_Main_10_17,"Vi, Ezekiel. I guess you've gotten used to your powers, yes?"
E_H2_Main_10_18,Um... I think so.
E_H2_Main_10_19,My body doesn't feel as stiff as it used to.
E_H2_Main_10_20,Same here. I couldn't control the demon blood at all at first.
E_H2_Main_10_21,Is it because of your curse?
E_H2_Main_10_22,"*Giggle* Partly, yes."
E_H2_Main_10_23,The key here is getting accustomed to living with dark energy.
E_H2_Main_10_24,All you needed was a little bit of practice.
E_H2_Main_10_25,It's just...
E_H2_Main_10_26,Both of you were too suppressed by your demon selves.
E_H2_Main_10_27,So you didn't have enough time nor the opportunity to get used to your powers.
E_H2_Main_10_28,"Hahaha, so this was training?"
E_H2_Main_10_29,"Well, yes."
E_H2_Main_10_30,"...I'm still a bit unsure... but yes, I think so, too."
E_H2_Main_10_31,*Giggle* Glad to hear that.
E_H2_Main_10_32,"Now, we don't have a lot of evil spirits left around us."
E_H2_Main_10_33,Let's go take care of them.
E_H2_Main_10_34,I guess it's time.
E_H2_Main_10_35,"Jane is slowly recovering her emotions,"
E_H2_Main_10_36,and two half demons have started to tap more into their power.
E_H2_Main_10_37,The curses on them could be lifted fairly soon.
E_H2_Main_10_38,Only one last stage to go...
E_H2_Main_10_39,Everything is going as planned.
E_H2_Main_10_40,It would be awfully exciting at the end? Hahaha!
E_H2_Main_10_41,Arrgh.. My head...
E_H2_Main_10_42,I was around to meet High Priestess Iris... What happened to me?
E_H2_Main_10_43,Ouch... Are you okay?
E_H2_Main_10_44,"Kugh, I'm fine."
E_H2_Main_10_45,I'm not sure what just happened...
E_H2_Main_10_46,I remember that I needed to visit Orvel Castle to have a talk with Princess Scarlet.
E_H2_Main_10_47,But everything else is so fuzzy... Argh.
E_H2_Main_10_48,"Ugh, what's that unpleasant thing over there?"
E_H2_Main_10_49,It doesn't seem that I can do something about it now but...
E_H2_Main_10_50,I should definitely kill it later.
E_H2_Main_11_1,Huh... What's that?
E_H2_Main_11_2,Is that an evil spirit? It looks almost like the Dark Lord.
E_H2_Main_11_3,Hm hm. Those two are both pretty good-looking.
E_H2_Main_11_4,Maybe I could seduce them...
E_H2_Main_11_5,"Hmm, the Dark Lord..."
E_H2_Main_11_6,Why are they acting like that?
E_H2_Main_11_7,They're just staring at us without saying anything.
E_H2_Main_11_8,Well?
E_H2_Main_11_9,Can't they speak at all?
E_H2_Main_11_10,"We ran into some talkative ones, but that doesn't mean there can't be any quiet ones."
E_H2_Main_11_11,They look quiet and dangerous. Doesn't that make them more charming?
E_H2_Main_11_12,"Hahaha, yes, they look dangerous."
E_H2_Main_11_13,They're the scariest-looking evil spirits we've seen so far.
E_H2_Main_11_14,"And it seems there are a lot of evil spirits inside them, too."
E_H2_Main_11_15,Are we in danger?
E_H2_Main_11_16,"Haha, evil spirits are just evil spirits. It won't be any different from our previous battles."
E_H2_Main_11_17,"It might not be easy, but you can do it."
E_H2_Main_11_18,"Oh, I know I told you, Epis, but you can't fight with all your strength."
E_H2_Main_11_19,"It's okay. Jane will protect me. Right, Jane?"
E_H2_Main_11_20,...?
E_H2_Main_11_21,Jane!
E_H2_Main_11_22,Stop fooling around and stand in the front.
E_H2_Main_11_23,We can't attract evil spirits without you.
E_H2_Main_11_24,Let's move quickly and get this over with.
E_H2_Main_11_25,Vi...!
E_H2_Main_12_1,Kugh!
E_H2_Main_12_2,Argh..
E_H2_Main_12_3,Wow. They really didn't say anything until the fight was over.
E_H2_Main_12_4,They're men of few words! I like that!
E_H2_Main_12_5,I might just let these evil spirits go.
E_H2_Main_12_6,That's not for you to decide.
E_H2_Main_12_7,"Arrrgh, I know!"
E_H2_Main_12_8,....
E_H2_Main_12_9,....
E_H2_Main_12_10,?
E_H2_Main_12_11,What? Do you have anything to say to me?
E_H2_Main_12_12,Darn it! I can't do this anymore.
E_H2_Main_12_13,Hey! I can't fight if you're forcing me to look cool and silent!
E_H2_Main_12_14,"The whole idea that people would avoid picking fights with cool, quiet men is stupid."
E_H2_Main_12_15,Hahaha... Ahahaha... Maybe we were wrong.
E_H2_Main_12_16,"But tell me, we were cool, weren't we?"
E_H2_Main_12_17,"Quiet, yet full of dignity. We were like proud knights!"
E_H2_Main_12_18,"You can say whatever you want, but we lost. We're losers."
E_H2_Main_12_19,"Well, that's... well..."
E_H2_Main_12_20,&!*$&!*$&!*$&!*$
E_H2_Main_12_21,....
E_H2_Main_12_22,HEY.
E_H2_Main_12_23,?
E_H2_Main_12_24,You're breaking character!
E_H2_Main_12_25,Eek!!!
E_H2_Main_12_26,"Hmm, I've told you many times... You're not allowed to use your full power."
E_H2_Main_12_27,Eek.. Argh..
E_H2_Main_12_28,"Phew! This feels amazing! I've been feeling a lot of stress for 100 years,"
E_H2_Main_12_29,and now I feel like I blew off some steam.
E_H2_Main_12_30,"Did you say something about me, Epis?"
E_H2_Main_12_31,"Or, should I say, Epis the defiant, who just went on a rampage, ignoring what I told you?"
E_H2_Main_12_32,Eek! It's nothing!
E_H2_Main_12_33,I just made them unable to run away! I didn't finish them off completely!
E_H2_Main_12_34,Phew... All right. I'll let this go. Hahaha.
E_H2_Main_12_35,"Okay, let's wrap this up."
E_H2_Main_12_36,"Vi, Ezekiel. They're all yours."
E_H2_Main_12_37,"Aww.. *Cough, cough*"
E_H2_Main_12_38,Argh... My head... What just happened?
E_H2_Main_12_39,I can't remember a thing...
E_H2_Main_12_40,"Oh, right! I was about to give out candies to the kids in the orphanage."
E_H2_Main_12_41,Then suddenly some black smoke wrapped around me...
E_H2_Main_12_42,Kugh... my memory... It's all fuzzy again.
E_H2_Main_12_43,I had to come to the Princess to escort her.
E_H2_Main_12_44,But what's grandpa of Clause doing here?
E_H2_Main_12_45,Did I fall asleep while walking? And the grandpa looks like he's been possessed or something.
E_H2_Main_12_46,"Hmm, both of them look more handsome when they're not talking."
E_H2_Main_12_47,"Well, but I can't say they aren't cute as they are."
E_H2_Main_12_48,Stop talking nonsense and let's go.
E_H2_Main_12_49,You're wasting time!
E_H2_Main_12_50,Come on! A girl's got to have a moment to appreciate pretty things!
E_H2_Main_12_51,"Stop being so bossy, Vi!"
E_H2_Main_12_52,"The longer you goof off, the more Viska will want to kill you when she wakes up."
E_H2_Main_12_53,Is that how you want it to be?
E_H2_Main_12_54,"Eek, absolutely not."
E_H2_Main_13_1,"Well, our ghost-busting has come to an end."
E_H2_Main_13_2,I can't sense any evil spirits around here.
E_H2_Main_13_3,"Ewww, it's been too long."
E_H2_Main_13_4,Let us go!
E_H2_Main_13_5,I should lift the curse from the two of you as well.
E_H2_Main_13_6,Do you feel you have better control over your body?
E_H2_Main_13_7,"Umm, I'm not sure why, but it's getting easier to use this power."
E_H2_Main_13_8,Have I become used to controlling the demon blood without Viska's help?
E_H2_Main_13_9,It's because of the dark energy scattered around here.
E_H2_Main_13_10,The higher number of evil spirits means the energy of darkness around here is more condensed.
E_H2_Main_13_11,It can be a great source of energy for Demons.
E_H2_Main_13_12,It's like how clean air is vital to humans.
E_H2_Main_13_13,"Unlike Epis and me, the three of you haven't experienced Pandemonium in your bodies, so it must have helped you greatly."
E_H2_Main_13_14,"Of course,"
E_H2_Main_13_15,please don't think I did all this for free.
E_H2_Main_13_16,Argh... What have you...?
E_H2_Main_13_17,....!!!
E_H2_Main_13_18,Kuh... Shamilla!
E_H2_Main_13_19,"You mean, selfish witch!"
E_H2_Main_13_20,Kugh!?
E_H2_Main_13_21,...
E_H2_Main_13_22,Kuaaaaah!
E_H2_Main_13_23,Get lost! I won't be able to sleep tonight if I can't take a swing at that demon's face!
E_H2_Main_13_24,N-no! You should calm yourself!
E_H2_Main_13_25,"Shut up, you weakling!"
E_H2_Main_13_26,If you're not willing to let me take over...
E_H2_Main_13_27,I have no choice but to...
E_H2_Main_13_28,Kuahh!
E_H2_Main_13_29,...
E_H2_Main_13_30,....?
E_H2_Main_13_31,Zzzzzz...
E_H2_Main_13_32,Hey! ...Hey?
E_H2_Main_13_33,"Hahaha, thank you very much for helping me today, all of you."
E_H2_Main_13_34,"It was all worth the trouble, making you exorcise evil spirits on your own and letting you absorb the darkness at a close distance."
E_H2_Main_13_35,...?
E_H2_Main_13_36,"Hahaha, those are all parts of you."
E_H2_Main_13_37,"They are the darkness that sits inside you. Your weakness, vulnerability, or maybe a forgotten past memory."
E_H2_Main_13_38,"Evil spirits do not die. They become scattered temporarily, or they get sent to a different place through an exorcism, but they can't die."
E_H2_Main_13_39,"The bits of astral composites you exorcised, along with their lingering wills, have permeated your minds."
E_H2_Main_13_40,"If your demon selves were awake, you could have noticed it right away, but..."
E_H2_Main_13_41,"Kugh, you make me feel sick."
E_H2_Main_13_42,Do you know how unpleasant it is to share a body with such wimpy idiots?
E_H2_Main_13_43,"I couldn't agree more, Crab Legs!"
E_H2_Main_13_44,"It felt so freaking terrible to be surrounded by evil spirits, you Witch!"
E_H2_Main_13_45,I can't just let this be!
E_H2_Main_13_46,"Hey, take it easy."
E_H2_Main_13_47,I just wanted to give the three of you what you needed.
E_H2_Main_13_48,Hmph. Nonsense!
E_H2_Main_13_49,You just wanted to enjoy this situation!
E_H2_Main_13_50,My human self is too weak to use my powers!
E_H2_Main_13_51,He should have just sat in the corner and stayed quiet. He doesn't need to be trained for anything!
E_H2_Main_13_52,Sh-shut up!
E_H2_Main_13_53,Wh-what!?
E_H2_Main_13_54,"It's my body, too!"
E_H2_Main_13_55,She didn't hurt us at all! She gave me the chance to take control over my body and the demon blood!
E_H2_Main_13_56,You always did what you felt like doing till now.
E_H2_Main_13_57,It's my turn to be in control!
E_H2_Main_13_58,I'll be moving my own body today!
E_H2_Main_13_59,Wow!
E_H2_Main_13_60,He can be quite intimidating when things get heated up.
E_H2_Main_13_61,...
E_H2_Main_13_62,Huff... Argh....
E_H2_Main_13_63,....
E_H2_Main_13_64,You.. weakling!
E_H2_Main_13_65,"I don't think you have what it takes, but you definitely grew some balls."
E_H2_Main_13_66,"Psh, fine. Do whatever you'd like then."
E_H2_Main_13_67,....?
E_H2_Main_13_68,Why do you think I was born?
E_H2_Main_13_69,"Because you were too afraid of demon blood? Yes, partly."
E_H2_Main_13_70,But mostly I was born to protect your feeble self.
E_H2_Main_13_71,But... it seems I won't be able to coddle you for too long. Hahaha.
E_H2_Main_13_72,...
E_H2_Main_13_73,"Good luck, human."
E_H2_Main_13_74,I'll be watching you from here.
E_H2_Main_13_75,But don't forget.
E_H2_Main_13_76,"When you're in danger, I'm taking control over this body."
E_H2_Main_13_77,Huff... Argh.....
E_H2_Main_13_78,That was...
E_H2_Main_13_79,...Hmm. So that's how this goes.
E_H2_Main_13_80,"You, Half Breed. Hahaha. Well, struggling wimps are always fun to watch."
E_H2_Main_13_81,"If that's his decision, I should respect it."
E_H2_Main_13_82,...?!
E_H2_Main_13_83,Huh?
E_H2_Main_13_84,Viska...?
E_H2_Main_13_85,"Why, you don't like it? I'm giving you a chance to fight."
E_H2_Main_13_86,"They're not the Demons that you hate the most... but then, evil spirits are not completely different from Demons, either."
E_H2_Main_13_87,It doesn't look like it'd be tasty. Do whatever you want.
E_H2_Main_13_88,.....
E_H2_Main_13_89,Thank you.
E_H2_Main_13_90,"Hahaha, so all of you seem to be ready."
E_H2_Main_13_91,...Yes.
E_H2_Main_13_92,"Yes, we're ready to go at any time."
E_H2_Main_13_93,*Giggle* Then please exterminate the darkness in front of you.
E_H2_Main_13_94,I'll have something very helpful ready for you when you're done. *Giggle*
E_H2_Main_14_1,This energy... I feel refreshed... I can clearly feel the demon power in my body.
E_H2_Main_14_2,And all these memories...
E_H2_Main_14_3,Are these Viska's memories from when she was in Pandemonium?
E_H2_Main_14_4,The things my demon self was doing... The people she met... The things she felt...
E_H2_Main_14_5,Jane...Jane... Ah! I know! She's the princess that Theo was looking for.
E_H2_Main_14_6,Then she is...
E_H2_Main_14_7,"Hahaha, as I told you, that is the darkness mixed in with your will."
E_H2_Main_14_8,"If you choose to strip off the darkness and absorb it, you'll be able to recover your lost memories and the scattered bits of your potential."
E_H2_Main_14_9,"And of course, I told you I'll get something in return."
E_H2_Main_14_10,I'll collect the vast amount of darkness that remains.
E_H2_Main_14_11,"My head hurts... My heart, too..."
E_H2_Main_14_12,Is this... pain?
E_H2_Main_14_13,No... it's different.
E_H2_Main_14_14,"Something stirring in me... happy, yet sad..."
E_H2_Main_14_15,"Haha, I guess you've remembered something."
E_H2_Main_14_16,...Yeah.
E_H2_Main_14_17,I have...
E_H2_Main_14_18,It's my memory...
E_H2_Main_14_19,But it's not the memory of the present me.
E_H2_Main_14_20,Huh? What do you mean?
E_H2_Main_14_21,"This is... the memory of Jane Grey, the princess of Republic of Gray..."
E_H2_Main_14_22,I'm an undead... made with Jane's corpse...
E_H2_Main_14_23,"I'm Jane, but..."
E_H2_Main_14_24,I'm not the same Jane I used to be...
E_H2_Main_14_25,I can't say that this is my own memory...
E_H2_Main_14_26,"Umm, Mr. Handsome might find it very frustrating when he hears this."
E_H2_Main_14_27,But... I want to know.
E_H2_Main_14_28,The old me... The real Jane...
E_H2_Main_14_29,"I can't go back, and I could never become who I used to be before I died..."
E_H2_Main_14_30,If... if only I could start all over again...
E_H2_Main_14_31,...
E_H2_Main_14_32,"Phew, Jane, you cutie!"
E_H2_Main_14_33,How adorable!
E_H2_Main_14_34,"*Giggle* So, that's your answer."
E_H2_Main_14_35,"Just as I expected, you're as interesting as your knight."
E_H2_Main_14_36,"Now, it's all over, right?"
E_H2_Main_14_37,Right?
E_H2_Main_14_38,"I can take these clothes off yet, right?"
E_H2_Main_14_39,...
E_H2_Main_14_40,"Oh, not quite."
E_H2_Main_14_41,Huuuh?
E_H2_Main_14_42,Oops.
E_H2_Main_14_43,"Angels are angels. I've cast a curse to make you absorb evil spirits, but to no avail."
E_H2_Main_14_44,You've purified everything in less than a day.
E_H2_Main_14_45,I even dressed you as fallen angels. What a disappointment.
E_H2_Main_14_46,"*Huff, huff* Shut up, Demon!"
E_H2_Main_14_47,Do you think you can just get away after what you've done to us?
E_H2_Main_14_48,"Hahaha, why, of course I do."
E_H2_Main_14_49,I can see that my curse is still affecting you. Don't push yourself.
E_H2_Main_14_50,"Farewell, then."
E_H2_Main_14_51,...?!
E_H2_Main_14_52,...
E_H2_Main_14_53,...
E_H2_Main_14_54,"Argh... we lost her, but..."
E_H2_Main_14_55,I won't let you go!
E_H2_Main_14_56,"Face the judgment of light, Demon!"
E_H2_Main_14_57,"Aww, darn!"
E_H2_Main_14_58,"Shamilla, you dirty witch!"
E_H2_Main_14_59,You'll pay for this!
E_H2_Main_14_60,...What should we do..?
E_H2_Main_14_61,Fighting the Angels?
E_H2_Main_14_62,"Well, we don't have much choice."
E_H2_Main_14_63,They won't just let us run.
E_H2_Main_14_64,"We should knock them down or stun them quickly, and then get going."
E_H2_Main_14_65,"They don't look so well, either. Maybe it won't be too hard."
E_H2_Main_14_66,"But Vi, you don't seem to be well enough to fight. Let me be in charge."
E_H2_Main_14_67,"Alright. Thank you, Viska."
E_H2_Main_14_68,Fighting angels...? This is a little...
E_H2_Main_14_69,"Don't chicken out now, you wimp!"
E_H2_Main_14_70,But this can get really dangerous. Move away and take some rest.
E_H2_Main_14_71,"Hey, Crab Legs! We can do this, can't we?"
E_H2_Main_14_72,"Well, nothing's impossible."
E_H2_Main_14_73,"It's frustrating to admit that Shamilla actually did something for us,"
E_H2_Main_14_74,"but the stronger our human sides grow, the more powerful we become."
E_H2_Main_14_75,I feel sleepy. We should end this quickly...
E_H2_Main_14_76,"Stop talking, you three! Come and help!"
E_C2_Main_0_1,It's Christmas again.
E_C2_Main_0_2,"It's your first time here in Orvel since summer, isn't it?"
E_C2_Main_0_3,"Yeah, I think so."
E_C2_Main_0_4,"Heh heh, after all this time, I finally get to see my grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_0_5,I sure hope Grandpa Ricardo is doing alright...
E_C2_Main_0_6,I'm sure he's well.
E_C2_Main_0_7,"Even at his age, he's still strong and resilient."
E_C2_Main_0_8,"I bet he's in his Santa costume, giving out presents to the kids in the orphanage right now."
E_C2_Main_0_9,Or maybe he's busy running around the entire city doing that.
E_C2_Main_0_10,"Heh heh, I like it when Grandpa dresses up as Santa,"
E_C2_Main_0_11,"but I like these cute Christmas costumes, too!"
E_C2_Main_0_12,May's handmade costumes are so beautiful.
E_C2_Main_0_13,"Haha, yes, totally."
E_C2_Main_0_14,May has some amazing skills.
E_C2_Main_0_15,"But Sonia, why did we come here to Orvel all of a sudden?"
E_C2_Main_0_16,Did you get a request from the Tower of Sage?
E_C2_Main_0_17,You know I don't run errands for the Tower of Sage.
E_C2_Main_0_18,I really hate that they gave me this weird title. I'm not even part of their group...
E_C2_Main_0_19,I've said it before. I don't want to get involved with any wizards and alchemists.
E_C2_Main_0_20,"Heh heh, I remember."
E_C2_Main_0_21,"Well, technically, it's a request from the guild."
E_C2_Main_0_22,"You've heard about the legend of Santa, haven't you?"
E_C2_Main_0_23,One of the greatest saints who coerced one of the ancient monsters called Beast Rudolph into submission and used him as his servant
E_C2_Main_0_24,in slaying countless demons.
E_C2_Main_0_25,"Yeah, I know that story."
E_C2_Main_0_26,Grandpa Ricardo used to read it to me.
E_C2_Main_0_27,It's been said that the beast's blood was shed from that battle and seeped into the ground near Orvel.
E_C2_Main_0_28,The pine trees in the land grew on this blood and became powerful vessels of Mana.
E_C2_Main_0_29,"Apparently, the trees awaken once every 20 years on Christmas Eve."
E_C2_Main_0_30,And tonight is supposed to be the night.
E_C2_Main_0_31,Oh... I see!
E_C2_Main_0_32,"So, are we going to find those trees?"
E_C2_Main_0_33,"Well, at the very least, I need to look into it."
E_C2_Main_0_34,The enormous amount of Mana in them is said to attract monsters and even demons.
E_C2_Main_0_35,I cannot let that just happen.
E_C2_Main_0_36,And if the trees really hold such great Mana...
E_C2_Main_0_37,They could be the catalyst I need for this magic I want to use.
E_C2_Main_0_38,"Um? Sonia, what did you say?"
E_C2_Main_0_39,"Oh, uh, n-nothing."
E_C2_Main_0_40,"Okay, let's hurry!"
E_C2_Main_1_1,Umm... but I remember reading that the beast was huge.
E_C2_Main_1_2,"How big was it, really?"
E_C2_Main_1_3,Was it as big as a castle? A mountain? Maybe a dragon?
E_C2_Main_1_4,No way.
E_C2_Main_1_5,I'm sure the stories were exaggerating. It can't possibly be as big as a dragon...
E_C2_Main_1_6,"Yeesh, it's freaking cold!"
E_C2_Main_1_7,"This is all your fault, Lilia!"
E_C2_Main_1_8,"Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous!"
E_C2_Main_1_9,This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been so desperate for my sister's attention!
E_C2_Main_1_10,What'd you say? You brat!
E_C2_Main_1_11,"That's right, you knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_1_12,"Hahaha, stop fighting."
E_C2_Main_1_13,Did you forget why Laias sent two of you to me?
E_C2_Main_1_14,She wanted me to help you guys stop arguing.
E_C2_Main_1_15,"Shut up, Human!"
E_C2_Main_1_16,How dare you speak to a great Black Dragon in such a manner?
E_C2_Main_1_17,Ha!
E_C2_Main_1_18,Arghhh!
E_C2_Main_1_19,"Haha, that's what you get."
E_C2_Main_1_20,What? You bra-
E_C2_Main_1_21,Hyah!
E_C2_Main_1_22,Guh!
E_C2_Main_1_23,"Urgh, if only you weren't a friend of Laias!"
E_C2_Main_1_24,"Now, now. Settle down."
E_C2_Main_1_25,"I'm sure you're here to get Laias a great Christmas tree, right?"
E_C2_Main_1_26,Wasn't it you that wanted to make a Christmas tree out of a legendary pine tree?
E_C2_Main_1_27,"Psh.. Okay, okay. I get it!"
E_C2_Main_1_28,Whatever! Hmph.
E_C2_Main_1_29,....
E_C2_Main_1_30,Did he say he was a dragon?
E_C2_Main_1_31,A dragon...
E_C2_Main_1_32,"Umm, I don't think the dragons in the books looked that adorable..."
E_C2_Main_1_33,They said something about a legendary pine tree too.
E_C2_Main_1_34,"Let's follow them, Mirianne!"
E_C2_Main_2_1,"According to the legend, the forest is located north of Orvel..."
E_C2_Main_2_2,"Every year, only a handful of trees in the forest awaken."
E_C2_Main_2_3,One or two of them is what we might expect.
E_C2_Main_2_4,"Haha, if Esker were around, things would have been much easier for us."
E_C2_Main_2_5,We definitely could use some of his luck.
E_C2_Main_2_6,"...Hello? Are you listening, you two?"
E_C2_Main_2_7,"Huh, I could do this on my own."
E_C2_Main_2_8,And why in the world do I have to wear these clothes?
E_C2_Main_2_9,"Traditionally, priests of the Church of Lua walk around nearby towns every Christmas,"
E_C2_Main_2_10,"singing praises, praying for people, and blessing them."
E_C2_Main_2_11,And this is what they would wear when they're at it.
E_C2_Main_2_12,"But since you two have nothing to wear for the winter,"
E_C2_Main_2_13,"I told May your age and height, and the clothes came out to fit you just right."
E_C2_Main_2_14,"Oh, and since she wouldn't know much about your age as a dragon, I sort of guessed your human age from your looks and told her that."
E_C2_Main_2_15,That's not what I wanted to know!
E_C2_Main_2_16,"This is uncomfortable beyond imagination, I'm just going to tear..."
E_C2_Main_2_17,"Oh, and Laias paid for those clothes."
E_C2_Main_2_18,"So, in a way, you can consider them a present from Laias, I guess. Hahaha..."
E_C2_Main_2_19,...!
E_C2_Main_2_20,"*Clears throat* Well, I guess I'll have to wear them, then."
E_C2_Main_2_21,It won't kill to wear these for a day or two.
E_C2_Main_2_22,Tsk tsk...
E_C2_Main_2_23,What! Do you have a problem?
E_C2_Main_2_24,Anyway...
E_C2_Main_2_25,"Hey, why don't you show yourselves?"
E_C2_Main_2_26,Stop hiding like rats!
E_C2_Main_2_27,...!
E_C2_Main_2_28,"Hmm, I must say, I'm very surprised to see you."
E_C2_Main_2_29,"Archmage of Blue, the one who casts chantless lightning spells with no effort at all."
E_C2_Main_2_30,"...Hmm, you... You're not a human, are you?"
E_C2_Main_2_31,You're a Homunculus. An imitation of life made by humans...
E_C2_Main_2_32,And the other one is... a Half Elf.
E_C2_Main_2_33,"Hmph, I guess like attracts like, after all."
E_C2_Main_2_34,...
E_C2_Main_2_35,"*Sigh* Neraxis, you don't say such things to people you've never met before..."
E_C2_Main_2_36,"Words can hurt, knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_2_37,"Anyway, why were you following us?"
E_C2_Main_2_38,"Oh, umm... Actually..."
E_C2_Main_2_39,Ms. Dragon...?
E_C2_Main_2_40,"Oh, I did not introduce myself to you."
E_C2_Main_2_41,"I am Lilia, younger sister of Laias the Water Dragon, and one of the dragons guarding Aegina Desert."
E_C2_Main_2_42,And this knucklehead here is Neraxis.
E_C2_Main_2_43,He's a headache my sister picked up from somewhere.
E_C2_Main_2_44,Hey!
E_C2_Main_2_45,"I am Lucias, the priest from the Church of Lua."
E_C2_Main_2_46,I had a chance to acquaint myself with Laias.
E_C2_Main_2_47,"And so, I am on a journey with these two dragons."
E_C2_Main_2_48,I... I am...
E_C2_Main_2_49,"Relax. I know we're dragons, but you don't have to be so nervous."
E_C2_Main_2_50,Huh! Whatever.
E_C2_Main_2_51,"Umm... Then, we'll try."
E_C2_Main_2_52,The title... Archmage of whatever... It makes me feel weird.
E_C2_Main_2_53,Please just call me Sonia.
E_C2_Main_2_54,The Tower of Sage just started to call me that without my consent...
E_C2_Main_2_55,I see...
E_C2_Main_2_56,"My apologies, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_2_57,But I'm afraid our talk will have to wait.
E_C2_Main_2_58,...What?
E_C2_Main_2_59,Monsters... So many of them!
E_C2_Main_2_60,"Huh, they're just monsters!"
E_C2_Main_2_61,"Die, you trash!"
E_C2_Main_3_1,I expected more from them since they were drawn here by the legendary forest...
E_C2_Main_3_2,"Hmph, I'm not even warmed up yet!"
E_C2_Main_3_3,"Now, let's get back to what we were talking about."
E_C2_Main_3_4,Is there anything that we can do for you two?
E_C2_Main_3_5,"Oh, we happened to overhear you talking about the legendary tree..."
E_C2_Main_3_6,We're also looking for that.
E_C2_Main_3_7,Huh? No way! That tree is ours to take.
E_C2_Main_3_8,I promised Laias that I would show her the best Christmas tree ever.
E_C2_Main_3_9,"Hahaha, let's find the tree first and then we'll see."
E_C2_Main_3_10,Umm?
E_C2_Main_3_11,What's wrong?
E_C2_Main_3_12,Why did you stop all of a sudden?
E_C2_Main_3_13,"Ahahaha, it's just that"
E_C2_Main_3_14,we found the tree way a lot sooner than we thought.
E_C2_Main_3_15,Wow... Is this the legendary tree? But it's...
E_C2_Main_3_16,It doesn't look so special at all!
E_C2_Main_3_17,It's just a bit big and it seems to contain quite a lot of Mana..
E_C2_Main_3_18,"It's a tree, knucklehead. That's about as different as it gets."
E_C2_Main_3_19,"Hmph, only knuckleheads would call someone else a knucklehead, knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_3_20,!@#$%@#$%!!!
E_C2_Main_3_21,"Haiz, I'm not able to stop the two of you..."
E_C2_Main_3_22,...
E_C2_Main_3_23,"...Hmm, you are the 7th group to arrive."
E_C2_Main_3_24,"A human, dragons, and two children of a chaotic nature..."
E_C2_Main_3_25,?!
E_C2_Main_3_26,The tree talks!?
E_C2_Main_3_27,"I was born from the blood of Rudolph, the ancient monster."
E_C2_Main_3_28,"I am reborn, every once in 20 years,"
E_C2_Main_3_29,to grant wishes for people with the power in me.
E_C2_Main_3_30,"Now, tell me your wish."
E_C2_Main_3_31,A wish...
E_C2_Main_3_32,"Hm hm, I'll pass."
E_C2_Main_3_33,I'm not so desperate for something that I have to get it from a tree.
E_C2_Main_3_34,What about you two?
E_C2_Main_3_35,"Forget about wishes. What's the deal, do we pull up that tree by the roots?"
E_C2_Main_3_36,"You're going to a desert, but don't worry. We'll water you well."
E_C2_Main_3_37,....?!
E_C2_Main_3_38,"Whoa, wait! Wait!"
E_C2_Main_3_39,Are you people mad?
E_C2_Main_3_40,Sane people would think of their wishes first in situations like this!
E_C2_Main_3_41,Huh? The tree is talking differently now.
E_C2_Main_3_42,Was it pretending to be serious and solemn back then?
E_C2_Main_3_43,"Yes, it seems so..."
E_C2_Main_3_44,Hmm! Anyway...
E_C2_Main_3_45,You are the last visitors today.
E_C2_Main_3_46,"Now that the teams are set, everything is ready now."
E_C2_Main_3_47,"Normally, a team should only contain 2 or 3 people in it, but since I don't feel like thinking today, you can all move as a team."
E_C2_Main_3_48,You can choose 2 people to send out for battle. I think that should be alright.
E_C2_Main_3_49,???
E_C2_Main_3_50,Why should I team up with these wimps?
E_C2_Main_3_51,Why should I team up with this knucklehead?
E_C2_Main_3_52,Hahahaha...
E_C2_Main_3_53,I couldn't care less what you feel.
E_C2_Main_3_54,Only the last team standing could have their wish come true!
E_C2_Main_3_55,"Now, let the game begin."
E_C2_Main_3_56,That's it for explaining the rules. Teleport!
E_C2_Main_3_57,"Rejoice, good children of Christmas! Your wish will be granted!"
E_C2_Main_3_58,"Then, may luck be with you!"
E_C2_Main_3_59,"What, wait....."
E_C2_Main_3_60,Ugh... my head... Where am I...?
E_C2_Main_3_61,Is everyone all right?
E_C2_Main_3_62,"Huh, that tree, what did it do...?"
E_C2_Main_3_63,Hmm?
E_C2_Main_3_64,Kyahahahahaha!
E_C2_Main_3_65,I'll mop the floor with whoever gets in my way!
E_C2_Main_3_66,My wish will come true!
E_C2_Main_3_67,*Sigh* Why am I here?
E_C2_Main_3_68,I shouldn't leave Cleo alone for too long.
E_C2_Main_3_69,I promise it'll be quick!
E_C2_Main_3_70,"Hmph, know your place, human."
E_C2_Main_3_71,These jerks... I'll fry you with black lightning!
E_C2_Main_3_72,Bahahaha!
E_C2_Main_3_73,"Hmm, I think we don't have a choice."
E_C2_Main_3_74,"We can let 2 people in a battle, right?"
E_C2_Main_3_75,"Please Lilia, make sure Neraxis doesn't go on a rampage."
E_C2_Main_3_76,"Aww, every single time!"
E_C2_Main_4_1,"Argh, I could have become an adult again!"
E_C2_Main_4_2,Boo! I hate you!
E_C2_Main_4_3,"Phew, thank heavens it ended fast."
E_C2_Main_4_4,Cleo... you better not make me run petty errands like this again.
E_C2_Main_4_5,You're going to get in trouble...
E_C2_Main_4_6,"Tsk, they weren't half bad for humans."
E_C2_Main_4_7,"By the way, how many of these pointless fights do we have to do?"
E_C2_Main_4_8,This is killing me. I should have pulled that tree as soon as I found it!
E_C2_Main_4_9,"Don't be ignorant, you knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_4_10,Stop pushing and making this harder than it already is!
E_C2_Main_4_11,Those humans could have been seriously hurt!
E_C2_Main_4_12,Do you want to tarnish my sister's name?
E_C2_Main_4_13,"Stop calling me knucklehead, you brat!"
E_C2_Main_4_14,Don't you see me trying to control my powers here?
E_C2_Main_4_15,Look at that mess over there and say you're controlling your power again!
E_C2_Main_4_16,You've burnt everything! It's scorched everywhere!
E_C2_Main_4_17,!@#$%@#$%!!!
E_C2_Main_4_18,"Umm, it seems we're in a demiplane separated from our dimension,"
E_C2_Main_4_19,a world that we cannot escape unless we win or lose.
E_C2_Main_4_20,And a smaller barrier surrounds us when we encounter enemies.
E_C2_Main_4_21,Although it's gone after each battle ends...
E_C2_Main_4_22,"That is, we need to defeat all the other teams to escape this place as winners."
E_C2_Main_4_23,This is getting all too serious...
E_C2_Main_4_24,All I wanted to do was investigate the tree...
E_C2_Main_4_25,"Heh heh, you're strong, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_4_26,You'll be able to end this quickly!
E_C2_Main_4_27,"Oh, well... I guess so.. Hahaha.."
E_C2_Main_4_28,We do have two very feisty dragons on our side as well.
E_C2_Main_4_29,We'll work it out somehow.
E_C2_Main_4_30,Ahahaha.....
E_C2_Main_4_31,*Sigh*
E_C2_Main_4_32,"The two of you, please."
E_C2_Main_4_33,Stop causing
E_C2_Main_4_34,more trouble.
E_C2_Main_4_35,Heeeeek!
E_C2_Main_5_1,"So, to sum it up,"
E_C2_Main_5_2,we are in the demiplane created by the legendary tree.
E_C2_Main_5_3,"And there are others in a similar situation as us, whom we'd have to fight in order to get out."
E_C2_Main_5_4,"Yes, that seems like the only way to go."
E_C2_Main_5_5,We might find another way if we had more time...
E_C2_Main_5_6,"Aww, this is too much hassle!"
E_C2_Main_5_7,I just want to get this over with and go see Laias!
E_C2_Main_5_8,"Hahaha, your love for Laias never ceases to amaze me."
E_C2_Main_5_9,"There's nothing to worry about. If we work together,"
E_C2_Main_5_10,we can easily get to the bottom of this.
E_C2_Main_5_11,"Darn, I hate having to work together with this knucklehead."
E_C2_Main_5_12,"Right back at you! Do you think I enjoy working with you, brat?"
E_C2_Main_5_13,Ahahaha.....
E_C2_Main_5_14,Shouldn't we try to make them get along or something?
E_C2_Main_5_15,They're making me nervous.
E_C2_Main_5_16,"Well, as surprising as this may sound, they actually make a pretty good team."
E_C2_Main_5_17,"No matter how often they might argue over the smallest things, they both love Laias so much."
E_C2_Main_5_18,They would never do anything that would make Laias sad.
E_C2_Main_5_19,Laias...?
E_C2_Main_5_20,I think I've heard the name before...
E_C2_Main_5_21,"Oh, I think I read it in a book somewhere!"
E_C2_Main_5_22,I believe it was the book about the legends of Aegina Desert...
E_C2_Main_5_23,God Dragon Laias.
E_C2_Main_5_24,An ancient dragon that has been protecting the desert kingdom Sekireinel since forever ago...
E_C2_Main_5_25,"Beloved by Cain, the king of Sekireinel..."
E_C2_Main_5_26,Cain!?
E_C2_Main_5_27,"That little, pretentious human jerk? Yuck!"
E_C2_Main_5_28,He's been dead for hundreds of years and then gets brought back to life all of a sudden? All he does is talk!
E_C2_Main_5_29,"Every day, he keeps showing up at the Shrine of Flow and proposing to Laias!"
E_C2_Main_5_30,"Ewww, I feel sick just thinking about him."
E_C2_Main_5_31,That little fly! I should never have let him near Laias in the first place!
E_C2_Main_5_32,Zafir and Laudia don't visit us as much anymore!
E_C2_Main_5_33,It's all... because of that fly!
E_C2_Main_5_34,Haha... See?
E_C2_Main_5_35,Ahahaha.....
E_C2_Main_6_1,Umm? A building in a place like this?
E_C2_Main_6_2,I can see the light through the window. Could somebody be in there?
E_C2_Main_6_3,...!!
E_C2_Main_6_4,"...A barrier is cast over us, just like when we fought those two people."
E_C2_Main_6_5,There must be someone there.
E_C2_Main_6_6,"Well, enough talk! Let's get inside!"
E_C2_Main_6_7,I'm leading!
E_C2_Main_6_8,*Sigh* I'm going to kill...
E_C2_Main_6_9,Hahaha...
E_C2_Main_6_10,"Oh, they are..."
E_C2_Main_6_11,Eh? What? It's a Dwarf!
E_C2_Main_6_12,And a Vampire! They say there aren't many of them left.
E_C2_Main_6_13,"Oh, look who's here. And that weapon of yours..."
E_C2_Main_6_14,"I certainly know you by reputation, young Black Dragon."
E_C2_Main_6_15,"I heard that you placed some preposterous orders for my fellow Dwarves,"
E_C2_Main_6_16,"threatened them, and left without paying due price."
E_C2_Main_6_17,"Well, how about I teach a young dragon a thing or two about attitude? I've sure missed doing that!"
E_C2_Main_6_18,"Huh, don't mess with me, you old Dwarf!"
E_C2_Main_6_19,You have no idea what I'm capable o... Ouch!
E_C2_Main_6_20,"Stop that, knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_6_21,That Dwarf is an old acquaintance of my sister!
E_C2_Main_6_22,He is one of the heroes who defeated Mad Dragon Temeraire with her!
E_C2_Main_6_23,What the...? Whose side are you on now?
E_C2_Main_6_24,My sister's!
E_C2_Main_6_25,...Hmph!
E_C2_Main_6_26,"Whoa, Phillop, the last thing I want now is trouble."
E_C2_Main_6_27,I don't think I've fully recovered yet.
E_C2_Main_6_28,My head throbs when I hear noise.
E_C2_Main_6_29,"Oh, since when did the Vampires start to celebrate Christmas?"
E_C2_Main_6_30,"Princess of Pure Blood, Lewisia."
E_C2_Main_6_31,"Greetings from the Saint of Blessings, Lucias."
E_C2_Main_6_32,"Hmm, you are the Saint of Blessings for this generation."
E_C2_Main_6_33,What's there to be surprised at? I have lived among humans for the last 100 years.
E_C2_Main_6_34,I know how to celebrate Christmas.
E_C2_Main_6_35,"An old acquaintance... Is he Phillop, who fought along with those warriors 100 years ago?"
E_C2_Main_6_36,"That sounds about right. Lorraine should be here somewhere, but I haven't met her yet."
E_C2_Main_6_37,"Hm hm, anyway, the Saint of Blessings for this generation..."
E_C2_Main_6_38,"100 years ago, all the warriors and King Kyle received a lot of help from the one that preceded you."
E_C2_Main_6_39,"Haha, his memories reside in my mind. I'm familiar with that occasion."
E_C2_Main_6_40,...I bet it's frustrating.
E_C2_Main_6_41,"Carrying so much weight, though you only live so short."
E_C2_Main_6_42,"Previous saints, like all their predecessors, failed to bear the burden of accumulated memories in the end,"
E_C2_Main_6_43,"lost their free will, and ended up being the 'Will of Light.'"
E_C2_Main_6_44,"Unlike 'regular saints' such as the Saint in Red Clothes or the Saintess of Dragons, to whom humans gave their titles,"
E_C2_Main_6_45,the ones chosen by the Stigmata like yourself are...
E_C2_Main_6_46,I know. Those memories are in my head as well.
E_C2_Main_6_47,"But... I am fine, mentally. For now, anyway."
E_C2_Main_6_48,"This is the burden that I need to carry, and the ordeal that I have to overcome."
E_C2_Main_6_49,"Well, if that's how you think..."
E_C2_Main_6_50,"By the way, does being in the barrier mean we must fight each other?"
E_C2_Main_6_51,"Hahaha, I think that's how this is designed."
E_C2_Main_6_52,"But fortunately, I don't think it should be an all-out battle."
E_C2_Main_6_53,"I feel terrible for leaving without seeing Lorraine, but..."
E_C2_Main_6_54,I will look for her later.
E_C2_Main_6_55,"Then, shall we have a casual fight?"
E_C2_Main_6_56,"Hahaha! Come on, you novice dragon!"
E_C2_Main_6_57,Urgh!
E_C2_Main_6_58,*Sigh* I have no choice but to help you this time. You should be grateful!
E_C2_Main_6_59,"Hmph, who do you think I am? I am a member of the proud Black Dra..."
E_C2_Main_6_60,Whatever. Shut your trap and just fight!
E_C2_Main_6_61,...Are all dragons like them?
E_C2_Main_6_62,".....Heh heh, I'm not sure."
E_C2_Main_6_63,"So, we'll have to sit back and watch them fight."
E_C2_Main_6_64,We should have brought some snacks if this were to happen. Hahaha.
E_C2_Main_6_65,"Oh, we do have snacks. Popcorn, cookies, and other stuff."
E_C2_Main_6_66,"Oh, wonderful. Could I get some popcorn, please?"
E_C2_Main_6_67,Popcorn is always the way to go when you watch a bout or a show.
E_C2_Main_6_68,"I remember watching Stardust's performance, munching on popcorn. Hahaha..."
E_C2_Main_6_69,Krrrr!
E_C2_Main_7_1,"Argh, dang it!"
E_C2_Main_7_2,You little midget! You're quite nimble!
E_C2_Main_7_3,"Stop talking, you knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_7_4,Can you stop being so rude?!
E_C2_Main_7_5,"Mmph! Mmph! (You filthy, betraying brat!)"
E_C2_Main_7_6,That's definitely a weapon made by our best blacksmiths.
E_C2_Main_7_7,It's packed with power! Hahaha!
E_C2_Main_7_8,"By the way, I don't think it's appropriate for you to call me little,"
E_C2_Main_7_9,"especially when you're in your current form, not the original form of a dragon."
E_C2_Main_7_10,"Phew, It's finished."
E_C2_Main_7_11,"We lost, but it was fun."
E_C2_Main_7_12,"Even though he's young, he's still a dragon."
E_C2_Main_7_13,"I'm still not in my best condition,"
E_C2_Main_7_14,but it's great to have a good fight after so long.
E_C2_Main_7_15,"Hmm, you haven't been using your powers recently then?"
E_C2_Main_7_16,"Use my powers? Well, I'm usually in the form of a small child."
E_C2_Main_7_17,A woman who calls herself the Vampire Hunter started to hang out around me recently.
E_C2_Main_7_18,"Since Vampires in Luthvelia other than myself never cross the border, there shouldn't be any problem."
E_C2_Main_7_19,"However, it seems that Vampires in other continents have lost their pride."
E_C2_Main_7_20,To think that they've got a hunter chasing them as if they're a bunch of pests that need to be exterminated...
E_C2_Main_7_21,"Hmm, I think I've heard of something similar."
E_C2_Main_7_22,"There is a mysterious continent in the far east,"
E_C2_Main_7_23,where humans use beings of darkness like pawns
E_C2_Main_7_24,and exorcise evil for a living.
E_C2_Main_7_25,They seem to have a connection to the Vespia Empire.
E_C2_Main_7_26,That hunter in Orbis
E_C2_Main_7_27,is known to be a member of Shadow Hilt Family in Vespia Empire.
E_C2_Main_7_28,So I've heard.
E_C2_Main_7_29,We Dwarves also trade with the empire.
E_C2_Main_7_30,"Some families from the eastern continent,"
E_C2_Main_7_31,"have moved to and settled down in the empire, I heard."
E_C2_Main_7_32,"Oh, come to think of it, I think I've seen a lady from the east at the guild in Orvel."
E_C2_Main_7_33,"Her name was... Turan, I suppose."
E_C2_Main_7_34,She didn't seem to have any background in exorcism.
E_C2_Main_7_35,Hmm... I see.
E_C2_Main_7_36,"Ah, it's that tree again. Should we leave now, then?"
E_C2_Main_7_37,"Hahaha, let's get back to Orvel and eat."
E_C2_Main_7_38,"We couldn't find Lorraine, but she will come to Orvel if she can."
E_C2_Main_7_39,"Then, goodbye for now."
E_C2_Main_7_40,"Get ready to be spanked on the butt the next time you see me, Black Dragon kid. Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_7_41,What?
E_C2_Main_7_42,Get lost! I don't want to ever see you again!
E_C2_Main_7_43,"God, can't he be nice for once..?"
E_C2_Main_7_44,"Hahaha, what can you do? Black Dragons are known for their arrogance."
E_C2_Main_7_45,It'll be fun to watch him around an ill-tempered Red Dragon.
E_C2_Main_7_46,"Ewww, I get goosebumps just thinking about it!"
E_C2_Main_7_47,That would lead to a disaster!
E_C2_Main_8_1,"Now that we've had two battles already, how about we take a break for a while?"
E_C2_Main_8_2,We can sit around and rest since we're indoors.
E_C2_Main_8_3,"I'm all about resting, but this building is not warm enough."
E_C2_Main_8_4,Cold air is seeping through the windows.
E_C2_Main_8_5,I believe this outfit was enchanted to be weatherproof...
E_C2_Main_8_6,"Brrr, it's cold. Sonia, do you have handwarmers?"
E_C2_Main_8_7,Don't you still have a few left from last time?
E_C2_Main_8_8,"Yeah, one second. Where did I put...?"
E_C2_Main_8_9,Um? What's a handwarmer?
E_C2_Main_8_10,"Oh, it's this magical device I invented when I was in Grandpa Ricardo's orphanage."
E_C2_Main_8_11,It's nothing special. I put a metal plate engraved with a spell into a stone. It continuously lets out a weak electric current. That's all.
E_C2_Main_8_12,"That heats up the metal plate without melting it, and the stone becomes warm as well."
E_C2_Main_8_13,It helps you keep warm if you put the stone in your clothes or hold it in your hands.
E_C2_Main_8_14,"But... the heat doesn't last long, so I need to open the stone and recharge its power every once in a while."
E_C2_Main_8_15,Ah.. how creative!
E_C2_Main_8_16,I think I can make something similar with my blessing...
E_C2_Main_8_17,It would be a godsend for those working outside during cold winter days.
E_C2_Main_8_18,"And... Oh? Wait, did you say Ricardo?"
E_C2_Main_8_19,Eh? Do you know our Grandpa?
E_C2_Main_8_20,Of course! I was one of the Holy Knights under Sir Ricardo a few years back.
E_C2_Main_8_21,"Then, when I was chosen by the Stigmata from Goddess Lua,"
E_C2_Main_8_22,I had to leave his command to be the Saint.
E_C2_Main_8_23,"Wow, you were Grandpa's knight!"
E_C2_Main_8_24,You must have seen our Grandpa do great things!
E_C2_Main_8_25,"Hahaha, of course."
E_C2_Main_8_26,"Even in my vast layer of memories, it's difficult to find anyone else as great as him."
E_C2_Main_8_27,Huh? Who cares? He's just a human!
E_C2_Main_8_28,"But... I'd like to see that hand-warming thing, though."
E_C2_Main_8_29,Show it to me now.
E_C2_Main_8_30,Stop being condescending and just tell them that you're cold!
E_C2_Main_8_31,"Darn, you brat!"
E_C2_Main_8_32,Umm?
E_C2_Main_8_33,Another barrier?
E_C2_Main_8_34,"Oh, we were startled to see a building in a place like this."
E_C2_Main_8_35,We didn't know there were people that came before us.
E_C2_Main_8_36,"Tee hee, what unusual individuals do we have here?"
E_C2_Main_8_37,"Two from the great Dragon family,"
E_C2_Main_8_38,"the Saint of Blessings chosen by Lua,"
E_C2_Main_8_39,and the Blue Hurricane and her assistant...
E_C2_Main_8_40,"I don't know who you are,"
E_C2_Main_8_41,but I really hate it when someone calls me that. Please stop calling me that.
E_C2_Main_8_42,"Oops, excuse me... How should I address you then?"
E_C2_Main_8_43,"...Ms. Homunculus with the power of lightning, or..."
E_C2_Main_8_44,...!!
E_C2_Main_8_45,How did you know?
E_C2_Main_8_46,"Hohoho, don't look at me like that."
E_C2_Main_8_47,You can say that it's my job to... know stuff.
E_C2_Main_8_48,Psh..
E_C2_Main_8_49,*Giggle* Don't worry.
E_C2_Main_8_50,I don't make it a habit to reveal other people's secrets so frivolously.
E_C2_Main_8_51,"I came to Orvel to buy some potions and reagents from Mediana,"
E_C2_Main_8_52,and heard about the legendary tree. That's why we're here.
E_C2_Main_8_53,Well.. we didn't expect to be stuck in a barrier like this though..
E_C2_Main_8_54,"*Giggle* I wanted to take the sap of the legendary tree and see what I could make of it,"
E_C2_Main_8_55,but things turned out like this.
E_C2_Main_8_56,"By the way, dragons..."
E_C2_Main_8_57,Would you mind having your blood taken? A small amount?
E_C2_Main_8_58,I really need it for the research I'm currently working on!
E_C2_Main_8_59,...!!
E_C2_Main_8_60,Then... I'll take silence as a yes.
E_C2_Main_8_61,Don't worry! I have this needle made of dragon bone that Yanne gave me. You won't feel a thing!
E_C2_Main_8_62,"Kyaaaa, what is wrong with this human!?"
E_C2_Main_8_63,Dragon Slayer Weapon! Go away! Get lost!
E_C2_Main_8_64,"Ehhhhh, what is that!? That huge needle is made of dragon bone!"
E_C2_Main_8_65,Laias! A human is trying to eat me!
E_C2_Main_8_66,Fufufu.. It won't hurt. Just a little sting...
E_C2_Main_8_67,Kyaaaak!
E_C2_Main_9_1,"Ah, what a shame."
E_C2_Main_9_2,This is a bit less than I was hoping to get...
E_C2_Main_9_3,"But alright, it is what it is."
E_C2_Main_9_4,*Giggle* People don't know much about dragon's blood.
E_C2_Main_9_5,Please share if you find anything from your research!
E_C2_Main_9_6,"Sure, if it's for the development of medical science, I'll gladly share it."
E_C2_Main_9_7,"So, I have collected some dragon blood, and even tested a health drink..."
E_C2_Main_9_8,"As always, thank you! Fufu.."
E_C2_Main_9_9,Ewww... Needle! Needle!
E_C2_Main_9_10,"Aw, my head... That woman is crazy... She's a threat to all dragons..."
E_C2_Main_9_11,"...Umm, the dragons in the storybooks were scary..."
E_C2_Main_9_12,"I guess they're different in reality, Sonia!"
E_C2_Main_9_13,"Well, that's... Given the circumstances... Consider this a special case..."
E_C2_Main_9_14,Ahahaha.....
E_C2_Main_9_15,"...This might be a traumatic event for the two of them, don't you think?"
E_C2_Main_10_1,"Ewww, that sucked so bad! We should have left the building right after the battle!"
E_C2_Main_10_2,That female human with the needle! I'll break her in half if I see her again!
E_C2_Main_10_3,"Hahaha, calm down, Neraxis. It's just a small amount of blood."
E_C2_Main_10_4,"Patience is a virtue that you seem to be lacking, Neraxis."
E_C2_Main_10_5,"Don't you dare judge us dragon, Human."
E_C2_Main_10_6,"If it weren't for Laias, these two hands would have ki-"
E_C2_Main_10_7,"Hahaha, I'm sorry to hear that."
E_C2_Main_10_8,"Unlike someone, Lilia there has already wiped away her tears and started behaving like an adult."
E_C2_Main_10_9,"Well, as they say, Lilia is a more mature, well-behaved dragon, I suppose."
E_C2_Main_10_10,Urgh...!
E_C2_Main_10_11,...Hmph!
E_C2_Main_10_12,Ahahaha... He's playing with the dragons like they're some regular kids.
E_C2_Main_10_13,The world would be surprised to see what the Saint can actually do...
E_C2_Main_10_14,Um? Did you hear that?
E_C2_Main_10_15,...Wind? Leaves shaking?
E_C2_Main_10_16,"Long time, no see, Saint of Blessings."
E_C2_Main_10_17,"Greetings, Grand Elidoran Sage."
E_C2_Main_10_18,"You are in the company with Her Highness, Princess Selene."
E_C2_Main_10_19,"It's been a while, Lucias."
E_C2_Main_10_20,You are not with Brother Baudouin today.
E_C2_Main_10_21,"Hmph, an Elf."
E_C2_Main_10_22,"I've seen Dark Elves often, but it's my first time seeing an Elidoran Elf."
E_C2_Main_10_23,"I'm Selene, princess of Elidora."
E_C2_Main_10_24,"Greetings to the great tuners of nature, the ancient beings."
E_C2_Main_10_25,"I'm Lorraine, a Druid."
E_C2_Main_10_26,"Greetings to the great tuners of nature, the ancient beings."
E_C2_Main_10_27,"Raise your heads, Elves."
E_C2_Main_10_28,I'm still a young and immature dragon.
E_C2_Main_10_29,I don't feel comfortable being praised like that.
E_C2_Main_10_30,...Hmph.
E_C2_Main_10_31,"By the way, what brings the Elidoran elves to Orvel?"
E_C2_Main_10_32,"Oh, nothing special, actually."
E_C2_Main_10_33,"My sister, Dosarta, is responsible for guarding the Tower of Challenge."
E_C2_Main_10_34,She recently heard about a special festival called Christmas from a human visitor.
E_C2_Main_10_35,She seemed awfully bored these days.
E_C2_Main_10_36,"So, I wanted to experience Christmas, tell her about it and bring her some souvenirs."
E_C2_Main_10_37,I came here looking to learn about the legendary tree born from Rudolph's blood.
E_C2_Main_10_38,"I've been busy for the past 100 years, but I was able to spare some time this year."
E_C2_Main_10_39,But... look where we ended up.. hahaha..
E_C2_Main_10_40,"...In fact, we could have lost intentionally and escaped this place..."
E_C2_Main_10_41,"But then I sensed some energy of our kind, so we decided to stay."
E_C2_Main_10_42,Huh? Ah? Me?
E_C2_Main_10_43,Didn't we play volleyball together at the beach in the Summer Festival?
E_C2_Main_10_44,...What is your name?
E_C2_Main_10_45,"My name? Oh, I am Mirianne..."
E_C2_Main_10_46,"The light of your soul tells me... You are a Half Elf, about 12 years old."
E_C2_Main_10_47,The reason for your rapid growth was... a trauma to your soul.
E_C2_Main_10_48,Eh? I'm not following what you're saying... Um...
E_C2_Main_10_49,Give me your hand.
E_C2_Main_10_50,We'll talk about it later.
E_C2_Main_10_51,Hey!
E_C2_Main_10_52,"I'm not sure what you're up to,"
E_C2_Main_10_53,but Mirianne is feeling flustered. Will you give her some space?
E_C2_Main_10_54,"This doesn't concern you, Homunculus."
E_C2_Main_10_55,...! How did you...?
E_C2_Main_10_56,"...No, that's not the point!"
E_C2_Main_10_57,Not concern me? Nonsense!
E_C2_Main_10_58,Get your hands off my family!
E_C2_Main_11_1,"*Pant, pant* That was... a thrilling experience of lightning magic."
E_C2_Main_11_2,"...Hmm, this energy is..."
E_C2_Main_11_3,We have not heard your name yet.
E_C2_Main_11_4,...Sonia. No surname.
E_C2_Main_11_5,"Then, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_11_6,Are you aware of the power that you have?
E_C2_Main_11_7,"...Core of the Divine Beast, Baikal."
E_C2_Main_11_8,"I just know the name, not the details."
E_C2_Main_11_9,What about it?
E_C2_Main_11_10,There are words in ancient Elven literature.
E_C2_Main_11_11,"There was a time, more than ten million years ago,"
E_C2_Main_11_12,when the ancient species ruled over the world and the lands were covered with Mana energy.
E_C2_Main_11_13,"Civilizations were still immature, and small creatures like humans and Elves were not able to handle magic and elements."
E_C2_Main_11_14,Those who realized the secrets of the world acquired the power of truth that equaled the abilities of a god.
E_C2_Main_11_15,They were called 'Transcendants' and the creatures that they made became known as 'Divine Beasts.'
E_C2_Main_11_16,And among the Transcendants was one that could control thunder and lightning.
E_C2_Main_11_17,"His power was so strong that he created two Divine Beasts,"
E_C2_Main_11_18,"one of which was Baikal, and the other was Legios."
E_C2_Main_11_19,"After he disappeared, the beasts were set free..."
E_C2_Main_11_20,"The two Divine Beasts took different paths, and embarked on a journey to find their master."
E_C2_Main_11_21,No one knows what happened afterward...
E_C2_Main_11_22,"but somehow, Baikal seems to have ended up being your heart."
E_C2_Main_11_23,...
E_C2_Main_11_24,If what you're saying is true...
E_C2_Main_11_25,Was it the power of the Divine Beast that awakened my will?
E_C2_Main_11_26,I know it's rare for a Homunculus to have an ego.
E_C2_Main_11_27,That's beyond my knowledge.
E_C2_Main_11_28,Homunculus creation magic was the invention of a human wizard.
E_C2_Main_11_29,"There is a fundamental difference between the magic of humans and Elves, so I can't be sure."
E_C2_Main_11_30,But it is hard to say that they are not related.
E_C2_Main_11_31,...
E_C2_Main_11_32,Sonia...
E_C2_Main_11_33,"Umm, the barrier has been removed. We should be leaving soon."
E_C2_Main_11_34,There's no time. Please excuse me for a second.
E_C2_Main_11_35,"Don't worry, I don't intend to hurt you..."
E_C2_Main_11_36,Umm? Eh? What is this...?
E_C2_Main_11_37,The rapid growth of Half Elves is the result from the collision of human and Elf life force.
E_C2_Main_11_38,"You are not the first, and certainly not the last to suffer from it."
E_C2_Main_11_39,But according to what I saw a minute earlier...
E_C2_Main_11_40,Your case seems to be a very unstable one.
E_C2_Main_11_41,Do you have any memories before your rapid growth?
E_C2_Main_11_42,...No. I don't remember anything at all...
E_C2_Main_11_43,I believe that memory was what triggered your growth.
E_C2_Main_11_44,Rapid growth occurs to normal Half Elves around the age of fifteen.
E_C2_Main_11_45,But you seem to have grown into what you are now even before you turned ten.
E_C2_Main_11_46,"As if running away from something, sealing your memory."
E_C2_Main_11_47,"...And after the growth, no one treated you as a child."
E_C2_Main_11_48,Being both human and Elf.. you must have gone through a tough childhood. What a pity.
E_C2_Main_11_49,...
E_C2_Main_11_50,But it doesn't end there.
E_C2_Main_11_51,The sealed memory of yours... That remains in you as an anxiety and a negative energy gnawing upon your soul.
E_C2_Main_11_52,Do you not feel anxious all of a sudden in the middle of the night or when left alone?
E_C2_Main_11_53,...
E_C2_Main_11_54,You will have scars on your soul until you get to the bottom of your anxiety.
E_C2_Main_11_55,"But the progress seems slow, probably because of the good environment you've been in. Friends, family..."
E_C2_Main_11_56,But it is like a ticking time bomb. It is the trauma that will burst when you least expect it.
E_C2_Main_11_57,Bear that in mind.
E_C2_Main_11_58,"Unless you prepare to discover your true self,"
E_C2_Main_11_59,the day will come when your soul will be ruined forever.
E_C2_Main_11_60,"...Then, I think my time here is up. This is all I can do for you right now."
E_C2_Main_11_61,"Shall we, Your Highness?"
E_C2_Main_11_62,*Sigh* I guess I should find gifts for Dosarta somewhere else.
E_C2_Main_11_63,"Then, Mirianne. Until next time."
E_C2_Main_11_64,"I'm afraid this is all we can give you today,"
E_C2_Main_11_65,"but please, visit Elidora anytime."
E_C2_Main_11_66,"Then, we could speak more at length."
E_C2_Main_11_67,"If we can be of help, we would like to be."
E_C2_Main_11_68,"Though your nature is complex, you are still one of the children of the Elven family."
E_C2_Main_11_69,...
E_C2_Main_11_70,I... Umm...
E_C2_Main_11_71,Huh...? That's it?
E_C2_Main_11_72,Come on! That wasn't even a proper fight!
E_C2_Main_11_73,I didn't even get to do anything! I wanted to take all the credit for bringing the Christmas tree back!
E_C2_Main_11_74,*Sigh* That knucklehead never knows when to stop.
E_C2_Main_11_75,"We're a team, and you can't take all the credit for yourself."
E_C2_Main_11_76,"*Sigh* I have to say, Neraxis. I am disappointed."
E_C2_Main_11_77,You'll be a burden to Laias like this.
E_C2_Main_11_78,Wh-what!?
E_C2_Main_11_79,What did I do!?
E_C2_Main_11_80,...Hmp.
E_C2_Main_11_81,...Ehehheh.
E_C2_Main_11_82,...Wh-what! Why are you laughing!?
E_C2_Main_11_83,Seriously! What!?
E_C2_Main_12_1,"...Hmm, somehow, Neraxis's slow-wittedness relieved the tension in the air,"
E_C2_Main_12_2,"but still, it's boring to wander without knowing the destination."
E_C2_Main_12_3,"Neraxis, is it possible that you might have another joke for us to relax and laugh?"
E_C2_Main_12_4,"Leave me alone, damn it! I ain't your clown!"
E_C2_Main_12_5,"Oh hell, I would totally blow you little bugs up and go back to the desert,"
E_C2_Main_12_6,if only I had the chance!
E_C2_Main_12_7,I bet you wouldn't.
E_C2_Main_12_8,Can you imagine what Laias is going to say if you do that?
E_C2_Main_12_9,...Hmph. I know that.
E_C2_Main_12_10,*Grumble grumble*
E_C2_Main_12_11,*Sigh* How childish..
E_C2_Main_12_12,"By the way, how far do you think we'd have to go?"
E_C2_Main_12_13,"Well, I'm not sure."
E_C2_Main_12_14,We have no choice but to keep fighting.
E_C2_Main_12_15,"We can just lose if getting out is our first priority,"
E_C2_Main_12_16,but I don't think Neraxis will allow that to happen.. Hahaha...
E_C2_Main_12_17,"Well, I feel the same way. I want to get the tree for Laias,"
E_C2_Main_12_18,and want it to be the most special tree in the world.
E_C2_Main_12_19,I'm sure he feels that way too...
E_C2_Main_12_20,"Argh, He's such a troublesome guy!"
E_C2_Main_12_21,Waaaah!
E_C2_Main_12_22,?!
E_C2_Main_12_23,"Ouch, you knucklehead! What did you do now!?"
E_C2_Main_12_24,"You, Keuuuu, you did -"
E_C2_Main_12_25,...Uh oh?
E_C2_Main_12_26,What did I do?
E_C2_Main_12_27,"Oh, look who it is. Greetings to you, Yanne. We haven't met since you came back from Dragia with my sister."
E_C2_Main_12_28,"Oh, Lilia."
E_C2_Main_12_29,"Great to see you. Do something about Neraxis, please!"
E_C2_Main_12_30,He keeps growling like that... Did anything happen while I was not around?
E_C2_Main_12_31,I was just at the campsite north of Orvel
E_C2_Main_12_32,having a party with my friends who played Rudolph last year..
E_C2_Main_12_33,"And suddenly, the tree made a sound, and Rephy and I were dragged to this weird place!"
E_C2_Main_12_34,"Rephy, say something!"
E_C2_Main_12_35,Zzzzzz...
E_C2_Main_12_36,"Gosh, of course he falls asleep again after eating too much of grilled garlic and vegetables earlier."
E_C2_Main_12_37,...
E_C2_Main_12_38,"Yanne, do you by any chance know a woman called Mediana?"
E_C2_Main_12_39,Eh?
E_C2_Main_12_40,...Did Mediana do something?
E_C2_Main_12_41,Krrrr-
E_C2_Main_12_42,Heeeeek!
E_C2_Main_12_43,At least tell me the reason why you're mad!
E_C2_Main_12_44,Somebody could get hurt!
E_C2_Main_12_45,Zzzzzz... Eh? What's happening?
E_C2_Main_12_46,Healing? Do you want me to summon the souls and heal you?
E_C2_Main_12_47,Or should I blaze up some fire and stuff?
E_C2_Main_12_48,Just leave it all to me. A-hem!
E_C2_Main_12_49,"No, wait! Stop it, people! This is so chaotic!"
E_C2_Main_12_50,"Mmm, Popcorn is always the way to go while watching stuff."
E_C2_Main_12_51,I cannot agree with you more.. hehehe..
E_C2_Main_12_52,...
E_C2_Main_13_1,"Ummm, now I know what's going on."
E_C2_Main_13_2,"In short, the thing that I gave Mediana became a needle, right...?"
E_C2_Main_13_3,And she used it to sample your blood...
E_C2_Main_13_4,*Hiss*
E_C2_Main_13_5,"Hahaha, this is awkward."
E_C2_Main_13_6,"Well, Mediana couldn't have done it with bad intentions."
E_C2_Main_13_7,She is kind of a weirdo... but she's not a bad person.
E_C2_Main_13_8,I believe she needed dragon blood for her research on curing the dragons that went insane after Demon War.
E_C2_Main_13_9,And that's why I gave her the leftovers of Svelta's bone.
E_C2_Main_13_10,...?
E_C2_Main_13_11,Curing the Mad Dragons...?
E_C2_Main_13_12,Even magic couldn't cure their madness...
E_C2_Main_13_13,"Oh, Mediana's approach is somewhat different."
E_C2_Main_13_14,"It's medical science, the material or physical means of remedy that does not depend on magic..."
E_C2_Main_13_15,I'm not too sure how I should explain this.. hahaha.
E_C2_Main_13_16,"Anyway, Mediana, Phillop, and I are working together on it."
E_C2_Main_13_17,Our main goal at hand is to restore Temeraire from madness.
E_C2_Main_13_18,"Although various experiments are still underway, Mediana told me that she needed blood samples of dragons other than those of Red Dragons."
E_C2_Main_13_19,...Bringing that Temeraire back to normal?
E_C2_Main_13_20,Then... maybe Armarta could also be...
E_C2_Main_13_21,"(Eek, darn it. I've taken a few things from Armarta's repositorium...)"
E_C2_Main_13_22,"That's just our goal, but wouldn't it be nice if we can make it happen someday?"
E_C2_Main_13_23,I believe her coming here has something to with her ongoing research.
E_C2_Main_13_24,"Now that you mention it, she did mention her research when we encountered her."
E_C2_Main_13_25,"She didn't mention what the research was about, though."
E_C2_Main_13_26,"Hahaha, that's classic Mediana. She doesn't care about other things when she's focused on one thing."
E_C2_Main_13_27,It's like her tenacity is blocking everything else from her sight.
E_C2_Main_13_28,Hahaha... I think I know what you mean.
E_C2_Main_13_29,I heard there was a commotion about a health drink around Mediana's Tent this summer.
E_C2_Main_13_30,"Hehehe, the Summer Festival was so much fun."
E_C2_Main_13_31,I really enjoyed playing volleyball at the beach!
E_C2_Main_13_32,"*Sniff, sniff*"
E_C2_Main_13_33,This... this smells like home...
E_C2_Main_13_34,"Um? What is it, Rephy?"
E_C2_Main_13_35,Uh? N-nothing.
E_C2_Main_13_36,"It just smelled like home... I mean, Elidora!"
E_C2_Main_13_37,Home...is...for..sleeping...
E_C2_Main_13_38,Zzzzzz... Uncle Oddy... Where do you want to travel this time...?
E_C2_Main_13_39,*Sigh* That one might be a little too laid back. Hahaha.
E_C2_Main_13_40,"Well, I think our time is almost up."
E_C2_Main_13_41,The tree is trying to kick us out...
E_C2_Main_13_42,"Hahaha, I should get back to my party."
E_C2_Main_13_43,"Well, bye bye!"
E_C2_Main_13_44,"Neraxis, Lilia... Say hi to Laias for me, please!"
E_C2_Main_13_45,...
E_C2_Main_13_46,"...Phew. Hey, knucklehead. You did something wrong again, didn't you?"
E_C2_Main_13_47,"N-no, I didn't!"
E_C2_Main_13_48,...Hahahaha.
E_C2_Main_14_1,"U-um... It's gotten pretty dark, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_14_2,A demiplane created by a Christmas tree has weather and time?
E_C2_Main_14_3,What an astonishing place this is.
E_C2_Main_14_4,"...Or maybe, this meaningless fighting is about to end."
E_C2_Main_14_5,The legendary tree.. It's as magnificent as they say.
E_C2_Main_14_6,"By the way, I heard the tree grants our wishes... Well, nothing comes to mind, at least for now."
E_C2_Main_14_7,Delicious snacks and pretty clothes... We can just go buy all these things at Orvel.
E_C2_Main_14_8,"Well, none of us exactly came here bearing a desperate wish, to start with."
E_C2_Main_14_9,"Dragons came here to get a Christmas Tree,"
E_C2_Main_14_10,and that unfathomable priest doesn't seem to have earthly desires at all.
E_C2_Main_14_11,Mirianne and I were just looking to examine the tree.
E_C2_Main_14_12,"But... after we met Lorraine and Selene, I might have one in mind..."
E_C2_Main_14_13,"Oh, I think I know! You want a lead on the life magic of Homunculus, don't you?"
E_C2_Main_14_14,Or is it information about Baikal that you mentioned earlier?
E_C2_Main_14_15,"Well, either of them could work as a wish,"
E_C2_Main_14_16,but I don't think they're our first priority.
E_C2_Main_14_17,???
E_C2_Main_14_18,"Well, I didn't hear all the details about it from Grandpa,"
E_C2_Main_14_19,but I have other questions I want answers to.
E_C2_Main_14_20,"You... You're only twelve. You can act more like a child, and do whatever you like."
E_C2_Main_14_21,But... you are so mature and dedicated. You just work hard for others without caring about yourself.
E_C2_Main_14_22,...Are you really happy with your life?
E_C2_Main_14_23,Are you really okay like this?
E_C2_Main_14_24,I... I am not okay.
E_C2_Main_14_25,...
E_C2_Main_14_26,I have been thinking about it after hearing what Lorraine said.
E_C2_Main_14_27,I thought I had forgotten about it since it was a long time ago when we first started to travel together.
E_C2_Main_14_28,"You know, I'm a Homunculus, so I don't sleep."
E_C2_Main_14_29,"Yes, I know you don't need to sleep or eat, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_14_30,Your body heals itself as long as you breathe.
E_C2_Main_14_31,But you don't.
E_C2_Main_14_32,Your body is not artificially made. You were born in this world with a soul and life.
E_C2_Main_14_33,"Unlike me, you become tired and sleepy."
E_C2_Main_14_34,"...Every night, I watched you sleep."
E_C2_Main_14_35,"You were quivering, as if having a nightmare."
E_C2_Main_14_36,"But the next day, you were all smiles."
E_C2_Main_14_37,As if there was nothing wrong going on.
E_C2_Main_14_38,...That is...
E_C2_Main_14_39,"You are my only friend, assistant, and the only family I have except Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_14_40,"I like the other kids in the orphanage... Kasel, Frey, and Clause..."
E_C2_Main_14_41,"I like them all, but Grandpa and you are special to me."
E_C2_Main_14_42,I want to help you.
E_C2_Main_14_43,And I want to support you.
E_C2_Main_14_44,"All I know is how to fight,"
E_C2_Main_14_45,"but if there's anything I can do, I want to do it for you."
E_C2_Main_14_46,Sonia...
E_C2_Main_14_47,...
E_C2_Main_14_48,...Thank you.
E_C2_Main_14_49,...Hmph. This is awkward..!
E_C2_Main_14_50,"Ah, we should get ourselves out of here first."
E_C2_Main_14_51,We've fallen behind while talking. Let's hurry and catch up.
E_C2_Main_14_52,...Okay!
E_C2_Main_15_1,That boring barrier again.
E_C2_Main_15_2,"So, who's next!?"
E_C2_Main_15_3,Bring it on! Hurry up!
E_C2_Main_15_4,...
E_C2_Main_15_5,Oh? They look quite strong!
E_C2_Main_15_6,Alright! Time to battle!
E_C2_Main_15_7,Come on!
E_C2_Main_15_8,"Wait, Neraxis."
E_C2_Main_15_9,Argh!
E_C2_Main_15_10,Wh-what is it?
E_C2_Main_15_11,"Oh, it's just that..."
E_C2_Main_15_12,I happen to know both of them...
E_C2_Main_15_13,"Lucias? Hahahaha, long time no see!"
E_C2_Main_15_14,It's tough to see you after you've become the Saint.
E_C2_Main_15_15,"It's been a long time, Sir. It's good to see you as well."
E_C2_Main_15_16,I've been traveling all around Orbis. Hahaha.
E_C2_Main_15_17,I'm sorry I couldn't visit you more often.
E_C2_Main_15_18,"You're right, being well is a good thing! My well-being is preventing me from retirement though!! Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_15_19,"But recently, I've been doing a lot more paperwork at Orvel"
E_C2_Main_15_20,rather than going on expeditionary missions.
E_C2_Main_15_21,"It could be better, but at least I'm doing a good thing! Kehahaha!!"
E_C2_Main_15_22,"Hm hm, you haven't changed a bit."
E_C2_Main_15_23,"You are still Sir Ricardo, just as I remember you."
E_C2_Main_15_24,And your company... He's Kaulah.
E_C2_Main_15_25,"You were a great help a few months ago, Saint of Blessings."
E_C2_Main_15_26,"Without your blessing and healing,"
E_C2_Main_15_27,my brothers and sisters would still be struggling
E_C2_Main_15_28,to overcome the demonic infection and its aftereffects.
E_C2_Main_15_29,Did that demon Viska visit you afterward?
E_C2_Main_15_30,You told me that she played a key role in thwarting Malduk's assault and minimizing the damage.
E_C2_Main_15_31,"That's right, but I didn't see her yet afterward."
E_C2_Main_15_32,But why do you ask about her?
E_C2_Main_15_33,"Hmm, it still bothers me."
E_C2_Main_15_34,A demon dwelling in the body of a young girl.
E_C2_Main_15_35,I worry that there may be more demons residing among us without revealing themselves.
E_C2_Main_15_36,"I have seen a similar case when I traveled with Brother Baudouin, but... Hmm..."
E_C2_Main_15_37,"Hmm, I don't think we need to worry about Viska."
E_C2_Main_15_38,"However, we can't assume other demons are going to be the same case as hers."
E_C2_Main_15_39,We can never be too careful.
E_C2_Main_15_40,"By the way, Lucias, you have a couple of surprising companions."
E_C2_Main_15_41,"Hahaha! It's been a long time, Sonia! Mirianne!"
E_C2_Main_15_42,You look great! Good to see you.
E_C2_Main_15_43,...
E_C2_Main_15_44,"Hehehe, Grandpa! Long time no see!"
E_C2_Main_15_45,How have you been? Have you been eating well?
E_C2_Main_15_46,"You know you can't just eat meat all the time, don't you?"
E_C2_Main_15_47,"You're eating a fair amount of vegetables as well, aren't you?"
E_C2_Main_15_48,"Haha, hahaha... Sure, of course! Grandpa is not a picky eater!"
E_C2_Main_15_49,"*Clears throat* You are here to investigate the legendary tree, aren't you?"
E_C2_Main_15_50,"Mhm, pretty much."
E_C2_Main_15_51,"Did the Church send you to investigate it, too?"
E_C2_Main_15_52,Kehahaha! I'm afraid that wasn't the case.
E_C2_Main_15_53,"The Church heard that the Guild had already taken care of it, so they decided not to do anything."
E_C2_Main_15_54,I had no idea that you were the ones they sent though! Hahaha.
E_C2_Main_15_55,"To tell you the truth, I was so busy that I couldn't get a proper Christmas tree this year. What a shame."
E_C2_Main_15_56,So I wanted to present the kids in the orphanage the best tree ever in the world...
E_C2_Main_15_57,"Then, I met an acquaintance named Kaulah, who came to Orvel to get souvenirs for young Orcs,"
E_C2_Main_15_58,so I got some help to find the legendary tree.
E_C2_Main_15_59,But we ended up getting trapped in here. Kehahaha!
E_C2_Main_15_60,"Umm, I see..."
E_C2_Main_15_61,But Grandpa.
E_C2_Main_15_62,Hmm? What is it?
E_C2_Main_15_63,I have something to ask you.
E_C2_Main_15_64,...It's about Mirianne's memories.
E_C2_Main_15_65,...
E_C2_Main_15_66,"You just told me that Mirianne lost her memories, but not how that happened."
E_C2_Main_15_67,"But we just met Lorraine, the sage of Elidora Forest."
E_C2_Main_15_68,And she told us...
E_C2_Main_15_69,about... Mirianne's current condition.
E_C2_Main_15_70,"...So, you've finally figured it out."
E_C2_Main_15_71,But... I'm sorry. What I know might not be enough to answer all of your questions.
E_C2_Main_15_72,I only know what Mirianne was like just before I took her home...
E_C2_Main_15_73,"Anything before that, I do not know."
E_C2_Main_15_74,Just tell me everything you know.
E_C2_Main_15_75,For me... and for Mirianne. We really need this.
E_C2_Main_15_76,...
E_C2_Main_15_77,"In the past, I made a vow."
E_C2_Main_15_78,"Children I've taken in... my children... I vowed that I will keep them safe, no matter what."
E_C2_Main_15_79,This information might hurt Mirianne.
E_C2_Main_15_80,So I wasn't going to tell her for the rest of my life.
E_C2_Main_15_81,But we must know what happened in order to make a progress.
E_C2_Main_15_82,"If not, Mirianne won't have any courage to move forward."
E_C2_Main_15_83,Her soul cannot be complete without knowing her past.
E_C2_Main_15_84,...
E_C2_Main_15_85,"...Grandpa, please."
E_C2_Main_15_86,Mirianne...
E_C2_Main_15_87,I want to know.
E_C2_Main_15_88,My past... the forgotten memories.
E_C2_Main_15_89,I need to know them to start over again.
E_C2_Main_15_90,I'll embrace all of my pain and agony...
E_C2_Main_15_91,I'm scared and anxious...
E_C2_Main_15_92,But I can't stay like this. I need to move forward.
E_C2_Main_15_93,...
E_C2_Main_15_94,If that's what you want... I have no other choice.
E_C2_Main_15_95,But I'm afraid I can't tell you just like that.
E_C2_Main_15_96,Grandpa!
E_C2_Main_15_97,"For the first time in years, it's sparring time with Grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_15_98,"Sonia, Mirianne! Get yourselves ready."
E_C2_Main_15_99,If you can defeat me...
E_C2_Main_15_100,"If you can prove how much you have grown,"
E_C2_Main_15_101,I will tell you all about it.
E_C2_Main_15_102,"...Watch out, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_15_103,I've gotten a lot stronger.
E_C2_Main_15_104,...I will not lose!
E_C2_Main_15_105,"I, too, worked hard to be strong like Sonia!"
E_C2_Main_15_106,...Hahahaha.
E_C2_Main_15_107,"You make me proud, my children."
E_C2_Main_15_108,"...Well, come on!"
E_C2_Main_15_109,Woooo!
E_C2_Main_16_1,Whew.
E_C2_Main_16_2,Both of you have grown stronger.
E_C2_Main_16_3,This is my first defeat in my life.
E_C2_Main_16_4,"Hahaha, maybe Grandpa is getting old now."
E_C2_Main_16_5,...I know you let us win.
E_C2_Main_16_6,"You never swung your pillar with full strength, not once."
E_C2_Main_16_7,"She's right, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_16_8,It was so obvious that you went easy on us.
E_C2_Main_16_9,...Kehahaha! I guess you've become skilled enough to notice that..!
E_C2_Main_16_10,"Well, what choice did I have? I don't want my granddaughters hurt."
E_C2_Main_16_11,It was enough for me to see your determination.
E_C2_Main_16_12,"Kaulah, thank you for helping me."
E_C2_Main_16_13,"Hahaha, no worries. It was nothing compared to what you've done for the Orcs."
E_C2_Main_16_14,You were the one who sent the Holy Knights to settle the situation in Ogria.
E_C2_Main_16_15,"Thanks to you, the reconstruction of the Orc towns is well underway."
E_C2_Main_16_16,"Hahaha, it's good to hear that."
E_C2_Main_16_17,"I know we still have disputes between humans and Orcs,"
E_C2_Main_16_18,but I believe they should not be passed down to the next generations.
E_C2_Main_16_19,"The number of knights I requested was a little too high, even for my standards, but I wanted to give as much help as I could..."
E_C2_Main_16_20,"But luckily, Great Priestess Iris agreed with my opinion."
E_C2_Main_16_21,"You know how they say, there's nothing like peace. Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_16_22,"So, what about Mirianne's story?"
E_C2_Main_16_23,"Ah, right. I'm sorry I went off on a tangent."
E_C2_Main_16_24,...I will tell you everything that I know.
E_C2_Main_16_25,But do bear in mind that there are some missing parts that I don't know about.
E_C2_Main_16_26,You'll have to fill the rest yourselves.
E_C2_Main_16_27,"Yes, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_16_28,Don't worry.
E_C2_Main_16_29,I'm stronger now.
E_C2_Main_16_30,"...Yes, alright."
E_C2_Main_16_31,"...Then, I must begin with the Half Elves."
E_C2_Main_16_32,"After I've taken Mirianne in, I did some research on Half Elves."
E_C2_Main_16_33,It's very rare for a human and an Elf to have a child together.
E_C2_Main_16_34,"Also, since an Elf's lifespan is a few hundred times longer than a human's, you'll almost never see the two races fall for each other."
E_C2_Main_16_35,"However, Elidoran Elves have many interactions with humans,"
E_C2_Main_16_36,and there have been some cases where a human from Orvelia and an Elidoran Elf got together.
E_C2_Main_16_37,"But... Elves have a difficult time living in a human society, and vice versa."
E_C2_Main_16_38,So even if a Half Elf is born from the couple...
E_C2_Main_16_39,Neither societies are suitable for the child to grow up in.
E_C2_Main_16_40,"...Hmm, I never knew that..."
E_C2_Main_16_41,"...Therefore, some decades ago, a few human-Half Elf couples agreed upon a common purpose and went off to find a place they could rebuild their lives."
E_C2_Main_16_42,They made a town between Elidora Forest and King's Plains.
E_C2_Main_16_43,That was... Mirianne's home.
E_C2_Main_16_44,A town called... Ella.
E_C2_Main_16_45,...Ella.
E_C2_Main_16_46,...!
E_C2_Main_16_47,The town of Ella...
E_C2_Main_16_48,"Mmm. Lucias, you would know it."
E_C2_Main_16_49,"You were in the Holy Knights, then."
E_C2_Main_16_50,"...6 years ago, the Holy Knights received a report."
E_C2_Main_16_51,There was an indication of Darkness near Elidora Forest.
E_C2_Main_16_52,"So, the Holy Knights were patrolling around the boundary between King's Plains and Elidora Forest."
E_C2_Main_16_53,"And at some point, there was a thick, dark fog over the horizon."
E_C2_Main_16_54,...I led the Holy Knights and headed down to the fog as fast as I could.
E_C2_Main_16_55,...What we found was a terrible sight.
E_C2_Main_16_56,The small town was burnt down to ashes.
E_C2_Main_16_57,"Elves, Human, Half Elves. All dead."
E_C2_Main_16_58,"I could see at a glimpse it was the Demons that did it, without a doubt."
E_C2_Main_16_59,Violence without reason. Massacre. Killing for pleasure.
E_C2_Main_16_60,...No one should experience that... ever.
E_C2_Main_16_61,...
E_C2_Main_16_62,Sir Ricardo told us to recover the bodies scattered around the town.
E_C2_Main_16_63,Bodies that became unrecognizable from excessive mutilation....
E_C2_Main_16_64,Even the ones in better condition were very painful to watch.
E_C2_Main_16_65,"But... while we were recovering bodies for cremation,"
E_C2_Main_16_66,Lua showed us only one miracle that day.
E_C2_Main_16_67,Beneath the bodies of an Elven woman and human man...
E_C2_Main_16_68,There was a little girl.
E_C2_Main_16_69,"She seemed shocked, and was quivering, but she was alive."
E_C2_Main_16_70,That was you... Mirianne.
E_C2_Main_16_71,...!
E_C2_Main_16_72,Your name was engraved on the pendant that you were wearing.
E_C2_Main_16_73,"A wooden pendant with a magical stone, handmade with a delicate touch..."
E_C2_Main_16_74,"That must have protected you from the fire and smoke, as we believed."
E_C2_Main_16_75,"But the moment we took you to safety, the pendant cracked and turned into dust."
E_C2_Main_16_76,As if it had completed its role...
E_C2_Main_16_77,Mother... Father...
E_C2_Main_16_78,You were then so shocked by the horror...
E_C2_Main_16_79,"When we asked you how old you were, you showed us fingers but couldn't speak at all."
E_C2_Main_16_80,You were six. A six-year-old girl saw her parents burn to death right before her...
E_C2_Main_16_81,"Rage, compassion, sadness... Emotions were swirling in my head."
E_C2_Main_16_82,"But above all things, I had one thing in my mind, and that was to protect you and keep you safe."
E_C2_Main_16_83,Then... the rest is as you know.
E_C2_Main_16_84,"I brought Mirianne to the Orphanage, laid her in bed, and went to talk with the staff there."
E_C2_Main_16_85,"Then, I saw a great light exploding in Mirianne's room."
E_C2_Main_16_86,I was surprised and ran up to your room.
E_C2_Main_16_87,"What I saw there was... you. All grown up, smiling at me with all your memories forgotten."
E_C2_Main_16_88,...I was confused. What could have happened...?
E_C2_Main_16_89,"But inwardly, I felt it might be better for you."
E_C2_Main_16_90,The fact that you wouldn't need to carry that dark memory with you...
E_C2_Main_16_91,But you ended up finding the truth after all.
E_C2_Main_16_92,That's...
E_C2_Main_16_93,...
E_C2_Main_16_94,"Thank you, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_16_95,It must have been very hard for you to tell me these things...
E_C2_Main_16_96,"...Are you okay, Mirianne?"
E_C2_Main_16_97,I know this must be hard for you to take in.
E_C2_Main_16_98,"...To be completely honest, I'm not so sure."
E_C2_Main_16_99,"It doesn't feel like reality, maybe because I have no memories of it."
E_C2_Main_16_100,Or maybe there is too much information for me to take in and handle..
E_C2_Main_16_101,But...
E_C2_Main_16_102,I want to visit there.
E_C2_Main_16_103,Ella... The town where my parents rest...
E_C2_Main_16_104,"Once I get there,"
E_C2_Main_16_105,maybe I can figure something out.
E_C2_Main_16_106,"...Hahaha, you did become strong, Mirianne."
E_C2_Main_16_107,"You're only twelve, but you're very mature."
E_C2_Main_16_108,"I'm sorry... I wanted to let you have the happiest and most beautiful childhood,"
E_C2_Main_16_109,"but you grew up so fast, you ended up helping with errands at the orphanage in the end."
E_C2_Main_16_110,I am so sorry...
E_C2_Main_16_111,"...Heh heh, it's really fine, Grandpa. I helped because I wanted to."
E_C2_Main_16_112,It was that orphanage that took me in and accepted me as a family.
E_C2_Main_16_113,"And... thanks to your story, I can now move a tiny step forward."
E_C2_Main_16_114,I'm glad to hear that... really glad.
E_C2_Main_16_115,"...Umm, by the way, that might have been the last battle."
E_C2_Main_16_116,Both the barrier and the demiplane are vanishing now.
E_C2_Main_16_117,Hahaha. Is that so?
E_C2_Main_16_118,"It's a shame that I don't get to take this tree, but well."
E_C2_Main_16_119,I should find another tree to show our kids.
E_C2_Main_16_120,"Sonia, Mirianne! Come visit your brothers and sisters if you have time."
E_C2_Main_16_121,The orphanage is always open.
E_C2_Main_16_122,"...Yes, Grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_16_123,"...Heh, stay well. I'll bring a lot of gifts!"
E_C2_Main_17_1,"Congratulations, Warriors of Christmas."
E_C2_Main_17_2,"In return, you shall have one wish granted."
E_C2_Main_17_3,Consider and decide.
E_C2_Main_17_4,...
E_C2_Main_17_5,Hey?
E_C2_Main_17_6,Are you listening?
E_C2_Main_17_7,Hey!
E_C2_Main_17_8,...
E_C2_Main_17_9,"Umm, Neraxis?"
E_C2_Main_17_10,Why are you so quiet?
E_C2_Main_17_11,...Shut up! Don't bother!
E_C2_Main_17_12,"...Hmph, I shouldn't be feeling like this over some half-bloods."
E_C2_Main_17_13,"Darn it, I don't need anything!"
E_C2_Main_17_14,Just take it all away! Wishes or whatnot!
E_C2_Main_17_15,"Oh, this is something unexpected..."
E_C2_Main_17_16,What on earth is going on?
E_C2_Main_17_17,"Neraxis, since when did a knucklehead like you become so thoughtful?"
E_C2_Main_17_18,Shut it! I'll kill you!
E_C2_Main_17_19,"Phew, don't be shy."
E_C2_Main_17_20,What a child.
E_C2_Main_17_21,You little brat!
E_C2_Main_17_22,"Argh, this feels awkward as hell!"
E_C2_Main_17_23,...Eh? Huuuuuh?
E_C2_Main_17_24,Hey! Say your wish before I change my mind!
E_C2_Main_17_25,"Darn, I won't say it twice!"
E_C2_Main_17_26,"*Gasp, gasp*"
E_C2_Main_17_27,...Mirianne.
E_C2_Main_17_28,A wish...
E_C2_Main_17_29,Hmm...
E_C2_Main_17_30,"Then, Mr. Tree."
E_C2_Main_17_31,Let all the people we fought today
E_C2_Main_17_32,have a happy time... and a wonderful Christmas.
E_C2_Main_17_33,And...
E_C2_Main_17_34,Send the nicest Christmas trees around
E_C2_Main_17_35,to Grandpa Ricardo's orphanage and to Neraxis and Lilia's homes.
E_C2_Main_17_36,Heh heh.
E_C2_Main_17_37,...
E_C2_Main_17_38,Your wish will be granted.
E_C2_Main_17_39,...Are you sure that's your wish?
E_C2_Main_17_40,"Yes, I'll be happy with that."
E_C2_Main_17_41,My wish is something I have to make come true on my own.
E_C2_Main_17_42,"Right, Sonia?"
E_C2_Main_17_43,...Hahaha.
E_C2_Main_17_44,As expected of you.. Mirianne.
E_C2_Main_17_45,"You're always kind, unselfish, and caring..."
E_C2_Main_17_46,"...Aw, I do have some selfishness."
E_C2_Main_17_47,"I love pretty clothes, and I always want to have yummy snacks."
E_C2_Main_17_48,"But... I can do all of that with you anytime, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_17_49,I can't possibly want more than that.
E_C2_Main_17_50,I will find my past and memory.. by myself.
E_C2_Main_17_51,So.. this is for the best.
E_C2_Main_17_52,Heh heh.
E_C2_Main_17_53,"...Oh, Lua."
E_C2_Main_17_54,The most beautiful thing in the world is...
E_C2_Main_17_55,"a pure, innocent soul."
E_C2_Main_17_56,I wish you could learn some of her... Neraxis!
E_C2_Main_17_57,"What? No! No Christmas tree at my place, no!"
E_C2_Main_17_58,?????
E_C2_Main_17_59,Is it done? Has everything come true?
E_C2_Main_17_60,Well... Umm... Yes...?
E_C2_Main_17_61,You can't take it back.
E_C2_Main_17_62,"Well, what a bummer. But I guess it can't be helped."
E_C2_Main_17_63,Kehkehkeh...
E_C2_Main_17_64,I guess we could use an extra tree! Kuhahahaha!
E_C2_Main_17_65,*Sigh* I knew it.
E_C2_Main_17_66,"Now for revenge! I'll be pulling you out of the ground, Tree! You're my Christmas Tree!"
E_C2_Main_17_67,The tree I received from the wish is just a freebie!!
E_C2_Main_17_68,You'll become the coolest tree that I'm going to bring as the main gift to Laias!!
E_C2_Main_17_69,Ewaaaah?
E_C2_Main_17_70,Wh-what are you doing...!? Argh! Ewaaah! No! My roots! Somebody help the tree!
E_C2_Main_17_71,"...Oh, Lua."
E_C2_Main_17_72,"Please save this pitiful soul of a dragon,"
E_C2_Main_17_73,filled with nothing but greed and arrogance...
E_C2_Main_17_74,"I'll pull you by the roots, you bastard!"
E_C2_Main_17_75,Kyaaaaaaahhh!
E_C2_Main_17_76,...
E_C2_Main_17_77,How... How dare you pull me out!?
E_C2_Main_17_78,There'll be no Christmas presents for naughty children like you!
E_C2_Main_17_79,Die!
E_C2_Main_17_80,"Arghhh, you knucklehead! What'd you do!?"
E_C2_Main_17_81,"Kwahahaha, that's what I expected!"
E_C2_Main_17_82,"Come on, you freakin' tree!"
E_C2_Main_17_83,"I'll bring you back with me, no matter what!"
E_C2_Main_6_16_plus,zZZ...
E_C19_Aegina01_01,...
E_C19_Aegina01_02,Meow?
E_C19_Aegina01_03,"...Do you feel it, Hoabis?"
E_C19_Aegina01_04,An ominous wind blows from the Grave of the God King.
E_C19_Aegina01_05,What is coming after the demon attacks...?
E_C19_Aegina01_06,Meow.
E_C19_Aegina01_07,...
E_C19_Aegina01_08,"Zafir? There you are, Zafir."
E_C19_Aegina01_09,"Ah, Laudia."
E_C19_Aegina01_10,How is Laias doing?
E_C19_Aegina01_11,"Ah, she's recovering."
E_C19_Aegina01_12,She just used up a lot of her power. She's better now.
E_C19_Aegina01_13,That's good to hear.
E_C19_Aegina01_14,How are Neraxis and Lilia?
E_C19_Aegina01_15,"Ah, well..."
E_C19_Aegina01_16,Darn it! Stop getting in the way!
E_C19_Aegina01_17,I'm going to kill that Infira with my own hands!
E_C19_Aegina01_18,Kwaaaaaah!!!
E_C19_Aegina01_19,That sneaky little fool! How dare he try to gang up on me!?
E_C19_Aegina01_20,He's dead!
E_C19_Aegina01_21,"Ugh, you knucklehead!"
E_C19_Aegina01_22,Hey! Don't go in alone and get beat up again!
E_C19_Aegina01_23,Sis is going to worry!
E_C19_Aegina01_24,...
E_C19_Aegina01_25,"Mm, ahem..."
E_C19_Aegina01_26,"I-If that's the case, I'll stop..."
E_C19_Aegina01_27,(Ughhh)
E_C19_Aegina01_28,"...*Sigh*. Fine, I'll overlook it this time."
E_C19_Aegina01_29,Since you saved my sister and me from getting hurt...
E_C19_Aegina01_30,"Huh? What are you saying, you little brat?"
E_C19_Aegina01_31,"Hey! I should protect Laias, but why would I do the same for you?"
E_C19_Aegina01_32,Arghhhh!
E_C19_Aegina01_33,Hey! Stop right there!
E_C19_Aegina01_34,"Catch me if you can! With your short legs and small wings, I doubt it!"
E_C19_Aegina01_35,"*Blows raspberry*, hmph!"
E_C19_Aegina01_36,...Mmm.
E_C19_Aegina01_37,As expected of Neraxis. The injury was just a scratch for him.
E_C19_Aegina01_38,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Aegina01_39,"I was still really surprised, though."
E_C19_Aegina01_40,When Neraxis came back with those injuries...
E_C19_Aegina01_41,"Lilia healed him by wrapping him up in a bubble, right?"
E_C19_Aegina01_42,"Although they're always fighting, they must have some kind of bond."
E_C19_Aegina01_43,"...Well, this is all thanks the Priestess of Water as well."
E_C19_Aegina01_44,"Ahaha, Laias is indeed great."
E_C19_Aegina01_45,"But Zafir, what's with the serious face?"
E_C19_Aegina01_46,Did something happen?
E_C19_Aegina01_47,...I'm going to have to scout out the Grave of the God King.
E_C19_Aegina01_48,I can sense a strange sign... from the desert sandstorm.
E_C19_Aegina02_01,"Laias, how are you feeling?"
E_C19_Aegina02_02,"Ah, Zafir and Laudia."
E_C19_Aegina02_03,"Welcome. As you can see, I'm alright."
E_C19_Aegina02_04,"It hasn't been too long since I woke from my long slumber, so I just can't fully utilize my powers yet..."
E_C19_Aegina02_05,That's good to hear.
E_C19_Aegina02_06,I just came here to tell you that... I'm going to have to leave for a while.
E_C19_Aegina02_07,...Did something happen?
E_C19_Aegina02_08,A strange wind is blowing from the Grave of the God King... It's the sacred ground of the Mauhata tribe.
E_C19_Aegina02_09,Guarding the grave is the duty of the Mauhata Chief.
E_C19_Aegina02_10,"However, something must have happened when the security weakened"
E_C19_Aegina02_11,after the entire tribe moved out to the Shrine of Flow to fight the demons.
E_C19_Aegina02_12,Nothing should have happened since the grave is enchanted with a powerful seal...
E_C19_Aegina02_13,But it's just that I have a bad feeling about this.
E_C19_Aegina02_14,"...Mm, I understand what you're saying."
E_C19_Aegina02_15,"Then, please take Laudia with you as well."
E_C19_Aegina02_16,I'm sure she can help you out.
E_C19_Aegina02_17,"Is that okay with you, Priestess?"
E_C19_Aegina02_18,Aren't you short-handed here..?
E_C19_Aegina02_19,"Ha ha, it's fine."
E_C19_Aegina02_20,"Phillop and Theo are helping out,"
E_C19_Aegina02_21,so we'll be fine here for a while.
E_C19_Aegina02_22,"I would love to go with you as well,"
E_C19_Aegina02_23,but Temeraire...
E_C19_Aegina02_24,"Don't worry, Laias."
E_C19_Aegina02_25,"Even if something did happen, I'll take care of it quickly and come back."
E_C19_Aegina02_26,Farewell...
E_C19_Aegina02_27,...
E_C19_Aegina02_28,"The Grave of the God King, huh?"
E_C19_Aegina03_01,"We're here, Hoabis. It's home."
E_C19_Aegina03_02,Huh? Why are you sniffing around like that?
E_C19_Aegina03_03,Do you smell something?
E_C19_Aegina03_04,Meooow!
E_C19_Aegina03_05,"Come to think of it, I remember visiting the Mauhata tribe with my father when I was young."
E_C19_Aegina03_06,But I've never been anywhere near the Grave of the God King.
E_C19_Aegina03_07,Isn't God King Cain the ancestor of Zafir?
E_C19_Aegina03_08,"Yes, that is correct."
E_C19_Aegina03_09,"The God King of Sekireinel, Cain."
E_C19_Aegina03_10,There are many historians who consider him as a tyrant.
E_C19_Aegina03_11,"However, he was actually a brilliant and a wise king who led all of Aegina to prosperity."
E_C19_Aegina03_12,Shaaaaa!
E_C19_Aegina03_13,...!!!
E_C19_Aegina03_14,Those are... Undead?
E_C19_Aegina03_15,But how are they here...?
E_C19_Aegina03_16,It looks like someone definitely broke the seal...
E_C19_Aegina03_17,And those aren't just ordinary Undead.
E_C19_Aegina03_18,Someone desecrated the mummies of the ancient warriors and priests.
E_C19_Aegina03_19,...Unforgivable.
E_C19_Aegina04_01,"Ancestors, please forgive me for using this power against you."
E_C19_Aegina04_02,"May you rest in peace, once again."
E_C19_Aegina04_03,Now... rest. Within the desert!
E_C19_Aegina04_04,"Hm... no matter how many times I witness it, that's such an extraordinary power."
E_C19_Aegina04_05,How are the sands being controlled? It's not even magic.
E_C19_Aegina04_06,It's the authority of the God King who ruled over all of the deserts.
E_C19_Aegina04_07,But even I don't know how he obtained this power...
E_C19_Aegina04_08,I just had it ever since I was born.
E_C19_Aegina04_09,Meooow!
E_C19_Aegina04_10,"Ah, Hoabis!"
E_C19_Aegina04_11,It's dangerous if you run out front alone...!
E_C19_Aegina05_01,*Huff* *Huff*
E_C19_Aegina05_02,Cats are really fast...
E_C19_Aegina05_03,Umm?
E_C19_Aegina05_04,Ack! Ack! What's with this cat!?
E_C19_Aegina05_05,"It's cute, but, ack! Stop hitting me!"
E_C19_Aegina05_06,Ahh! What this violent cat!?
E_C19_Aegina05_07,"Hey, human! Help!"
E_C19_Aegina05_08,...
E_C19_Aegina05_09,...
E_C19_Aegina05_10,Are you the ones who raised the Undead here...?
E_C19_Aegina05_11,Huh? Of course not!
E_C19_Aegina05_12,I just heard that there's a lot of gold here...
E_C19_Aegina05_13,"Ow! Aw, why are you hitting me, kitty?"
E_C19_Aegina05_14,Kya! I here because she want together!
E_C19_Aegina05_15,She said buy me gunpowder with gold! 
E_C19_Aegina05_16,And Undead came. I bomb them.
E_C19_Aegina05_17,"...Hm, so you don't know anything about the Undead,"
E_C19_Aegina05_18,"but you admit that you're all gravediggers, right?"
E_C19_Aegina05_19,...
E_C19_Aegina05_20,Run! / I go!
E_C19_Aegina05_21,Nope!!
E_C19_Aegina06_01,Aww... I'm sorry...
E_C19_Aegina06_02,Kyaa...
E_C19_Aegina06_03,"Ha ha, such cute kids."
E_C19_Aegina06_04,"...Then, how about this?"
E_C19_Aegina06_05,"If you need gold, we'll get you some later."
E_C19_Aegina06_06,"However, we'd like to ask for your help right now..."
E_C19_Aegina06_07,!!!
E_C19_Aegina06_08,We need to find out who's been raising the Undead first.
E_C19_Aegina06_09,Will you help?
E_C19_Aegina06_10,Okay! / I do!
E_C19_Aegina06_11,"Ha ha, so cute."
E_C19_Aegina06_12,"What do you think, Zafir?"
E_C19_Aegina06_13,"We need all the help we can get, right?"
E_C19_Aegina06_14,And we don't know how many Undeads there are.
E_C19_Aegina06_15,"These kids seem capable of putting up a fight, too."
E_C19_Aegina06_16,I don't like it... But it is true that we desperately need all the help we can get.
E_C19_Aegina06_17,"*Sigh*... If that's what you want, Laudia. Let's do it."
E_C19_Aegina06_18,But please don't touch the gold inside the grave.
E_C19_Aegina06_19,"Once this is over, our tribe will share some of the gold we gathered."
E_C19_Aegina06_20,Hoo! Awesome!
E_C19_Aegina06_21,"Let's go, Miruru Pirates!"
E_C19_Aegina06_22,Kyakyakya! Research money!
E_C19_Aegina06_23,"...*Whew* I'm already starting to get a headache, Hoabis."
E_C19_Aegina06_24,Mya?
E_C19_Aegina07_01,...
E_C19_Aegina07_02,Traces of the Undead.
E_C19_Aegina07_03,And the concentration of darkness mixed in the sand is...
E_C19_Aegina07_04,"Everyone, prepare for battle."
E_C19_Aegina07_05,"Alright, my cannon will take care of everything in a single shot!"
E_C19_Aegina07_06,"Bring it, white goblin!"
E_C19_Aegina07_07,Let's see whose cannon is better!
E_C19_Aegina07_08,Kya! I no lose!
E_C19_Aegina07_09,Lakrak hand cannon world best!
E_C19_Aegina07_10,...It's nice to see you're all motivated.
E_C19_Aegina07_11,"But if I catch you destroying or stealing from any graves, I'm sending you to desert hell immediately."
E_C19_Aegina07_12,Is that clear?
E_C19_Aegina07_13,"*Cough, cough*"
E_C19_Aegina08_01,Mya?
E_C19_Aegina08_02,Mya!
E_C19_Aegina08_03,"What is it, Hoabis?"
E_C19_Aegina08_04,Do you smell the Undead or something?
E_C19_Aegina08_05,...
E_C19_Aegina08_06,Hey.
E_C19_Aegina08_07,Eh? What?
E_C19_Aegina08_08,They're not looking right now.
E_C19_Aegina08_09,Don't you think we can sneak some?
E_C19_Aegina08_10,"And we can take the gold they give us later, too!"
E_C19_Aegina08_11,Kya... Good idea.
E_C19_Aegina08_12,How this?
E_C19_Aegina08_13,I watch.
E_C19_Aegina08_14,You take treasure chest.
E_C19_Aegina08_15,Huh? Why me!?
E_C19_Aegina08_16,You go get it.
E_C19_Aegina08_17,You stronger.
E_C19_Aegina08_18,Your hat and more place good hide.
E_C19_Aegina08_19,No time. Go do!
E_C19_Aegina08_20,"...Tsk, fine."
E_C19_Aegina08_21,"Let's see... Come on out, treasures!"
E_C19_Aegina08_22,Huh?
E_C19_Aegina08_23,Gwaaahh!
E_C19_Aegina08_24,...
E_C19_Aegina08_25,...Ack! Not me! All she!
E_C19_Aegina08_26,You traitor Goblin!
E_C19_Aegina09_01,Uuurgh...
E_C19_Aegina09_02,Do you understand now?
E_C19_Aegina09_03,You have to cooperate with us for your own safety.
E_C19_Aegina09_04,Yes... / Ok...
E_C19_Aegina09_05,We don't have time to lose. The center of the grave is just up ahead. 
E_C19_Aegina09_06,"If you make a mess in front of the grave of the God King as well,"
E_C19_Aegina09_07,we will not let it pass so easily.
E_C19_Aegina09_08,Understood?
E_C19_Aegina09_09,Yes... / Ok...
E_C19_Aegina09_10,"Ahaha, you're really scary at times like this, Zafir."
E_C19_Aegina09_11,"You're usually so quiet, but really strict when it comes to following orders."
E_C19_Aegina09_12,"You were always stubborn and a stickler, even when you were young."
E_C19_Aegina09_13,Always talking about living up to expectations and...
E_C19_Aegina09_14,"...That's enough storytelling, Laudia."
E_C19_Aegina09_15,Anyway... we're going to enter the God King's Palace soon. It's in the center of the graves.
E_C19_Aegina09_16,It looks like the Undeads are heading that way as well.
E_C19_Aegina09_17,"Everyone, make all the necessary preparations."
E_C19_Aegina10_01,This is the center of the grave.
E_C19_Aegina10_02,And it looks like... we're too late.
E_C19_Aegina10_03,...
E_C19_Aegina10_04,Gwaaah...
E_C19_Aegina10_05,"Hahaha, humans from Aegina?"
E_C19_Aegina10_06,"I applaud your efforts for coming here, but it's too late."
E_C19_Aegina10_07,"The ritual is almost over,"
E_C19_Aegina10_08,and your precious God King will join the Dark Legion soon.
E_C19_Aegina10_09,All shall follow Malduk's will...!
E_C19_Aegina10_10,...!!!
E_C19_Aegina10_11,You dare desecrate the graves of our ancestors and even the God King's body...!?
E_C19_Aegina10_12,Repent your sin with death!
E_C19_Aegina10_13,"Zafir, hold on. "
E_C19_Aegina10_14,"Ahahaha! Undead, go on and keep that brat busy!"
E_C19_Aegina10_15,I can't wait to see your face filled with despair.
E_C19_Aegina11_01,"Ugh, the God King's royal guards...!"
E_C19_Aegina11_02,"There are too many, Zafir!"
E_C19_Aegina11_03,Fall back for now!
E_C19_Aegina11_04,We can't do that!
E_C19_Aegina11_05,If we don't drive them out of here...
E_C19_Aegina11_06,I will never be able to look my at ancestors in the eye!
E_C19_Aegina11_07,I will never be... the successor of the God King!
E_C19_Aegina11_08,*Whew* You really are stubborn.
E_C19_Aegina11_09,Why are you always trying to take care of everything on your own?
E_C19_Aegina11_10,"Sometimes, you have to let others help you!"
E_C19_Aegina11_11,!!!
E_C19_Aegina11_12,"Now, guys!"
E_C19_Aegina11_13,"They're all clustered nice and close! Miruru Pirates, fire!"
E_C19_Aegina11_14,Kyaha! Chance for new weapon test!
E_C19_Aegina11_15,Ahahahaha! / Kyahahaha!
E_C19_Aegina12_01,"Ugh, there are rats in the pack as well."
E_C19_Aegina12_02,"You managed to destroy my Undead so easily. Impressive, especially since you didn't use any magic."
E_C19_Aegina12_03,But the ritual is over. It's time for... 
E_C19_Aegina12_04,Hyaa!
E_C19_Aegina12_05,!! When did you..
E_C19_Aegina12_06,"Now, Zafir!"
E_C19_Aegina12_07,Disappear!
E_C19_Aegina12_08,Tsk!!
E_C19_Aegina12_09,Useless! This little sand arrow won't... 
E_C19_Aegina12_10,"Silence, you fool."
E_C19_Aegina12_11,Kwaaak!!!
E_C19_Aegina12_12,What are these vulgar creatures doing at the King's Palace?
E_C19_Aegina12_13,The grave keepers should have been executed already.
E_C19_Aegina12_14,"However, I'm in a good mood today."
E_C19_Aegina12_15,I have awoken from a long slumber and have been resurrected.
E_C19_Aegina12_16,Now I can finally go meet her.
E_C19_Aegina12_17,Bwa ha ha ha!
E_C19_Aegina12_18,...!!!
E_C19_Aegina12_19,This energy...!
E_C19_Aegina12_20,It belongs to the living...!
E_C19_Aegina12_21,This is... impossible!
E_C19_Aegina12_22,Lord Malduk's ritual should have been perfect!
E_C19_Aegina12_23,Why does an Undead have free will!? 
E_C19_Aegina12_24,"I told you to keep quiet, fool."
E_C19_Aegina12_25,Do not make me repeat myself.
E_C19_Aegina12_26,How can the living become an Undead?
E_C19_Aegina12_27,I am the great God King of the Desert.
E_C19_Aegina12_28,"As long as this land, this desert exists... "
E_C19_Aegina12_29,I am immortal!
E_C19_Aegina12_30,That's... impossible!
E_C19_Aegina12_31,"Hmph, I'm getting tired of this conversation."
E_C19_Aegina12_32,You there.
E_C19_Aegina12_33,You must be children of the desert. Speak your name.
E_C19_Aegina12_34,My name is Laudia of the Trovatia tribe.
E_C19_Aegina12_35,"It is an honor to meet you, God King."
E_C19_Aegina12_36,...I am Zafir of the Mauhata tribe.
E_C19_Aegina12_37,"It is an honor to meet you, God King."
E_C19_Aegina12_38,Hm. The tribes that serve the God Dragon.
E_C19_Aegina12_39,And you... Oh? That black cat of yours is of noble blood.
E_C19_Aegina12_40,Looks like you and I are of the same bloodline.
E_C19_Aegina12_41,"...I am humbled, Your Majesty."
E_C19_Aegina12_42,...Hmph.
E_C19_Aegina12_43,"Then, I will entrust you the first task as my descendant."
E_C19_Aegina12_44,Dispose of that trash over there.
E_C19_Aegina12_45,...As you command.
E_C19_Aegina13_01,"Gwaaah, Lord Malduk..."
E_C19_Aegina13_02,I apologize...
E_C19_Aegina13_03,"Hmph, I don't know who this Malduk is,"
E_C19_Aegina13_04,"but since he controls such pitiful Undead, he must be useless trash."
E_C19_Aegina13_05,...And what are those little rats that are trying to sneak away?
E_C19_Aegina13_06,Grave robbers? Execute them.
E_C19_Aegina13_07,Heeeeek! / Kyaaa!
E_C19_Aegina13_08,"Your Majesty, those two came here after realizing that the grave is in danger."
E_C19_Aegina13_09,We would have never made it here through the countless Undead on our own.
E_C19_Aegina13_10,"But with the help of those two, we were able to come here in time."
E_C19_Aegina13_11,"O-ho, I see."
E_C19_Aegina13_12,"Th-that's right! Ahem, it's all thanks to us!"
E_C19_Aegina13_13,"Kyaha! Firepower so good, see!?"
E_C19_Aegina13_14,...
E_C19_Aegina13_15,...
E_C19_Aegina13_16,Kuhuhu... Wahahaha!
E_C19_Aegina13_17,You have brought along some fine jesters.
E_C19_Aegina13_18,"Yes, clowns who know how to amuse others deserve a reward."
E_C19_Aegina13_19,Take this! A reward for your efforts!
E_C19_Aegina13_20,!!!!
E_C19_Aegina13_21,"Hahaha... Now, here comes the next task."
E_C19_Aegina13_22,Zafir and Laudia... right?
E_C19_Aegina13_23,Take me to Laias.
E_C19_Aegina13_24,It has been centuries since she and I have seen each other.
E_C19_Aegina13_25,I am sure she longs to see me again as well.
E_C19_Aegina13_26,I must go see her immediately.
E_C19_Aegina13_27,As you command.
E_C19_Aegina13_28,(...He's going to meet with Laias?
E_C19_Aegina13_29,I can already imagine Lilia and Neraxis's faces when they meet the God King...)
E_C19_Aegina13_30,"(Ahaha... Can't be helped, I guess.)"
E_S2_Main_1_1,"Phew, all done!"
E_S2_Main_1_2,"Organized my belongings, got changed... Now I'm going to take my well-earned break!"
E_S2_Main_1_3,"Wish Esker was here too... Maybe next time I guess, hehe."
E_S2_Main_1_4,"Hmm? Wait, this voice..."
E_S2_Main_1_5,La la la~ La la la la!
E_S2_Main_1_6,"Oh, hello Shea!"
E_S2_Main_1_7,Ophelia! How have you been?
E_S2_Main_1_8,"It's been a while since Mr. Schute has been this excited,"
E_S2_Main_1_9,so I ended up dancing along all the way over here!
E_S2_Main_1_10,"Nice! Since you're here, why don't you come watch our show?"
E_S2_Main_1_11,A show?
E_S2_Main_1_12,Yep! Stardust will be performing a special show to celebrate the coming of summer!
E_S2_Main_1_13,"We're preparing a cool and fascinating show that uses ice and water, with the ocean as our background."
E_S2_Main_1_14,So we're asking our audience to wear swimsuits since they may get splashed.
E_S2_Main_1_15,That's the reason why the tickets are cheaper than usual!
E_S2_Main_1_16,"Aha, so that's why you're wearing a swimsuit."
E_S2_Main_1_17,Yep! Correct!
E_S2_Main_1_18,"Do you have a swimsuit, Shea? If you do, please come watch the show!"
E_S2_Main_1_19,We always prepare something special for the summer show. You won't regret it!
E_S2_Main_1_20,That sounds amazing! I won't miss it then! I happen to have a swimsuit with me too.
E_S2_Main_1_21,"Are you excited too, Mr. Schute? It seems we're both excited then, hee hee!"
E_S2_Main_1_22,Ophelia!
E_S2_Main_1_23,Hmm? What is it?
E_S2_Main_1_24,"You don't happen to have the show tickets, do you? Or have you seen anyone who took the tickets?"
E_S2_Main_1_25,"No, I stored all the tickets in the box. I didn't see anyone take them either."
E_S2_Main_1_26,Did something happen..?
E_S2_Main_1_27,"Ugh, the tickets, th-they're gone! Not just one, but five bundles!"
E_S2_Main_1_28,No way...!
E_S2_Main_1_29,This wouldn't have happened if Esker was here...
E_S2_Main_1_30,Agreed. He was in charge of selling tickets after all...
E_S2_Main_1_31,But he isn't here with us now... Hmm...
E_S2_Main_1_32,"So, I was wondering if you could find those tickets for us?"
E_S2_Main_1_33,Huh? Me?
E_S2_Main_1_34,We only have a week until the show starts. We have to find them before then.
E_S2_Main_1_35,And think about the loss if those tickets fall into the hands of scalpers!
E_S2_Main_1_36,Please? I know you can find them in no time!
E_S2_Main_1_37,"Um, I'm not so sure about that, but..."
E_S2_Main_1_38,Ok! I will retrieve those tickets!
E_S2_Main_1_39,"In that case, can I join you?"
E_S2_Main_1_40,Huh? You want to join me?
E_S2_Main_1_41,Yep. Mr. Schute wants to come along.
E_S2_Main_1_42,It sounds kinda fun! Please let us tag along!
E_S2_Main_1_43,Thanks so much!
E_S2_Main_1_44,No worries! I'll do my best to find those tickets with Shea!
E_S2_Main_1_45,"Thanks, Ophelia! We're counting on you!"
E_S2_Main_1_46,"Now then, let's start looking, shall we?"
E_S2_Main_1_47,Let's go find the missing tickets!
E_S2_Main_1_48,...But first!
E_S2_Main_1_49,Hmm?
E_S2_Main_1_50,"As this is also a part of the show, you should get changed!"
E_S2_Main_1_51,A part of the show! I like the sound of that!
E_S2_Main_1_52,I'll go get changed right now!
E_S2_Main_2_1,Will your cards really find the tickets for us?
E_S2_Main_2_2,"I think so! Thankfully, the cards are responding."
E_S2_Main_2_3,Let's see... They should be nearby...
E_S2_Main_2_4,I think I found them! There!
E_S2_Main_2_5,"Wow! You're amazing, Ophelia!"
E_S2_Main_2_6,"Hehe, aww thanks! Come on, let's go!"
E_S2_Main_2_7,The plan is working out much smoother than we had expected.
E_S2_Main_2_8,We should be able to reach the empire safely at this rate.
E_S2_Main_2_9,T-that's good to hear... Yes...
E_S2_Main_2_10,Is something bothering you?
E_S2_Main_2_11,I-isn't this a covert operation? Why are we wearing swimsuits?
E_S2_Main_2_12,The answer is in your question. That's because it IS a covert operation.
E_S2_Main_2_13,"According to our intel, a performance troupe called 'Stardust' will be holding a special show near this area."
E_S2_Main_2_14,"The show's theme is water and ice, so the dress code is swimsuit."
E_S2_Main_2_15,So that's the reason why there are so many civilians wearing swimsuits...
E_S2_Main_2_16,Correct.
E_S2_Main_2_17,So you understand now why we are wearing swimsuits. We need to blend in as naturally as we can.
E_S2_Main_2_18,What a strategy... You truly are the best inquisitor in the empire. My respect to you.
E_S2_Main_2_19,I am just doing my best to accomplish this mission.
E_S2_Main_2_20,"I know these outfits are revealing and uncomfortable, but please endure it for just a bit longer."
E_S2_Main_2_21,You need not worry about me. I will strive to not fall behind you.
E_S2_Main_2_22,"Hmm? What's wrong, Mr. Schute? Huh?"
E_S2_Main_2_23,There's something inside that luggage?
E_S2_Main_2_24,Awesome! We came to the right place!
E_S2_Main_2_25,The people guarding that luggage look scary though...
E_S2_Main_2_26,But I have to do this for the tickets! Here goes nothing!
E_S2_Main_2_27,Um... Excuse me.
E_S2_Main_2_28,Is there something you need?
E_S2_Main_2_29,Actually... I think some of our belongings went inside your luggage.
E_S2_Main_2_30,Mind if we take a look inside?
E_S2_Main_2_31,Nonsense.
E_S2_Main_2_32,We have been guarding it the entire time. There's no way some foreign objects found their way inside.
E_S2_Main_2_33,"Mr. Schute, are our things really not inside that luggage?"
E_S2_Main_2_34,"Um.... He said no, our things are inside it."
E_S2_Main_2_35,"...I do not know who you are talking to, but we cannot allow you to see our luggage."
E_S2_Main_2_36,We are telling the truth. Please take our word and move away from the luggage. If not...
E_S2_Main_2_37,We have no choice but to defend it from you.
E_S2_Main_2_38,What should we do...?
E_S2_Main_2_39,The tickets are definitely inside... I'm sure of it.
E_S2_Main_2_40,Right? Even my tarot cards are telling me so...
E_S2_Main_2_41,That was your last warning. Now we will identify you as a threat to our operation. Proceeding to neutralize the hostiles!
E_S2_Main_2_42,I shall support!
E_S2_Main_2_43,"Oh no, how did it come to this?!"
E_S2_Main_3_1,Ugh... They are both formidable foes. We should give our all!
E_S2_Main_3_2,They refuse to yield even when we used our powers to that extent...
E_S2_Main_3_3,Does that mean they realized that we are on a covert mission?
E_S2_Main_3_4,Then we can't let ourselves be defeated! Prepare yourselves!
E_S2_Main_3_5,Ahh... What should we do?
E_S2_Main_3_6,"Um, so Mr. Schute has been telling me that he thinks there is another item inside that luggage other than the show tickets."
E_S2_Main_3_7,It must be something super important then. What should we do?
E_S2_Main_3_8,Why is Esker not here when I need him?!
E_S2_Main_3_9,"Ophelia, look! That's...!"
E_S2_Main_3_10,I saw it too!
E_S2_Main_3_11,The tickets! They really are in there!
E_S2_Main_3_12,"We can't give up now... I'm sorry, guys!"
E_S2_Main_3_13,They're coming!
E_S2_Main_3_14,Deploying defense for- ugh!
E_S2_Main_3_15,What's happening?! My weapon has been disabled!
E_S2_Main_4_1,To lose like this...
E_S2_Main_4_2,"This is our complete defeat. Maddening, but we have to admit it..."
E_S2_Main_4_3,Yay! Found 'em!
E_S2_Main_4_4,So the tickets were in here after all.
E_S2_Main_4_5,Strange. We checked it several times before moving out.
E_S2_Main_4_6,I have no idea how these items ended up in our luggage.
E_S2_Main_4_7,...Strange indeed.
E_S2_Main_4_8,"Nonetheless, you were right. We apologize for the misunderstanding."
E_S2_Main_4_9,"Although we have no clue as to how these items found their way in,"
E_S2_Main_4_10,your belongings were indeed found in our luggage.
E_S2_Main_4_11,"Tee hee, that's alright. We should be the ones to apologize."
E_S2_Main_4_12,"Also, it was actually pretty fun! It was an enjoyable experience!"
E_S2_Main_4_13,Then can we make a request? Please do not tell anyone about what you saw in the luggage.
E_S2_Main_4_14,We would prefer to keep things quiet... We would appreciate your cooperation.
E_S2_Main_4_15,"Of course! We are the ones who got you involved, after all."
E_S2_Main_4_16,"Also if you don't mind, I would like to give you these show tickets as a token of apology."
E_S2_Main_4_17,The show starts after a week! Please come and see it!
E_S2_Main_4_18,We will see you at the show then!
E_S2_Main_4_19,Wait...!
E_S2_Main_4_20,*Sigh*
E_S2_Main_4_21,So. Why did the weapon not work properly?
E_S2_Main_4_22,This weapon is the pinnacle of the Empire's technomagic technology... There shouldn't be any problems..
E_S2_Main_4_23,I find that odd as well- oh?
E_S2_Main_4_24,Hmm?
E_S2_Main_4_25,It's been a while! Although we said goodbye only just yesterday.
E_S2_Main_4_26,What's with all the long faces?
E_S2_Main_4_27,...
E_S2_Main_4_28,"Nothing, sir. What brings you here, Sir Fluss?"
E_S2_Main_4_29,I thought your mission was to oversee the shipment from Penteonia.
E_S2_Main_4_30,"Haha. That mission was successfully concluded, thanks to you both."
E_S2_Main_4_31,"Because the mission is now complete, you are to both go on a vacation. This is His Majesty's order."
E_S2_Main_4_32,"Pardon, sir?!"
E_S2_Main_4_33,We have not yet delivered our luggage.
E_S2_Main_4_34,Haha...
E_S2_Main_4_35,They say one must trick even his own allies if it helps to achieve victory.
E_S2_Main_4_36,The item you were delivering is fake.
E_S2_Main_4_37,The real item is already in the safe hands of the Empire.
E_S2_Main_4_38,....
E_S2_Main_4_39,"....If I understood correctly, you ordered us to deliver a counterfeit item?"
E_S2_Main_4_40,"Who would dare to guess that you, the elites of the Empire, would carry a fake?"
E_S2_Main_4_41,"No one. That's why I ordered you to do so, huhuhu."
E_S2_Main_4_42,...I am not sure if I should be happy about it.
E_S2_Main_4_43,But why are you wearing a swimsuit?
E_S2_Main_4_44,"Haha, now that's another easy question to answer."
E_S2_Main_4_45,To watch Stardust's show of course! A performance of water! Aren't you excited to see it?
E_S2_Main_4_46,We... did receive the show tickets as a gift...
E_S2_Main_4_47,Is that so? Good!
E_S2_Main_4_48,"Why don't we just leave all of this behind us and enjoy the moment? We are on a vacation, after all."
E_S2_Main_4_49,....
E_S2_Main_5_1,Hooray! Finally!
E_S2_Main_5_2,Stardust's special show to celebrate summer... I'm really looking forward to it!
E_S2_Main_5_3,"Right?! Seeing that they make us wear swimsuits, I feel like this show is going to be wild!"
E_S2_Main_5_4,I can't wait to see it! I just hope there will be lots of hot guys as well!
E_S2_Main_5_5,Ha... hahaha...
E_S2_Main_5_6,Hmm... That ticket is not the one we lost.
E_S2_Main_5_7,I think so too. Mr. Schute says it's not the one.
E_S2_Main_5_8,"I have to say though, those tarot cards of yours are really something, Ophelia. It's amazing to see that you don't need help from Mr. Schute to find the tickets."
E_S2_Main_5_9,"Hehe, they really are something, aren't they? I guess the power of my cards is still imbued within the tickets."
E_S2_Main_5_10,That's why my cards twinkle when they find a ticket.
E_S2_Main_5_11,Twinkling like now?
E_S2_Main_5_12,"Yes, twinkle twinkle..."
E_S2_Main_5_13,.....
E_S2_Main_5_14,Oh!!! The tickets must be nearby!
E_S2_Main_5_15,Yay! Let's go now!
E_S2_Main_6_1,"End of the line, Erze."
E_S2_Main_6_2,"Huh, I knew we'd meet again at some point,"
E_S2_Main_6_3,"but this is not a good time. I don't feel like playing with you now, sis."
E_S2_Main_6_4,"Since Stardust's show is approaching, won't you just buzz off?"
E_S2_Main_6_5,That show is the very reason why I chased you down.
E_S2_Main_6_6,Did you think I didn't know about your plan to drain blood from the audience while they're caught up with the show?
E_S2_Main_6_7,Hmph.
E_S2_Main_6_8,Trying to deceive a vampire hunter...
E_S2_Main_6_9,"Have the passing years killed off your wits, Erze?"
E_S2_Main_6_10,"Your insulting skills have clearly improved over the passing years, sister. Hehe..."
E_S2_Main_6_11,"Well, I was planning to settle the score with you at some point anyway."
E_S2_Main_6_12,This is actually a good opportunity... Hehehe.
E_S2_Main_6_13,"Then let me dine on your blood, sis! With the same blood that runs through our family's veins... Hehehe!"
E_S2_Main_6_14,...Erze... So you have completely succumbed to your desire for more blood.
E_S2_Main_6_15,It hurts having to cut my dear sister down...
E_S2_Main_6_16,But I would rather cut you down here myself than see you die by others!
E_S2_Main_6_17,"Hahaha!!! Yes, now that's my sister!"
E_S2_Main_6_18,"I will give you a quick, painless death. Your blood is mine~!"
E_S2_Main_6_19,.....
E_S2_Main_6_20,.....
E_S2_Main_6_21,Are you done?
E_S2_Main_6_22,"Um... Haha... If you don't mind, I would like to take back the red-haired lady's ticket."
E_S2_Main_6_23,What?
E_S2_Main_6_24,That ticket... It's the thing we lost.
E_S2_Main_6_25,Could you give it back to us?
E_S2_Main_6_26,"Erze, don't tell me you've been stealing things!"
E_S2_Main_6_27,Have I taught you this way?
E_S2_Main_6_28,"No! As a vampire hun- I mean, as a vampire, I have my pride!! I would never steal!"
E_S2_Main_6_29,"I found it on the ground and picked it up, that's all!"
E_S2_Main_6_30,Which means.. It belongs to me! I won't give this back to you. Over my dead body!
E_S2_Main_6_31,Unless each of you is willing to let me bite your neck.
E_S2_Main_6_32,"Wow, that vampire lady must be really strong!"
E_S2_Main_6_33,"Mr. Schute just told me that if we allow her to drain our blood, we will be nothing but bones and skins."
E_S2_Main_6_34,That's terrifying!!
E_S2_Main_6_35,I guess we really have to fight her and take the ticket by force this time!!
E_S2_Main_6_36,Two against one? How cheap!
E_S2_Main_6_37,You will have to go through me first before you cut down my sister!
E_S2_Main_6_38,"Awww, how sweet of you, sister."
E_S2_Main_6_39,"To show my gratitude, I will suck your blood last."
E_S2_Main_6_40,Shut it! T-this is the only time I'm going to help you!
E_S2_Main_7_1,"Kyahaha! I see that your skills haven't rusted, sister!"
E_S2_Main_7_2,"Those girls, the more I look at them, the prettier they look!"
E_S2_Main_7_3,I'm sure their blood is healthy and tasty too... Ahhh... I can't wait to place my fangs upon their neck...
E_S2_Main_7_4,Kyah!
E_S2_Main_7_5,W-what are you doing?! I thought you were on my side just for this once!
E_S2_Main_7_6,Your vampiric ramblings made my body respond accordingly.
E_S2_Main_7_7,That's not fair!
E_S2_Main_7_8,H-huh? What is this?
E_S2_Main_7_9,Erze?
E_S2_Main_7_10,I... don't feel like fighting anymore...
E_S2_Main_7_11,I bet their blood taste real bad... Don't you think?
E_S2_Main_7_12,W-what's wrong with you?
E_S2_Main_7_13,"Oh, looks like our lady in red is feeling down..."
E_S2_Main_7_14,Time to play something to cheer her up! Lalala...
E_S2_Main_7_15,"Oooh, that song sounds wonderful!"
E_S2_Main_7_16,"Wanna dance like old times, Seria?"
E_S2_Main_7_17,W-what are you saying? This is no time for nonsense!
E_S2_Main_7_18,"Shea, come on! You shouldn't boost the enemy's morale!"
E_S2_Main_7_19,I have no choice but to do this! Haa!
E_S2_Main_8_1,Ughh...
E_S2_Main_8_2,"My plan to feast upon the fresh, tasty blood of the show audience is now ruined!!"
E_S2_Main_8_3,"Phew, glad to see that you are back to normal..."
E_S2_Main_8_4,"Hang on, what am I saying..?!"
E_S2_Main_8_5,"Hehe... Sorry, but I can't let you have a whole bundle for free..."
E_S2_Main_8_6,"But, I can give you each a ticket! Take it as a token of my apology."
E_S2_Main_8_7,What?
E_S2_Main_8_8,Did you not hear her just now? She is planning to drain the blood of the audience!
E_S2_Main_8_9,Tee hee~
E_S2_Main_8_10,Erze!!
E_S2_Main_8_11,"Since you gave me this present, I will let you go this time. If you see me again, then you better hope you're prepared, m'kay?"
E_S2_Main_8_12,"Now, I'm excited to see the show with you, sis! I can't wait! Hehehe!"
E_S2_Main_8_13,Stop right there!!
E_S2_Main_8_14,Ugh...
E_S2_Main_8_15,You are going to regret this one day!
E_S2_Main_8_16,What a friendly pair of siblings.
E_S2_Main_8_17,"Hm? Do you have something to say, Mr. Schute?"
E_S2_Main_8_18,You're wondering if it would be okay to invite a vampire who plans to suck the blood of the audience to the show?
E_S2_Main_8_19,Of course it is! Anyone is welcome to our shows.
E_S2_Main_8_20,We've had Demons and Angels come to watch our shows in the past!
E_S2_Main_8_21,That's amazing!
E_S2_Main_8_22,"Besides, we always make preparations that our shows are completely safe!"
E_S2_Main_8_23,"Now then, let's go and find the other tickets, shall we? Let's go!"
E_S2_Main_9_1,"Oh, hello! It's a mighty fine morning, don't you think?"
E_S2_Main_9_2,"It's still early in the morning, and yet you're all up and out. Good for you!"
E_S2_Main_9_3,"I don't know what you’re looking for,"
E_S2_Main_9_4,but it's always good to have something to focus on! Huhuhu!
E_S2_Main_9_5,Hmm...
E_S2_Main_9_6,"Is something bothering you, Ophelia?"
E_S2_Main_9_7,Actually...
E_S2_Main_9_8,The tickets we've gathered so far... I think they are a bit weird.
E_S2_Main_9_9,That blond-haired lady and the red vampire lady from before...
E_S2_Main_9_10,They seemed to be somehow influenced by these tickets.
E_S2_Main_9_11,"Thinking about it, Mr. Schute did tell me that he felt a peculiar energy."
E_S2_Main_9_12,He doesn't think that the tickets are doing harm though. Isn't that okay then?
E_S2_Main_9_13,Hmm... I guess... I don't know.
E_S2_Main_9_14,.....
E_S2_Main_9_15,.....
E_S2_Main_9_16,Ahhh!!
E_S2_Main_9_17,"Where did you get that from, kitty?!"
E_S2_Main_9_18,Meow?
E_S2_Main_9_19,"Oh, our little cat friend ran away..."
E_S2_Main_9_20,Nooo! Let's chase after it!!
E_S2_Main_9_21,Amazing! You've made something amazing again.
E_S2_Main_9_22,"You really are handy, Zafir."
E_S2_Main_9_23,Is that so? It could've been better though. This one didn't feel right.
E_S2_Main_9_24,"Oh, how come?"
E_S2_Main_9_25,.....
E_S2_Main_9_26,Still can't get the incident at the grave of the God King off your mind?
E_S2_Main_9_27,"I'm sure Lady Laias will take good care of it, don't you worry."
E_S2_Main_9_28,"That's why you were sent all the way out here on vacation, so that you can relax peacefully."
E_S2_Main_9_30,That's right. Thank you for your kind words.
E_S2_Main_9_31,"Tee hee, don't mention it."
E_S2_Main_9_32,"Ah, Hoabis, how was your walk?"
E_S2_Main_9_33,Hoabis seems to like this place. She's been going out a lot.
E_S2_Main_9_34,"Huff, huff... We've finally caught up!"
E_S2_Main_9_35,Found it! There it is!
E_S2_Main_9_36,"Hello, may I speak to that cat for a bit?"
E_S2_Main_9_37,That cat took what's ours... We need it back!
E_S2_Main_9_38,I don't know what you are talking about.
E_S2_Main_9_39,Hoabis is not a cat that would steal an item that belongs to others!
E_S2_Main_9_40,He's right. There must be some kind of misunderstanding.
E_S2_Main_9_41,"But I just saw her carrying the tickets with her mouth. Right, Mr. Schute?"
E_S2_Main_9_42,Meoooow...
E_S2_Main_9_43,Hoabis is innocent. Can't you see it from those eyes?
E_S2_Main_9_44,"Ugh...I-I admit those are really cute, innocent, and pretty eyes...."
E_S2_Main_9_45,but we really need to get those tickets back!
E_S2_Main_9_46,So be it then.
E_S2_Main_9_47,"Hoabis is our precious, hallowed companion. We will prove her innocence!"
E_S2_Main_9_48,"Oh, then I guess I'll be singing to Miss Kitty this time! I'll do my best!"
E_S2_Main_9_49,"That's not the point here... Ugh, how did it come to this again?"
E_S2_Main_10_1,Meow?
E_S2_Main_10_2,"Ugh, no Hoabis!!"
E_S2_Main_10_3,Meow! Meow meow!
E_S2_Main_10_4,W-we can't fight if Hoabis is like that...!!
E_S2_Main_10_5,No! The kitty will get hurt if this goes on!
E_S2_Main_10_6,Haaa!!!
E_S2_Main_10_7,Hoabis!!
E_S2_Main_10_8,"It's all good now, Zafir. Hoabis will be safe there."
E_S2_Main_10_9,"Way to go, Ophelia! That was so cool!"
E_S2_Main_10_10,But I won't let you take all the spotlight!
E_S2_Main_11_1,I see.. You two were telling the truth...
E_S2_Main_11_2,Forgive me for disrespecting you.
E_S2_Main_11_3,I would like to apologize as well.
E_S2_Main_11_4,I get anxious whenever Hoabis is involved...
E_S2_Main_11_5,"Hehe, that's alright."
E_S2_Main_11_6,I wouldn't have believed it either if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
E_S2_Main_11_7,Cats are the most precious things in the world after all!!
E_S2_Main_11_8,Ophelia! I found a ticket!
E_S2_Main_11_9,"Thanks, Shea, now let's see... Huh?"
E_S2_Main_11_10,Was that the only one? There should be 12 in total.
E_S2_Main_11_11,"Yep, I only found one. Mr. Schute said that's all the tickets here."
E_S2_Main_11_12,No way...
E_S2_Main_11_13,Wish we could help you somehow...
E_S2_Main_11_14,"Oh, our little miss cat is going somewhere!"
E_S2_Main_11_15,That direction leads to the inn we are staying at...
E_S2_Main_11_16,Hm... Let us follow her for now.
E_S2_Main_11_17,"Welcome! Oh, so many guests..."
E_S2_Main_11_18,Your cat is very cute by the way. She brought all the tickets here. She must like them a lot.
E_S2_Main_11_19,So that's what happened...
E_S2_Main_11_20,"Haha, it's good that we found the tickets."
E_S2_Main_11_21,But I feel sorry for our little kitty. We have to take them all back.
E_S2_Main_11_22,The items must be returned to the owner. That's how it should be.
E_S2_Main_11_23,We apologize for causing such trouble.
E_S2_Main_11_24,"No no, it's all good. It was an enjoyable experience to play a song for our little miss cat."
E_S2_Main_11_25,"I had fun too. It must be fate that led us all here! Please, take these tickets!"
E_S2_Main_11_26,One for our little kitty as well. Be sure to come and watch the show!
E_S2_Main_11_27,"Oh, how kind of you."
E_S2_Main_11_28,I wish I could show my gratitude other than with words... Thank you for your kindness.
E_S2_Main_11_29,Hey! Isn't it a show ticket for Stardust's summer show?
E_S2_Main_11_30,"Can I get one too, pleeease?"
E_S2_Main_11_31,I've been wanting to watch it! I actually bought a swimsuit recently!
E_S2_Main_11_32,"Hmm, what should I do..."
E_S2_Main_11_33,Meooow.
E_S2_Main_11_34,"Our little miss cat is saying that she would love to see you give Lady Juno her ticket, tee hee."
E_S2_Main_11_35,"Aww, thank you, kitty cat!"
E_S2_Main_11_36,"Hehe, all is good, and everyone's happy. What a lovely day!"
E_S2_Main_11_37,Meoow~!
E_S2_Main_12_1,I'm so glad that I managed to get it without much trouble. The ticket for Stardust's special show...
E_S2_Main_12_2,It was much more expensive than I had thought but I'm glad I had a lot saved up.
E_S2_Main_12_3,Now I should take this to the mistress. I'm sure she will love it.
E_S2_Main_12_4,.....
E_S2_Main_12_5,Umm.
E_S2_Main_12_6,Is there something you want from me?
E_S2_Main_12_7,"....We, want to go to the show too..."
E_S2_Main_12_8,We've never been to a show before... We don't know what it's like...
E_S2_Main_12_9,Me too! I would love to see Stardust show!
E_S2_Main_12_10,But... The tickets are too expensive... and selling the artifacts is not an option...
E_S2_Main_12_11,I see. It saddens me to hear that.
E_S2_Main_12_12,"Fortunately, I bought extra tickets just in case. I will give each of you a ticket."
E_S2_Main_12_13,Are you serious?! Yess!
E_S2_Main_12_14,Thank you so much!! Please come by the tower in the future. I will be sure to pay you back!
E_S2_Main_12_15,...One ticket...
E_S2_Main_12_16,There are a lot of us... Would one be enough...?
E_S2_Main_12_17,"Many? I don't know what you are saying,"
E_S2_Main_12_18,but one should be enough. Don't worry.
E_S2_Main_12_19,...So kind...
E_S2_Main_12_20,"....Yes, thank you..."
E_S2_Main_12_21,"Hmm, this is weird..."
E_S2_Main_12_22,Why are the tickets scattered?
E_S2_Main_12_23,"Strange indeed. So far, all the tickets we came across were gathered in one spot..."
E_S2_Main_12_24,"Oh, I think I know! Someone must be handing out the tickets to attract more people to watch the show!"
E_S2_Main_12_25,"Haha, normally, I would have complimented that person, but those tickets were stolen from us..."
E_S2_Main_12_26,We should get them back before they get even more scattered!
E_S2_Main_12_27,"Hmm? What is it, Mr. Schute?"
E_S2_Main_12_28,Oh... You hear some people talking about Stardust nearby?
E_S2_Main_12_29,"Thank you, Mr. Schute!"
E_S2_Main_12_30,"Lead the way, Shea!"
E_S2_Main_12_31,"Oh wow, this ticket is interesting..."
E_S2_Main_12_32,A special magic seems to be imbued in it!
E_S2_Main_12_33,Yes...
E_S2_Main_12_34,I feel good the more I see it...
E_S2_Main_12_35,Really? Hmm...
E_S2_Main_12_36,"Well, it is a Stardust show ticket, after all. Doesn't surprise me. "
E_S2_Main_12_37,Wait! Stop for a moment!
E_S2_Main_12_38,Huh?
E_S2_Main_12_39,Phew... Finally found you...
E_S2_Main_12_40,"Sorry for saying this out of the blue, but those show tickets are the tickets our Stardust staff members have lost."
E_S2_Main_12_41,Mind giving those back to us?
E_S2_Main_12_42,What? I bought them with my money...
E_S2_Main_12_43,Hang on... So that's why it felt expensive...
E_S2_Main_12_44,(That seller... Was it a scalper?!)
E_S2_Main_12_45,Aw... Just when I thought I was finally going to watch the first show performance ever...
E_S2_Main_12_46,We... have to give this back...?
E_S2_Main_12_47,...No...
E_S2_Main_12_48,"W-wait... Ophelia, something's not right...!"
E_S2_Main_12_49,T-that's...!
E_S2_Main_12_50,We want to watch the show...! We must go to the show...!!
E_S2_Main_12_51,W-what is this...?
E_S2_Main_12_52,Ahhhh!
E_S2_Main_12_53,Help! The elementals are not listening to my command!
E_S2_Main_12_54,Wahhhh! What's going on here?!
E_S2_Main_12_55,The tickets... They are ours... We need to watch... the show..!!
E_S2_Main_12_56,Oh no... Maybe this is a phenomenon that occurs in those who carry the fake tickets.
E_S2_Main_12_57,Which means the problem should be solved if we retrieve the tickets from them.
E_S2_Main_12_58,Looks like we don't have much choice then. I'll help!
E_S2_Main_13_1,Haaaa!!
E_S2_Main_13_2,This is troublesome... I can't hurt the young children.
E_S2_Main_13_3,In that case...!
E_S2_Main_13_4,"Ma'am, can you cover us for a bit?"
E_S2_Main_13_5,Shea and I will try to retrieve the tickets from them while they are busy.
E_S2_Main_13_6,Come on kids! Listen to me!
E_S2_Main_13_7,...I think that elf lady needs more urgent saving than the young lady.
E_S2_Main_13_8,I'll hold on for as long as I can. I'll leave the rest to you!
E_S2_Main_14_1,Phew! That was really hard.
E_S2_Main_14_2,Ugh... This headache is killing me..
E_S2_Main_14_3,Did you all calm down now? Good...
E_S2_Main_14_4,Looks like this lady has fallen unconscious.
E_S2_Main_14_5,So cute... I think she's having a good dream.
E_S2_Main_14_6,Would it be alright to leave her like that though? She had it quite rough for some time...
E_S2_Main_14_7,Worry not. I will keep watch over her.
E_S2_Main_14_8,To think that the tickets I bought caused a ruckus..
E_S2_Main_14_9,I truly apologize for everything.
E_S2_Main_14_10,"No, no! It's all good!"
E_S2_Main_14_11,"You helped us retrieve the tickets, hehe."
E_S2_Main_14_12,"Um, but where could that seller have gotten those tickets from?"
E_S2_Main_14_13,"Yes, yes. Right? Mr. Schute says he's curious as well."
E_S2_Main_14_14,I'm curious as well! He even enchanted the tickets with some evil magic to make people suffer!
E_S2_Main_14_15,I'm gonna track him down and teach him a lesson!
E_S2_Main_14_16,"Oh, the tickets are flying away!"
E_S2_Main_14_17,That evil scalper! It must be another one of his tricks!
E_S2_Main_14_18,How dare he commit such an atrocity to my dear elementals! I will never forgive him!
E_S2_Main_14_19,"I wish I could follow, but I don't think I can."
E_S2_Main_14_20,I leave this to your hands. Please put an end to this so that no further victims appear.
E_S2_Main_14_21,"Yes, leave it to me!"
E_S2_Main_14_22,"Oh, I almost forgot!"
E_S2_Main_14_23,This is a token of gratitude for helping us out! Please give this to Lavril too.
E_S2_Main_14_24,"Hehe, I will see you on the day of the show!"
E_S2_Main_14_25,What a kind young girl...
E_S2_Main_14_26,I'm glad this ended well.
E_S2_Main_14_27,Priscilla!!
E_S2_Main_14_28,Mistress? What brings you-
E_S2_Main_14_29,Who is this girl? Why are you cuddling her like that?
E_S2_Main_14_30,Priscilla's embrace is mine and mine alone...!!
E_S2_Main_14_31,"Let me explain... Mistress, please calm down first!"
E_S2_Main_14_32,"Greetings, could you spare a moment? I have a question to ask..."
E_S2_Main_14_33,Huh?
E_S2_Main_14_34,"Wait, you are..."
E_S2_Main_15_1,"Huff, huff... I'm exhausted...!"
E_S2_Main_15_2,"Ugh, I am so out of shape.. I've been stationed at the tower for too long!"
E_S2_Main_15_3,"Are you alright, elf lady?"
E_S2_Main_15_4,T-this is nothi... Noth- I'm sorry...
E_S2_Main_15_5,Hmm? Mr. Schute? What's wrong?
E_S2_Main_15_6,That guy. See what he's doing.
E_S2_Main_15_7,"Come on brothers, an opportunity like this doesn't come every day!"
E_S2_Main_15_8,This is THE Stardust's special summer show we are talking about!
E_S2_Main_15_9,"This is a once in a lifetime event that even has a dress code! Come on, you don't wanna miss out on something like this! What do you say?"
E_S2_Main_15_10,"Well... I admit I want to show this to Lei, I mean, Lewisia."
E_S2_Main_15_11,She loves hanging out and chatting with people. I'm sure she would want to go.
E_S2_Main_15_12,The price though... It's a bit... steep.
E_S2_Main_15_13,"Agreed. I know it's a special show, but even considering that, it's way too expensive."
E_S2_Main_15_14,"Besides, I haven't even met up with my siblings. Something like this is usele-"
E_S2_Main_15_15,"Oh, come on! You have no idea!"
E_S2_Main_15_16,"Lua herself said this: Value comes from materials. Therefore, an expensive material is of high value."
E_S2_Main_15_17,"Hey, you, barbarian friend!"
E_S2_Main_15_18,Just think about how happy she would be if you give this ticket to her!
E_S2_Main_15_19,Who knows? She might get so happy that she will propose to you!
E_S2_Main_15_20,"No, no, Lei and I are already a family."
E_S2_Main_15_21,"H-huh? O-okay, sure! Still!"
E_S2_Main_15_22,She will be so happy if you give her a present!
E_S2_Main_15_23,"And you there, middle-aged guy with a scar!"
E_S2_Main_15_24,M-middle-aged?
E_S2_Main_15_25,Can't see your siblings? Then just buy it and send it to them!
E_S2_Main_15_26,Think about it! They'll come running immediately to see you!
E_S2_Main_15_27,That won't be possible. They're in the Empire.
E_S2_Main_15_28,"Gosh, how frustrating..."
E_S2_Main_15_29,"There you are, you evil scalper!!"
E_S2_Main_15_30,"As if stealing wasn't enough, you are actually selling the tickets to others? Unacceptable! Give those tickets back!"
E_S2_Main_15_31,What?
E_S2_Main_15_32,"Come on, I ain't a thief! I may hustle, but I don't steal!"
E_S2_Main_15_33,I'm selling the tickets I picked up! What I'm doing is legitimate!
E_S2_Main_15_34,Huh? What's going on here?
E_S2_Main_15_35,"Hmm... From what I've gathered, he's a scalper, and he tried to rip us off..."
E_S2_Main_15_36,Kehahaha! Humans are truly amusing creatures!
E_S2_Main_15_37,Hmm!?
E_S2_Main_15_38,Ugh!!
E_S2_Main_15_39,"Hmm? Mr. Schute, are you alright?"
E_S2_Main_15_40,"H-his sword... It's dangerous. Although we are of the same kind, we're also different."
E_S2_Main_15_41,Oh? Then that means...
E_S2_Main_15_42,"You've found your family, yay! Congratulations, Mr. Schute!"
E_S2_Main_15_43,That's not it! Were you listening to me when I said he's dangerous?!
E_S2_Main_15_44,Legitimate? Yeah right! We went through so much trouble because of you!
E_S2_Main_15_45,"Although I'm not as powerful as Selene, I too, am a royal Elven princess!"
E_S2_Main_15_46,I will not let you get away with this injustice!
E_S2_Main_15_47,"Oh, is that right? You want a piece of me, huh?"
E_S2_Main_15_48,"You're in luck, folks! If you can defeat those brats, I'll give you a 50% discount on these tickets!"
E_S2_Main_15_49,"What? That's quite tempt- wait, what am I saying?!"
E_S2_Main_15_50,I refuse to get involved in this. I don't want to get into unnecessary trouble.
E_S2_Main_15_51,"But I DO! Plus, there's a really interesting kid over there!"
E_S2_Main_15_52,Kehaha! I'm going to fight!! I'm gonna go full-on crazy!!
E_S2_Main_15_53,*Sigh*... Why do I always end up in a situation like this?
E_S2_Main_15_54,"Alright, let's go bros!"
E_S2_Main_15_55,W-what? I'm in too?!
E_S2_Main_15_56,"Ugh, I don't even know what's going on but whatever!"
E_S2_Main_15_57,"Aw, looks like your family is coming to see you. That's so cool!"
E_S2_Main_15_58,"I got your back! I will right wrongs and triumph over evil, and that means youuu!"
E_S2_Main_15_59,Give us back the tickets you stole!!
E_S2_Main_16_1,Kehahaha! This is it! This is perfect!!
E_S2_Main_16_2,It's been ages since I've been this fired up!! This is it!!
E_S2_Main_16_3,"Huff, huff... Keep your mouth shut! I can't focus on the battle!"
E_S2_Main_16_4,"Not even you can stop me this time, Bernheim!!"
E_S2_Main_16_5,I can feel it... I'm feeling it!!
E_S2_Main_16_6,This is!!
E_S2_Main_16_7,DESTINY!!
E_S2_Main_16_8,DESTINNNNY?!
E_S2_Main_16_9,Could it be that Mr. Schute finally found himself a lover...?!
E_S2_Main_16_10,No no no no! That's not what's important here!
E_S2_Main_16_11,"Right you are, elf!"
E_S2_Main_16_12,"I don't want to share my destiny with you!! Come on, let's go, Shea!"
E_S2_Main_17_1,That was... a strangely draining fight. Even more so than usual...
E_S2_Main_17_2,Huff... Huff... same...
E_S2_Main_17_3,Huff... Huff... It was harder than that time when my elementals went out of control...
E_S2_Main_17_4,Yeah... It feels like I got mentally attacked.
E_S2_Main_17_5,"Mr. Schute, that music was very passionate today!"
E_S2_Main_17_6,Are you shy because you got proposed?
E_S2_Main_17_7,Absolutely not!!
E_S2_Main_17_8,Dammit... I just wanted to earn some extra cash... How did it come to this?
E_S2_Main_17_9,That doesn't mean I'm going to give up that easily!
E_S2_Main_17_10,"Hey bros, think about my offer again! I'll sell it to ya cheaper than the original price! What do you say?"
E_S2_Main_17_11,This is an opportunity like never befor-
E_S2_Main_17_12,Argh!
E_S2_Main_17_13,"Well well, I was wondering where you were..."
E_S2_Main_17_14,"So this is where you were, Brother Baudouin."
E_S2_Main_17_15,Lucias!!
E_S2_Main_17_16,"Selling illegal tickets... Have you gone out of your mind? I had my suspicion when I heard the description of the seller's appearance, but..."
E_S2_Main_17_17,"It seems you need more of Goddess Lua's words, brother."
E_S2_Main_17_18,And this is how I will engrave her words into your heart. 
E_S2_Main_17_19,H-hold on! There are other people here!
E_S2_Main_17_20,"Correct, but I stand in front of a man who tainted the honor and name of the Church of Lua..."
E_S2_Main_17_21,I'm sure they'll understand there needs to be discipline towards such outrageous behavior!
E_S2_Main_17_22,Ack!!
E_S2_Main_17_23,I apologize on behalf of Brother Baudouin. He has caused much trouble...
E_S2_Main_17_24,How should I proceed to compensate for this? Please do tell.
E_S2_Main_17_25,T-that's not necessary! We just need to retrieve the tickets!
E_S2_Main_17_26,"Hehe, don't you recognize me, Lucias? It's me, Ophelia!"
E_S2_Main_17_27,You used to come watch our show all the time!
E_S2_Main_17_28,"Ahh, Ophelia... I got so worked up and didn't recognize you. "
E_S2_Main_17_29,Ahem... I'm sorry you had to see that...
E_S2_Main_17_30,"Hehe, I'm just glad it all ended well! We caught the scalper!"
E_S2_Main_17_31,Now we can all go and enjoy the show-
E_S2_Main_17_32,Dosarta!!
E_S2_Main_17_33,Oh my words! Selene!
E_S2_Main_17_34,You...! Do you know how long I've waited? Don't tell me you forgot our promise again!
E_S2_Main_17_35,(Oh no!! I was supposed to play with Selene on the beach...!)
E_S2_Main_17_36,Uh... S-sorry Selene..!!
E_S2_Main_17_37,But you are so scary when you are angry!! I'm sorrryy!!
E_S2_Main_17_38,Where are you going?! Stop right there! Dosarta!!
E_S2_Main_17_39,"It's still somehow chaotic, but everything's good and well... Isn't it?"
E_S2_Main_17_40,I think so... Hehe.
E_S2_Main_17_41,"Oh, right!"
E_S2_Main_17_42,"Here, take this!"
E_S2_Main_17_43,This is... a Stardust show ticket?
E_S2_Main_17_44,Are you sure you can just give away something like this?
E_S2_Main_17_45,Yeah! It's a token of apology for involving you into this mess.
E_S2_Main_17_46,Also... a token of friendship too! Hehe.
E_S2_Main_17_47,"You have to come and watch the show, alright? It's a promise!"
E_S2_Main_17_48,I don't know how to thank you enough... This will make Lei really happy.
E_S2_Main_17_49,...I thank you as well.
E_S2_Main_17_50,My soul is telling me that this is destiny! I knew it!
E_S2_Main_17_51,"What is thy name, o' instrument of soul-capturing melody?!"
E_S2_Main_17_52,I have no reason...
E_S2_Main_17_53,to tell you that!!
E_S2_Main_18_1,"...Three, four, five...! That's it! We now have all the lost bundles!"
E_S2_Main_18_2,These tickets though... They're really weird. They move on their own and they fly around... Just like my cards.
E_S2_Main_18_3,This never happened before. What's going on?
E_S2_Main_18_4,Huh? Glitters..?
E_S2_Main_18_5,T-this is...!!
E_S2_Main_18_6,This place is...
E_S2_Main_18_7,Stardust's performing theatre? Why are we here?
E_S2_Main_18_8,That voice... Ophelia?
E_S2_Main_18_9,...I-I can't believe it!!
E_S2_Main_18_10,Esker!!
E_S2_Main_18_11,"Haha, I really didn't expect to see you here."
E_S2_Main_18_12,Me too! This is so cool!
E_S2_Main_18_13,"Oh, this is Shea, by the way!"
E_S2_Main_18_14,"Hello, it's nice to meet you."
E_S2_Main_18_15,"Aha, what an adorable friend you've made."
E_S2_Main_18_16,"Since I haven't seen you for such a long time, I really wish we could just sit down and have a catch-up..."
E_S2_Main_18_17,"but as you can see, I'm bound to this place and cannot get out."
E_S2_Main_18_18,So you've been stuck here all along?
E_S2_Main_18_19,"Pretty much. I actually feel like I've been here for only a short time, though."
E_S2_Main_18_20,Perhaps my dice are the reason behind this.
E_S2_Main_18_21,Huh? That means... could this show ticket also be...?
E_S2_Main_18_22,The show ticket?
E_S2_Main_18_23,I get it... So it's connected to the power of my dice.
E_S2_Main_18_24,"Being the owner of these dice, I'm not surprised that I was dragged in here,"
E_S2_Main_18_25,but it seems you've been invited here because of these tickets.
E_S2_Main_18_26,So the cause of all this is-
E_S2_Main_18_27,"Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you from the bottom of my heart."
E_S2_Main_18_28,"You've all been such a lovely audience, and to repay all the encouragement and love you've shown me..."
E_S2_Main_18_29,I have prepared a very special show just for today.
E_S2_Main_18_30,"I, Hexipolia, will give my all to present to you, a perfect show."
E_S2_Main_18_31,Hexipolia?! Why is it taking your appearance?!
E_S2_Main_18_32,Maybe because I'm the current owner of the dice.
E_S2_Main_18_33,This is quite unpleasant though... I feel like my appearance has been stolen from me.
E_S2_Main_18_34,Looks like we have to take that thing down to get out of here.
E_S2_Main_18_35,"I could use a good stretch. What do you say, Ophelia?"
E_S2_Main_18_36,Of course! I will help you retrieve your stolen appearance!
E_S2_Main_18_37,So this is the last performance! Let's do our best!
E_S2_Main_19_1,"Ohhh, such beautiful light... Dazzling, brilliant light..."
E_S2_Main_19_2,That was the best show ever. I'm satisfied with it myself.
E_S2_Main_19_3,I... don't have to perform anymore today... Thank you all... for coming...
E_S2_Main_19_4,"Yay! The show is over! That was an excellent performance, Mr. Schute!"
E_S2_Main_19_5,Whew... I didn't expect it to be this tough.
E_S2_Main_19_5_1,"It went away for now, but we can't let our guards down yet."
E_S2_Main_19_5_2,It might try something funny with the tickets again. You never know.
E_S2_Main_19_5_3,"Hehe, but I don't think he will cause any more trouble for a while."
E_S2_Main_19_5_4,Because it looked to me that Mr. Hexipolia was satisfied with his show!
E_S2_Main_19_5_5,Mr. Schute says he agrees with you!
E_S2_Main_19_5_6,"But, just in case, he says we should retrieve all the fake tickets."
E_S2_Main_19_5_7,"I don't know who you are talking to, but I agree. Better safe than sorry."
E_S2_Main_19_6,Yeah! And it would be nice to see you in action more!
E_S2_Main_19_7,"Oh, will you be joining us this show? I'm sure the others will be excited to have you!"
E_S2_Main_19_8,Hmm... I'm afraid I still have some business to take care of. Perhaps another time.
E_S2_Main_19_9,I'm glad you're doing well though. I've been worried.
E_S2_Main_19_10,Hmph! Weren't you the one that always pulled jokes on me?
E_S2_Main_19_11,"Haha, you got me. Can’t fool you, can I?"
E_S2_Main_19_11_1,"I'd love to spend some time with you, dear Ophelia,"
E_S2_Main_19_12,but I should get going now.
E_S2_Main_19_12_1,Let us catch up another time.
E_S2_Main_19_13,Oh wait! Esker!
E_S2_Main_19_14,...He left...
E_S2_Main_19_15,"Aw geez, I haven't seen him in forever!"
E_S2_Main_19_15_1,"I'm glad he looks healthy though, hehe."
E_S2_Main_19_16,And Shea! Thanks so much!
E_S2_Main_19_16_1,I couldn't have done this without your help.
E_S2_Main_19_17,"I should thank you too, Ophelia. It was such a fun experience!"
E_S2_Main_19_18,So the show finally starts tomorrow... I hope everyone enjoys the show.
E_S2_Main_19_19,They will! I hope we see everyone we invited tomorrow!
E_S2_Main_19_20,Are you sad that the show for the day has ended so soon?
E_S2_Main_19_21,Please don't be. You do not need to worry or get saddened.
E_S2_Main_19_22,"If you wish to stay longer and watch the show go on,"
E_S2_Main_19_23,"no matter how exhausting or tiring it may be, no matter how many times I wish for it to all end,"
E_S2_Main_19_24,this clown will continue to perform for you.
E_H2_Main_1_1_1,P-please don't go.
E_H2_Main_1_1_2,Where is everyone going?
E_H2_Main_1_1_3,*Sob sob*... Why are they leaving us?
E_H2_Main_1_1_4,I’m scared...
E_H2_Main_1_1_5,Please don't leave us...
E_H2_Main_1_1_6,Come back... I’m scared...
E_H2_Main_1_1_7,"My my, a child of darkness? I’ve never seen you before."
E_H2_Main_1_1_8,It’s dangerous for such tiny darkness to wander around unattended.
E_H2_Main_1_1_9,What are you doing here alone?
E_H2_Main_1_1_10,Wow! Didn't realize that Halloween is such a big thing here too!
E_H2_Main_1_1_11,Everyone is dressed up as ghosts.
E_H2_Main_1_1_12,Welcome! Welcome!
E_H2_Main_1_1_13,Is there anyone brave enough to try the mysterious haunted mansion?
E_H2_Main_1_1_14,This is a special event that will make your Halloween even spookier!
E_H2_Main_1_1_15,"Hmm, what should I do? Maybe I can... Ah, forget it..."
E_H2_Main_1_1_16,Forget what?
E_H2_Main_1_1_17,"The haunted mansion. I mean, I was looking for a horror-themed event for research, "
E_H2_Main_1_1_18,but it looks too scary to go alo- 
E_H2_Main_1_1_19,Yikes! W-who are you?!
E_H2_Main_1_1_20,Me? I’m Cecilia!
E_H2_Main_1_1_21,I-I’m Leo...
E_H2_Main_1_1_22,Nice to meet you Leo!
E_H2_Main_1_1_23,"You know, that haunted house interests me as well."
E_H2_Main_1_1_24,"If you are worried about going in alone, then why don't we go in together?"
E_H2_Main_1_1_25,"Huh?! T-thanks, but I'm good…"
E_H2_Main_1_1_26,If you could just come back and tell me how it was-
E_H2_Main_1_1_27,Let's go then!
E_H2_Main_1_1_28,N-no! Didn't you hear what I just said?!
E_H2_Main_1_1_29,"Yay, two customers! Welcome!"
E_H2_Main_1_1_30,Allow me to give you a brief introduction!
E_H2_Main_1_1_31,This mansion belonged to a noble who was known for his extreme wealth.
E_H2_Main_1_1_32,"After the sudden death of his wife, the nobleman was driven mad, and he started performing a strange experiment."
E_H2_Main_1_1_33,Then there were these ridiculous rumors of encountering disfigured monsters roaming around the mansion.
E_H2_Main_1_1_34,Or even rumors of sensing ominous gaze...
E_H2_Main_1_1_35,"Not only that, the workers in the mansion started disappearing one by one!"
E_H2_Main_1_1_36,"(Wow, what a typical horror-themed intro.)"
E_H2_Main_1_1_37,(I don’t think I can use that for my novel.)
E_H2_Main_1_1_38,"In this spooky adventure, your goals are to: Uncover the mystery of the mansion,"
E_H2_Main_1_1_39,and the disappearance of the mansion workers who used to work in there!
E_H2_Main_1_1_40,"Oh, and there are already other adventurers inside. If you run into them, you can team up and enjoy the adventure together."
E_H2_Main_1_1_41,"Wow, what an interesting story!"
E_H2_Main_1_1_42,"Let’s go in, Leo!"
E_H2_Main_2_1_1,"After concluding my wife's funeral, I came across an old tome in my study."
E_H2_Main_2_1_2,"Upon skimming through its contents, I have learned that this tome contains\nthe knowledge of the power of darkness as well as the light."
E_H2_Main_2_1_3,"I do not know whence this tome found its way into my study,"
E_H2_Main_2_1_4,but I know for certain that my research into this tome will eventually\nbring my wife back to life.
E_H2_Main_2_1_5,"The Goddess took my wife away from me,"
E_H2_Main_2_1_6,but I will bring her back.
E_H2_Main_2_1_7,It already looked quite spooky outside..
E_H2_Main_2_1_8,but it’s so much spookier on the inside.
E_H2_Main_2_1_9,"I know, right! The atmosphere is stronger inside."
E_H2_Main_2_1_10,"This place is so big and wide, yet there’s no light. It also feels silent and empty."
E_H2_Main_2_1_11,They say the size of one’s house is the size of one’s wealth...
E_H2_Main_2_1_12,What should we do now? We didn't exactly have a plan when we entered.
E_H2_Main_2_1_13,Not sure. Isn’t a place like this usually armed with a jump-scare gimmick?
E_H2_Main_2_1_14,"Like, a ghost might pop up if we go near that door!"
E_H2_Main_2_1_15,T-that’s no good!
E_H2_Main_2_1_16,I can't use that for reference! I would like to avoid that as much as possible!
E_H2_Main_2_1_17,*Thud*
E_H2_Main_2_1_18,Eek!!!
E_H2_Main_2_1_19,What the!
E_H2_Main_2_1_20,"Oh, just the door shutting... Whew..."
E_H2_Main_2_1_21,Huh? The door won't open.
E_H2_Main_2_1_22,"What?! T-then, are we locked up in here?"
E_H2_Main_2_1_23,Maybe this is intentional. So that they can scare us.
E_H2_Main_2_1_24,They might have left a way to communicate with a staff member somewhere.
E_H2_Main_2_1_25,I’m not seeing anything like that here!
E_H2_Main_2_1_26,"Calm down, Leo!"
E_H2_Main_2_1_27,This is just an event. You don’t have to be too scared.
E_H2_Main_2_1_28,I’m sure we will find a way out if we explore enough!
E_H2_Main_2_1_29,"You are so positive, Cecilia..."
E_H2_Main_2_1_30,Kyaaaa!
E_H2_Main_2_1_31,Wasn’t that someone screaming?
E_H2_Main_2_1_32,M-maybe that’s another gimmick.
E_H2_Main_2_1_33,Let’s go to the direction where that sound came from!
E_H2_Main_2_1_34,"W-wait up, Cecilia!"
E_H2_Main_2_1_35,Don't leave me behind!
E_H2_Main_2_2_1,The scream was coming from here!
E_H2_Main_2_2_2,"C’mon, Leo! Why are you so slow?"
E_H2_Main_2_2_3,Hurry!
E_H2_Main_2_2_4,*Pant*... *Pant*...
E_H2_Main_2_2_5,"You are way too quick, Cecilia!"
E_H2_Main_2_2_6,Kyaaaa!!
E_H2_Main_2_2_7,Looks like this mansion’s huge size isn't all good!
E_H2_Main_2_2_8,Hey!! Are you okay!?
E_H2_Main_2_2_9,...
E_H2_Main_2_2_10,Hmm?
E_H2_Main_2_2_11,Is there something wrong?
E_H2_Main_2_2_12,"I, uh... Didn't you hear someone screaming over here?"
E_H2_Main_2_2_13,I thought it was yours...
E_H2_Main_2_2_14,A scream?
E_H2_Main_2_2_15,"No, I didn't scream... nor did I hear anyone screaming."
E_H2_Main_2_2_16,Huh... Strange...
E_H2_Main_2_2_17,"N-nothing scary here, right?"
E_H2_Main_2_2_18,"Yeah! By the way, that doll looks similar to the ones we saw on the way here."
E_H2_Main_2_2_19,"Oh, now that you say that... It does resemble the dolls we’ve seen before."
E_H2_Main_2_2_20,Is that your doll?
E_H2_Main_2_2_21,"Yes, I found it lying around, so I decided to pick it up and keep it! It’s cute!"
E_H2_Main_2_2_22,Um... Cecilia? Don't you think she’s a bit strange?
E_H2_Main_2_2_23,Hmm? What’s strange?
E_H2_Main_2_2_24,"Like, she told us that she hasn't heard the scream before..."
E_H2_Main_2_2_25,"Not only that, those dolls that have been attacking us"
E_H2_Main_2_2_26,immediately calmed down the moment she hugged them...
E_H2_Main_2_2_27,"If anything, it actually looks as if the dolls are trying to run away from her."
E_H2_Main_2_2_28,Maybe they are just friends.
E_H2_Main_2_2_29,That’s not how horror-themed stories play out!
E_H2_Main_2_2_30,"If this was a mystery novel, she would be a primary suspect!"
E_H2_Main_2_2_31,Are you accusing me?
E_H2_Main_2_2_32,I’m innocent!
E_H2_Main_2_2_33,Whoa... How did she hear that?
E_H2_Main_2_2_34,Do not underestimate the hearing of an Elf!
E_H2_Main_2_2_35,I can even hear you whispering!
E_H2_Main_2_2_36,Maybe I didn't hear anything because I'm slow! But that doesn't mean you should doubt me!
E_H2_Main_2_2_37,You two are so mean!
E_H2_Main_2_3_1,Waaah!
E_H2_Main_2_3_2,"It's one thing to be a suspect, but-"
E_H2_Main_2_3_3,We were too harsh...
E_H2_Main_2_3_4,I'm so sorry for misjudging you...
E_H2_Main_2_3_5,Yeah... Sorry for doubting you.
E_H2_Main_2_3_6,I think we were too immersed in this spooky mansion atmosphere.
E_H2_Main_2_3_7,"Oh yeah, we haven’t even told you our names yet."
E_H2_Main_2_3_8,I’m Cecilia! And this is Leo!
E_H2_Main_2_3_9,*Sob*... I’m Dosarta...
E_H2_Main_2_3_10,"Nice to meet you, Dosarta."
E_H2_Main_2_3_11,"We didn't start off too good, but let’s explore this mansion together."
E_H2_Main_2_3_12,Okay! Let’s combine our strengths and solve this mansion’s mystery!
E_H2_Main_2_3_13,"Come to think of it, this was my first time fighting against an Elf!"
E_H2_Main_2_3_14,"I noticed it at the festival plaza as well,"
E_H2_Main_2_3_15,but interracial interactions are really lively here in Orvel.
E_H2_Main_2_3_16,"I like how different races are living together in harmony, like it's no big deal."
E_H2_Main_2_3_17,I wish the Empire was like that too.
E_H2_Main_2_3_18,"Oh, are you from the Empire, Cecilia?!"
E_H2_Main_2_3_19,Yeah. Didn't I tell you that?
E_H2_Main_2_3_20,You didn’t!
E_H2_Main_2_3_21,"If you had told me this sooner, I could've listened to you talk about the Empire"
E_H2_Main_2_3_22,instead of entering here! That would've been more productive!
E_H2_Main_2_3_23,Haha! You can hear that after we exit this mansion!
E_H2_Main_2_3_24,"Well... Since the Emperor wishes to see different races come together and live in harmony,"
E_H2_Main_2_3_25,"the Empire on the surface, looks quite accommodating."
E_H2_Main_2_3_26,"But... the moment you step out of the capital, racial discrimination and oppression are pretty common."
E_H2_Main_2_3_27,Ah! I think my sister told me about the Elves of the Empire.
E_H2_Main_2_3_28,"Ah, do you mean the Shadow Forest Elves?"
E_H2_Main_2_3_29,"The Elves there, they... are not on good terms with other races."
E_H2_Main_2_3_30,They don’t like coming out of their forest to begin with.
E_H2_Main_2_3_31,They're also quite hostile towards visitors.
E_H2_Main_2_3_32,Sis said something like that as well.
E_H2_Main_2_3_33,"She said they weren't that unfriendly before, but then again, she did say that area was frequently invaded by humans."
E_H2_Main_2_3_34,"Yeah, I heard that the Shadow Forest was frequently invaded by the Empire."
E_H2_Main_2_3_35,"But around the time I was born, the Emperor had lost interest in the Shadow Forest."
E_H2_Main_2_3_36,I don't know the exact reason though.
E_H2_Main_2_3_37,Perhaps they came to realization that fighting was meaningless?
E_H2_Main_2_3_38,I actually heard that the Empire is troubled with the Resistance.
E_H2_Main_2_3_39,"Wow, so the Resistance is not being well-received in Orvel as well?"
E_H2_Main_2_3_40,W-well that's what the book from the Empire said...
E_H2_Main_2_3_41,The Resistance are good people fighting for justice.
E_H2_Main_2_3_42,"Obviously, it'd be best if everyone could just all get along well without having to fight,"
E_H2_Main_2_3_43,But silence won't solve anything in the Empire right now.
E_H2_Main_2_3_44,The Resistance knows that. That’s why they decided to muster up the courage to keep fighting.
E_H2_Main_2_3_45,"If... a member of the Resistance heard that, they would've really appreciated it."
E_H2_Main_2_3_46,D-do ya think so? Hahaha!
E_H2_Main_2_3_47,(Did I sound too serious?!)
E_H2_Main_2_3_48,(What if they find out that I’m actually from the Resistance?!)
E_H2_Main_2_3_49,I don't get to hear about the Empire that often.
E_H2_Main_2_3_50,"That’s why your stories are very interesting to me, Cecilia!"
E_H2_Main_2_3_51,Please tell me more!
E_H2_Main_2_3_52,I will!
E_H2_Main_2_3_53,I heard the door opening from that side. Let’s talk while we head over there!
E_H2_Main_2_3_54,Sounds good! Let’s go!
E_H2_Main_3_1_1,The records of the tome fascinated me to no end.
E_H2_Main_3_1_2,What are these sorceries that are capable of shaking the very root of this world?
E_H2_Main_3_1_3,"If the contents of the tome are indeed true,"
E_H2_Main_3_1_4,"not only can I resurrect my wife, but I can also be free from the unjust rules\nof the Goddess."
E_H2_Main_3_1_5,"With this tome, I could obtain the very power to create my own rules."
E_H2_Main_3_1_6,It was as if my beloved was giving me another chance.
E_H2_Main_3_1_7,"A chance to become the new master of the world, and make my own\ngarden of paradise."
E_H2_Main_3_1_8,Hmm...
E_H2_Main_3_1_9,And that's it. The team that just left should be enough.
E_H2_Main_3_1_10,Now it's up to you.
E_H2_Main_3_1_11,The hunt has already begun. It’s going quite smoothly.
E_H2_Main_3_1_12,"Really? That case, wouldn't it have been better to take that child with you?"
E_H2_Main_3_1_13,"I know you love and care for that child,"
E_H2_Main_3_1_14,but you can't just spoon-feed the child forever.
E_H2_Main_3_1_15,We are not apart.
E_H2_Main_3_1_16,We are originally one-we are just staying apart for now.
E_H2_Main_3_1_17,"If we can do it on our own, that means that the other one can do it as well."
E_H2_Main_3_1_18,I’m just advising you to utilize this opportunity to the fullest.
E_H2_Main_3_1_19,Don't you think the hunt would be even more enjoyable if the both of you work together?
E_H2_Main_3_1_20,The 'other' does not hunt.
E_H2_Main_3_1_21,We are the ones who hunt.
E_H2_Main_3_1_22,"My my, how stubborn. *Chuckle*"
E_H2_Main_3_1_23,"If that's what you want, then so be it."
E_H2_Main_3_1_24,"I just need to make sure you're able to take your own steps, that’s all."
E_H2_Main_3_2_1,*BANG!* *BANG BANG!*
E_H2_Main_3_2_2,..?? I’m hearing gunshots beyond this door.
E_H2_Main_3_2_3,Gunshots?
E_H2_Main_3_2_4,In a haunted house?
E_H2_Main_3_2_5,I-isn't that vandalism?!
E_H2_Main_3_2_6,Let’s open the door a bit and check!
E_H2_Main_3_2_7,Just a little bit!
E_H2_Main_3_2_8,"I’m hearing strange sounds now, not gunshots..."
E_H2_Main_3_2_9,I’m gonna open it just a little bit.
E_H2_Main_3_2_10,O-okay! We are all hidden now!
E_H2_Main_3_2_11,...
E_H2_Main_3_2_12,Kyaaaaaaahhh!
E_H2_Main_3_2_13,Whoaaa. That startled me there.
E_H2_Main_3_2_14,"Guys, this is just a do-"
E_H2_Main_3_2_15,Who are you?
E_H2_Main_3_2_16,Agh!
E_H2_Main_3_2_17,"I-I guess you were not a doll, haha..."
E_H2_Main_3_2_18,Doll? You mean this?
E_H2_Main_3_2_19,"Hang on, that’s the same doll that Dosarta carries around!"
E_H2_Main_3_2_20,It’s as if everyone’s got that doll except for us.
E_H2_Main_3_2_21,True... Dosarta’s doll...
E_H2_Main_3_2_22,"Oh, that doll! It’s cute, isn’t it?"
E_H2_Main_3_2_23,"Eh... Uh... How should I address you, sir?"
E_H2_Main_3_2_24,Sir? You don’t need to be so formal. Just call me Mitra.
E_H2_Main_3_2_25,"So uh, Mitra..."
E_H2_Main_3_2_26,Where did you... pick up that doll?
E_H2_Main_3_2_27,"Huh? Nah, I-"
E_H2_Main_3_2_28,...
E_H2_Main_3_2_29,Never mind. Let’s just say I picked it up.
E_H2_Main_3_2_30,(Just picked it up..? What does he mean by that..?)
E_H2_Main_3_2_31,"If you want this doll, just wait until it's your turn."
E_H2_Main_3_2_32,It will just appear to you.
E_H2_Main_3_2_33,Our turn?
E_H2_Main_3_2_34,Is this something like an event prize then?
E_H2_Main_3_2_35,They didn't tell us that at the entrance...
E_H2_Main_3_2_36,Perhaps that’s a clue to finding the secret of this mansion? Like how it is in a mystery novel...
E_H2_Main_3_2_37,That might be the case!
E_H2_Main_3_2_38,"Hey old mister, can you show me your doll?"
E_H2_Main_3_2_39,Old mister?! Old misterrrr?! 
E_H2_Main_3_2_40,Di-did you just address me as something an old man would hear?
E_H2_Main_3_2_41,Let’s see if you can still call me an old mister after I unload these bullets!!
E_H2_Main_3_2_42,Eek! He looks angry!
E_H2_Main_3_2_43,What's wrong with calling an older looking guy an old mister?
E_H2_Main_3_3_1,Stop shooting like that! It’s dangerous!
E_H2_Main_3_3_2,I could not care any less!
E_H2_Main_3_3_3,"But kid, you're pretty quick, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_3_3_4,"And you are really strong, old mister!"
E_H2_Main_3_3_5,"Huh? Hey, that rabbit! It’s running away!"
E_H2_Main_3_3_6,What!?
E_H2_Main_3_3_7,You little!!
E_H2_Main_3_3_8,Justice Kick!
E_H2_Main_3_3_9,"Damn, you just run away the moment I look elsewhere."
E_H2_Main_3_3_10,You better stay still. Understood?
E_H2_Main_3_3_11,(Hmm? I think I just saw someone.)
E_H2_Main_3_3_12,(Mitra? What was that?)
E_H2_Main_3_3_13,(Was it just my imagination?)
E_H2_Main_3_3_14,Cecilia! Look!!
E_H2_Main_3_3_15,Hmm? What is it?
E_H2_Main_3_3_16,I found some strange objects.
E_H2_Main_3_3_17,"Well, I saw these tools from the book..."
E_H2_Main_3_3_18,I think they are tools used for dark magic.
E_H2_Main_3_3_19,Also... I can feel something more sinister.
E_H2_Main_3_3_20,"Do you know much about dark magic, Leo?"
E_H2_Main_3_3_21,"No, not exactly."
E_H2_Main_3_3_22,"If it's dark magic, could it be related to a Demon?"
E_H2_Main_3_3_23,Aren't the Demons causing quite a stir throughout the continent these days?
E_H2_Main_3_3_24,Well... I did hear that Demons have the same property as darkness...
E_H2_Main_3_3_25,But... What I’m feeling here seems a bit different.
E_H2_Main_3_3_26,Really? I’m not feeling anything here. Maybe it’s because I don't know much about that area.
E_H2_Main_3_3_27,"How about you, mister and Dosarta?"
E_H2_Main_3_3_28,"Nah, not feeling it."
E_H2_Main_3_3_29,Same here.
E_H2_Main_3_3_30,?
E_H2_Main_3_3_31,Hmmmmm...
E_H2_Main_3_3_32,I don’t think there’s anything important here. How about we get moving?
E_H2_Main_3_3_33,There are stairs that lead to the next floor beyond this door!
E_H2_Main_3_3_34,I want to explore the second floor too!
E_H2_Main_3_3_35,"We don’t know what kind of danger awaits us there, so let’s stick together!"
E_H2_Main_3_3_36,"Hey old mister, wanna come with us?"
E_H2_Main_3_3_37,"Eh, why not."
E_H2_Main_3_3_38,You can have this book. I can't figure out anything from reading it.
E_H2_Main_3_3_39,...Okay...
E_H2_Main_4_1_1,"I was off to a good start, but challenges came along as I progressed."
E_H2_Main_4_1_2,"Is it because I’m running low on supply of experimental subjects, or is it because\nmy wisdom has reached its limit?"
E_H2_Main_4_1_3,"The further I read the tome, the harder it was to decipher."
E_H2_Main_4_1_4,Days passed by with nothing to show.
E_H2_Main_4_1_5,I cannot delay it any further.
E_H2_Main_4_1_6,I have a feeling that the workers are slowly discovering my experiment.
E_H2_Main_4_1_7,I need more power of darkness.
E_H2_Main_4_1_8,Perhaps it's because this area is blessed by the light and sacred energy...
E_H2_Main_4_1_9,There seems to be not enough darkness.
E_H2_Main_4_1_10,It seems that I need to seek ways to draw darkness from elsewhere.
E_H2_Main_4_1_11,"Um... Maybe I’m worrying too much, but..."
E_H2_Main_4_1_12,What is it that you are worried about?
E_H2_Main_4_1_13,This mansion just feels really strange...
E_H2_Main_4_1_14,Is it because of that dark energy we talked about before?
E_H2_Main_4_1_15,"...Yes. I mean, this is supposed to be just a horror experience event."
E_H2_Main_4_1_16,The fact that they placed an item that emits actual darkness...
E_H2_Main_4_1_17,"For me, that’s-"
E_H2_Main_4_1_18,Very suspicious. Right?
E_H2_Main_4_1_19,"Do you think it’s strange too, Cecilia?"
E_H2_Main_4_1_20,"Leo, If you think it's strange, I think your worries are right!"
E_H2_Main_4_1_21,"You should be more confident, Leo! Speak up!"
E_H2_Main_4_1_22,You are the only one who can feel dark energy among us!
E_H2_Main_4_1_23,A-actually...
E_H2_Main_4_1_24,There’s one more thing...
E_H2_Main_4_1_25,What is it?
E_H2_Main_4_1_26,I'm not hundred percent sure about this... And I don't even know if I should say this...
E_H2_Main_4_1_27,"It's okay! I trust you, Leo!"
E_H2_Main_4_1_28,"Um... It's just that, I’m concerned about Dosarta..."
E_H2_Main_4_1_29,Dosarta? How come?
E_H2_Main_4_1_30,"When I first met her,"
E_H2_Main_4_1_31,"Though faint, I clearly felt the energy of the wind elementals..."
E_H2_Main_4_1_32,But now...I can sense the energy of darkness growing stronger from her...
E_H2_Main_4_1_33,P-please don't misunderstand this. It’s not like I personally have something against Dosarta...
E_H2_Main_4_1_34,"No no, I totally get what you mean!"
E_H2_Main_4_1_35,You're telling me this because you are worried about her!
E_H2_Main_4_1_36,It must’ve been hard for you to say. Thank you for telling me!
E_H2_Main_4_1_37,Th-thank you... for trusting me...
E_H2_Main_4_1_38,I will keep my eyes on Dosarta.
E_H2_Main_4_1_39,Th-then I will try to decipher this book’s contents!
E_H2_Main_4_1_40,"Okay! I’m counting on you, Leo!"
E_H2_Main_4_2_1,Let's find the secret of the mansion!
E_H2_Main_4_2_2,"...Though it feels more like, let's get more and more lost..."
E_H2_Main_4_2_3,It’s all just empty rooms here and nothing else.
E_H2_Main_4_2_4,I'm starting to think that the staff ripped us off!
E_H2_Main_4_2_5,Are you saying we fell for a scam?
E_H2_Main_4_2_6,Maybe we’ve been kidnapped?!
E_H2_Main_4_2_7,I don't think anyone would try to kidnap people at broad daylight-
E_H2_Main_4_2_8,"Huh? Hey, there’s someone there."
E_H2_Main_4_2_9,"Wow, that's a huge fellow."
E_H2_Main_4_2_10,It’s a living armor!!
E_H2_Main_4_2_11,Now that’s something that fits the haunted mansion theme!
E_H2_Main_4_2_12,?
E_H2_Main_4_2_13,Oh good. I would like to ask for direc-
E_H2_Main_4_2_14,Kyaaaaa!!! The armor is walking towards us!!
E_H2_Main_4_2_15,"Dear sir living armor, please don't eat me! Elves taste really bad!!"
E_H2_Main_4_2_16,"Do-dosarta, look ahead..."
E_H2_Main_4_2_17,"I am a living person, not a suit of armor."
E_H2_Main_4_2_18,"...So you were here too, Mitra."
E_H2_Main_4_2_19,Huh?
E_H2_Main_4_2_20,"Uh, yeah. Hey there. (Dammit, I didn't expect them to know each other.)"
E_H2_Main_4_2_21,*Cackles*
E_H2_Main_4_2_22,No wonder people mistake you as a monster! That look with your face! Ha!
E_H2_Main_4_2_23,I told you it would make you less conspicuous if you dressed up like the other humans!
E_H2_Main_4_2_24,That’s what you get for ignoring the great Targarios' advice! Khaha!
E_H2_Main_4_2_25,Huh? Mister Bernheim?
E_H2_Main_4_2_26,?? Do you know me?
E_H2_Main_4_2_27,It’s me! Cecilia!
E_H2_Main_4_2_28,You often visited our parents’ shop to carry out your guard duty!
E_H2_Main_4_2_29,Protector of justice! Don't you remember me?
E_H2_Main_4_2_30,Ah.
E_H2_Main_4_2_31,...You are old enough to travel alone now?
E_H2_Main_4_2_32,Yeah! I’m 16 now!
E_H2_Main_4_2_33,I can travel long distances easily on my own!
E_H2_Main_4_2_34,Long distance seems like an understatement for this one.
E_H2_Main_4_2_35,I don't remember your parents as the type to allow this so easily.
E_H2_Main_4_2_36,Nope! Which is why I kinda-sorta ran away!
E_H2_Main_4_2_37,...
E_H2_Main_4_2_38,"Mitra, I know you are a daredevil who doesn’t know when to stop,"
E_H2_Main_4_2_39,but taking children somewhere this dangerous is just too much.
E_H2_Main_4_2_40,"Oh, is it? Sorry, I guess?"
E_H2_Main_4_2_41,But it ain't me who brought these kids. Just saying.
E_H2_Main_4_2_42,??
E_H2_Main_4_2_43,(I’ve never seen Mitra like that before.)
E_H2_Main_4_2_44,Well then... My apologies for the misunderstanding.
E_H2_Main_4_2_45,I-I-I think we are in trouble!
E_H2_Main_4_2_46,It is trouble indeed to run into a heavy nagger. This guy here is like an another version of the old man.
E_H2_Main_4_2_47,"No, it’s something serious!"
E_H2_Main_4_2_48,"Mitra, that book you gave me before..."
E_H2_Main_4_2_49,I’ve been deciphering it until now and the book turned out to be... a-a textbook of dark magic!
E_H2_Main_4_2_50,A to Z of dark magic! A step-by-step guide to the element!!!
E_H2_Main_4_2_51,"Moreover, the magic featured right here"
E_H2_Main_4_2_52,is about creating a living entity by drawing darkness from the surrounding area!
E_H2_Main_4_2_53,"Hey, hey, easy."
E_H2_Main_4_2_54,This place is just an entertainment venue for kids.
E_H2_Main_4_2_55,I think you are taking a prop too seriously.
E_H2_Main_4_2_56,"I don't know what you kids were told,"
E_H2_Main_4_2_57,but this is no place for kids.
E_H2_Main_4_2_58,I...think so too...
E_H2_Main_4_2_59,??
E_H2_Main_4_2_60,...
E_H2_Main_4_2_61,...
E_H2_Main_4_2_62,...
E_H2_Main_4_2_63,Kyaaaaaa!!!!
E_H2_Main_4_3_1,##@##$@#%$%$%^$#$$$#
E_H2_Main_4_3_2,Heeeeek!
E_H2_Main_4_3_3,Leo!
E_H2_Main_4_3_4,You damned monster!
E_H2_Main_4_3_5,Stay dead!
E_H2_Main_4_3_6,Kahahahaha! My turn now!
E_H2_Main_4_3_7,(This..happened just a while ago...)
E_H2_Main_4_3_8,Targarios!
E_H2_Main_4_3_9,This thing right here! 
E_H2_Main_4_3_10,"It’s been preserved for a long time, but both the material and processing skills are of bad quality."
E_H2_Main_4_3_11,*Nom nom*
E_H2_Main_4_3_12,I expect you to not do something out of impulse like that.
E_H2_Main_4_3_13,"Hey, don't nag at me like that. I do everything for a reason,"
E_H2_Main_4_3_14,you ungrateful oaf.
E_H2_Main_4_3_15,"For your information, I am also born from darkness."
E_H2_Main_4_3_16,"I’m a well-mannered demonic sword who doesn't disturb my kin when they hunt, you know."
E_H2_Main_4_3_17,Good luck surviving on your own with that small-minded skull of yours. Kyahahaha!
E_H2_Main_4_3_18,...
E_H2_Main_4_3_19,"Mister, are you alright?"
E_H2_Main_4_3_20,Did that sword say something to you again?
E_H2_Main_4_3_21,"No, it’s nothing."
E_H2_Main_4_3_22,"Hey, you! Stop bothering Mister Bernheim! I’m gonna kick your butt if you don’t!"
E_H2_Main_4_3_23,Pfff! What a nosy little girl!
E_H2_Main_4_3_24,"Oi, Bernheim! Get this girl off me!!"
E_H2_Main_4_3_25,How did you all get into this mansion?
E_H2_Main_4_3_26,We met an employee at the Orvel Plaza!
E_H2_Main_4_3_27,"We were told that this was a haunted mansion-themed event, and we were invited inside!"
E_H2_Main_4_3_28,"It was the same for you too, right, Mitra?"
E_H2_Main_4_3_29,Yes. I wouldn’t have entered this creepy place
E_H2_Main_4_3_30,if that crazy woman hadn’t pushed me through the gate.
E_H2_Main_4_3_31,Hmm... Interesting. You all came here through a method different from mine.
E_H2_Main_4_3_32,"Well duh, this mansion is gluttonously gathering all the darkness around the area!"
E_H2_Main_4_3_33,No wonder both of us were drawn into it without realizing!
E_H2_Main_4_3_34,Heard that we have to find some kind of secret to get out.
E_H2_Main_4_3_35,"So this was a mansion where people kept disappearing, yeah?"
E_H2_Main_4_3_36,"I thought it would be best if we search for the vanished workers of the mansion,"
E_H2_Main_4_3_37,but there seems to be no one here but us...
E_H2_Main_4_3_38,Um...
E_H2_Main_4_3_39,I don’t think... we need to look for them...
E_H2_Main_4_3_40,Have you discovered something?
E_H2_Main_4_3_41,Yes... If what’s written in this book is true...
E_H2_Main_4_3_42,The vanished workers... they...
E_H2_Main_4_3_43,were used to either draw in darkness...
E_H2_Main_4_3_44,or for the experiment to transform them into monsters... But that subject is...
E_H2_Main_4_3_45,"what your sword just ate, Sir Bernheim."
E_H2_Main_4_3_46,*Burp*
E_H2_Main_4_3_47,...
E_H2_Main_5_1_1,"Haha, hahahahaha! This is perfect!!"
E_H2_Main_5_1_2,The method I used to draw and gather darkness has been a success.
E_H2_Main_5_1_3,"Now, an immensely powerful darkness which not even the divine power\nor the power of light can purify has been gathered."
E_H2_Main_5_1_4,It is incomparable to the worthless garbages I’ve developed until now.
E_H2_Main_5_1_5,"If I succeed, if I manage to nurture the darkness further,"
E_H2_Main_5_1_6,I will emerge as the one with the power that rivals that of the ancient darkness.
E_H2_Main_5_1_7,So long as I have this power...
E_H2_Main_5_1_8,So long as I have this darkness...
E_H2_Main_5_1_9,Looks like that was the last of the research materials from the study.
E_H2_Main_5_1_10,So what advisor Idrian said was true.
E_H2_Main_5_1_11,"While I don't understand its exact purpose and use as Idrian can,"
E_H2_Main_5_1_12,it's clear that this is dark magic.
E_H2_Main_5_1_13,I guess the mechanism is to gather the darkness from the surrounding area and then transplant the core to shift the form of the user.
E_H2_Main_5_1_14,"If one uses this magic, he or she would become a being that’s neither human, Demon, nor a being of darkness."
E_H2_Main_5_1_15,What was this person trying to do with such magic?
E_H2_Main_5_1_16,"...Whatever the intention was, I have to find and destroy this core"
E_H2_Main_5_1_17,before it completes its form.
E_H2_Main_5_1_17_1,Phew! I’m glad that there’s something that mister can wear.
E_H2_Main_5_1_17_2,I thought this place was really old. Didn’t expect to find something usable!
E_H2_Main_5_1_17_3,...I believe this is not necessary.
E_H2_Main_5_1_17_4,(I feel something odd about this clothing...)
E_H2_Main_5_1_17_5,"So where are we going, Leo?"
E_H2_Main_5_1_18,I believe we can find more materials in the study...
E_H2_Main_5_1_19,I think this person actually researched the da-dark power in detail.
E_H2_Main_5_1_20,"(Ah, were there others in this mansion too?)"
E_H2_Main_5_1_21,It's so hard to find a study in a mansion this huge!
E_H2_Main_5_1_22,Wish they gave us a map to make our lives easier!
E_H2_Main_5_1_23,"Who knows, this literally might be a haunted mansion."
E_H2_Main_5_1_24,Doubt they'll be that kind.
E_H2_Main_5_1_25,(That voice... Mitra?! But Mitra was..!)
E_H2_Main_5_1_26,It would be nice if there is a sign in front of a door written ‘Study.'
E_H2_Main_5_1_27,"The mansion is very big, but I don’t think we should expect-"
E_H2_Main_5_1_28,A sign...
E_H2_Main_5_1_29,Hooray! We've found the study!
E_H2_Main_5_1_30,We should keep our guards up
E_H2_Main_5_1_31,in case something dangerous appears again.
E_H2_Main_5_2_1,W-wow... So many books.
E_H2_Main_5_2_2,A room this big 
E_H2_Main_5_2_3,should surely hold information that will help our investigation.
E_H2_Main_5_2_4,"At a glance, most of the books here seem to be about dark magic."
E_H2_Main_5_2_5,"Wow, you can recognize books like that?!"
E_H2_Main_5_2_6,(I learned about them as I researched the power of the light...)
E_H2_Main_5_2_7,(I should try not to look suspicious.)
E_H2_Main_5_2_8,Ahem...
E_H2_Main_5_2_9,"Haha, looks like he doesn't want to answer!"
E_H2_Main_5_2_10,Maybe I brought up a sensitive topic without realizing it?
E_H2_Main_5_2_11,Let’s rummage through the journals that are still in the study
E_H2_Main_5_2_12,so that Mister Bernheim and Leo can start deciphering straight away.
E_H2_Main_5_2_13,Do you think we should just gather anything with the word ‘darkness’?
E_H2_Main_5_2_14,"Th-that sounds like too much, haha..."
E_H2_Main_5_2_15,"Great, more labor..."
E_H2_Main_5_2_16,The word dark seems to appear once every 3 lines!
E_H2_Main_5_2_17,"You do know that this place is a library of a man obsessed with dark, right?"
E_H2_Main_5_2_18,"Well, it is our job to sort passages that are potentially helpful."
E_H2_Main_5_2_19,"You're a grown man,"
E_H2_Main_5_2_20,stop complaining and just help us here.
E_H2_Main_5_2_21,"Hey, I don’t know anything about magic. How am I supposed to-"
E_H2_Main_5_2_22,...
E_H2_Main_5_2_23,...
E_H2_Main_5_2_24,...
E_H2_Main_5_2_25,"Don’t pretend you don’t know me, Mitra!!"
E_H2_Main_5_2_26,Ahhhhhh! I don’t know! I don’t know! I don’t know you!
E_H2_Main_5_2_27,Stop acting as if you know me!!!
E_H2_Main_5_2_28,What the?! Are you alright?!
E_H2_Main_5_2_29,(That weapon..! It’s the inquisitor!!)
E_H2_Main_5_2_30,"Wait. You there, young lady."
E_H2_Main_5_2_31,I am not your enemy. You do not have to be so alert.
E_H2_Main_5_2_32,You should be wary of...
E_H2_Main_5_2_33,them instead.
E_H2_Main_5_2_34,What?!
E_H2_Main_5_2_35,"I understand why you are pointing at Mitra as he’s scary and bad-tempered,"
E_H2_Main_5_2_36,but why me?!
E_H2_Main_5_2_37,What!? Who’s bad-tempered?!
E_H2_Main_5_2_38,"Cut the sloppy impersonation, you impostors!"
E_H2_Main_5_2_39,I saw you consuming those two victims
E_H2_Main_5_2_40,and swapping the appearance afterward.
E_H2_Main_5_2_41,You shall not deceive me!
E_H2_Main_5_2_43,I thought you would leave quietly after collecting research materials.
E_H2_Main_5_2_44,Why do you have to interfere with our hunt!
E_H2_Main_5_2_45,Inquisitor!! Watch out!
E_H2_Main_5_3_1,"Dammit, they are way too strong!"
E_H2_Main_5_3_2,We have to run!!!
E_H2_Main_5_3_3,Kehehehe! Where do you think you are going?!
E_H2_Main_5_3_4,Outta my way!!!
E_H2_Main_5_3_5,"Targarios, stop!"
E_H2_Main_5_3_6,"Hey, they are running away!"
E_H2_Main_5_3_7,"Wait, there’s no need to chase them."
E_H2_Main_5_3_8,"We’ve already retrieved what we needed. Besides,"
E_H2_Main_5_3_9,we will encounter them again sooner or later as we venture through the halls of this mansion.
E_H2_Main_5_3_10,For now... It would be best to see what state the rest of us are in.
E_H2_Main_5_3_11,"Hm... So you were here too, Bernheim."
E_H2_Main_5_3_12,I agree with your statement.
E_H2_Main_5_3_13,They lurk around the corners of this mansion. They will eventually come for us.
E_H2_Main_5_3_14,"Um, so inquisitor... Is there anything you can tell us about the situation?"
E_H2_Main_5_3_15,"Like, is there anything you know about this mansion?"
E_H2_Main_5_3_16,Or about those rabbits that just vanished?
E_H2_Main_5_3_17,*Ahem* I just saw them getting consumed.
E_H2_Main_5_3_18,"I had already seen that, so I assumed that the same pair that was with you were impostors."
E_H2_Main_5_3_19,(I’m...certain that the advisor knew I would witness that scene.)
E_H2_Main_5_3_20,(Anything related to dark magic is not my specialty. I have no means to detect the dark entities.)
E_H2_Main_5_3_21,"(It would have been challenging to detect those things already inside this place,)"
E_H2_Main_5_3_22,"(But once I saw that scene, I was 100% sure those were the dark entities.)"
E_H2_Main_5_3_23,"(Ugh, the advisor’s method is not good for my sanity.)"
E_H2_Main_5_3_24,He would know better than I do.
E_H2_Main_5_3_25,Mitra's demeanors were oddly different from before.
E_H2_Main_5_3_26,It was just that I was quietly observing him from afar.
E_H2_Main_5_3_27,So the reason why Mitra looked uncomfortable with you was...
E_H2_Main_5_3_28,"That doll devours a person, snatches that person’s body, and ultimately mimics that person."
E_H2_Main_5_3_29,"Mitra happened to be a random prey, but they didn't expect running into someone acquainted with Mitra."
E_H2_Main_5_3_30,...The soul of the original body’s owner is contained within the doll the impostor is carrying.
E_H2_Main_5_3_31,"And for some unknown reason, those impostors lure people in"
E_H2_Main_5_3_32,to hunt their souls.
E_H2_Main_5_3_33,"If you stayed with those impostors longer, they would have attempted to devour you one at a time."
E_H2_Main_5_3_34,Then Mitra and Dosarta...
E_H2_Main_5_3_35,Are they okay now?
E_H2_Main_5_3_36,I-I can't believe we were exploring with the impostors right next to us...
E_H2_Main_5_3_37,I-I’m so scared now...
E_H2_Main_5_3_38,"Th-then, the stories of the haunted mansion... Are those lies as well?"
E_H2_Main_5_3_39,"A-also, who were those employees that made us enter?"
E_H2_Main_5_3_40,Is there a story behind this mansion?
E_H2_Main_5_3_41,"Yes. Apparently, a mad nobleman used his staff as experiment subjects"
E_H2_Main_5_3_42,and turned them into monsters.
E_H2_Main_5_3_43,W-we also ran into those monsters a while back...
E_H2_Main_5_3_44,"Unfortunately, those stories are true."
E_H2_Main_5_3_45,"I found a handwritten entry in this study,"
E_H2_Main_5_3_46,and it looks like it was written by the nobleman who laid his hands on dark magic.
E_H2_Main_5_3_47,Although the entry begins with him trying to revive his dead wife...
E_H2_Main_5_3_48,You all should read this.
E_H2_Main_5_3_49,"Ugh... We've been trying to deny it,"
E_H2_Main_5_3_50,but looks like we have to accept the facts now.
E_H2_Main_5_3_51,N-no...
E_H2_Main_5_3_52,"This is by no means, a casual horror-themed mock adventure."
E_H2_Main_5_3_53,This mansion is a place where actual... dark magic experiments were carried out.
E_H2_Main_6_1_1,...
E_H2_Main_6_1_2,"You really don't look well, Leo."
E_H2_Main_6_1_3,Is it because you're scared?
E_H2_Main_6_1_4,"Th-that does add to all of this,"
E_H2_Main_6_1_5,but I’m also feeling the dark energy getting stronger...
E_H2_Main_6_1_6,I’m getting more anxious...
E_H2_Main_6_1_7,I thought that the secret passage I found in the study
E_H2_Main_6_1_8,"was the exit,"
E_H2_Main_6_1_9,"but seeing how the dark energy is getting stronger, maybe that passage wasn’t the exit."
E_H2_Main_6_1_10,"W-we are not going to get locked here forever, right?"
E_H2_Main_6_1_11,We are trapped here due to a specific power.
E_H2_Main_6_1_12,"If we can remove that, the door will surely open."
E_H2_Main_6_1_13,"Do not be so afraid, boy."
E_H2_Main_6_1_14,(B-boy...)
E_H2_Main_6_1_15,Is there anything you know?
E_H2_Main_6_1_16,I was in the study before you all came.
E_H2_Main_6_1_17,I had some time to investigate.
E_H2_Main_6_1_18,"According to the entry, the master of this mansion"
E_H2_Main_6_1_19,"laid his hands on the power of darkness to resurrect his dead wife,"
E_H2_Main_6_1_20,"but in the end, he lost his mind and goal, bringing destruction upon himself."
E_H2_Main_6_1_21,Kehehehe. So he had no idea how much he could handle
E_H2_Main_6_1_22,and just kept on piling up like a fool.
E_H2_Main_6_1_23,"Well! If it was me doing that, nothing like this would've happened!"
E_H2_Main_6_1_24,The master of the mansion ultimately became a monster who feeds on the darkness around him.
E_H2_Main_6_1_25,"The darkness spread indiscriminatingly,"
E_H2_Main_6_1_26,so a couple of dozen priests from the Church of Lua had to combine their strength to seal it. Apparently they barely succeeded.
E_H2_Main_6_1_27,So the power of darkness is that dangerous?
E_H2_Main_6_1_28,...
E_H2_Main_6_1_29,Hey! Don't just go around calling everything with dark power bad.
E_H2_Main_6_1_30,"We have no choice but to live the way we were shaped, you know."
E_H2_Main_6_1_31,"...Don’t say something so trivial as that, Targarios."
E_H2_Main_6_1_32,*Ahem* We are wary of the dark power because it is still an unknown area to us.
E_H2_Main_6_1_33,"When you look at dark power itself on its own,"
E_H2_Main_6_1_34,it’s not so different from other elements that form this world.
E_H2_Main_6_1_35,I-I’ve only heard bad things about dark power so...
E_H2_Main_6_1_36,There's also that monster in this mansion too...
E_H2_Main_6_1_37,Power changes shape depending on who wields it.
E_H2_Main_6_1_38,The bad impression is because of the rather... horrible outcome of those 
E_H2_Main_6_1_39,who are unable to control the power.
E_H2_Main_6_1_40,But that doesn’t mean darkness itself is bad.
E_H2_Main_6_1_41,...
E_H2_Main_6_1_42,(Then does she think that the power the Empire is currently exerting
E_H2_Main_6_1_43,is a righteous power?)
E_H2_Main_6_1_44,(It is not righteous if so many people are suffering...)
E_H2_Main_6_1_45,(A power obtained through driving many others to suffer...)
E_H2_Main_6_1_46,(The power that the Emperor is exerting... what’s the difference between that and dark power?)
E_H2_Main_6_1_47,Ce-Cecilia?
E_H2_Main_6_1_48,Ah! Sorry! Got a bit sidetracked there!
E_H2_Main_6_1_49,"Well, there's only one way."
E_H2_Main_6_1_50,"Let’s march on straight! We might run into something eventually, hahaha!"
E_H2_Main_6_2_1,Th-there are so many dolls in this room...
E_H2_Main_6_2_2,"If these dolls are the same as the other dolls in this mansion,"
E_H2_Main_6_2_3,they might also be...dangerous.
E_H2_Main_6_2_4,"I’m not spotting any unusual movement,"
E_H2_Main_6_2_5,but it wouldn’t hurt to keep our guards up.
E_H2_Main_6_2_6,Huh? There's something inside the doll...
E_H2_Main_6_2_7,...
E_H2_Main_6_2_8,I caught something!
E_H2_Main_6_2_9,Ahhh!
E_H2_Main_6_2_10,Leo!!!
E_H2_Main_6_2_11,Why you!!! Release Leo at once!
E_H2_Main_6_2_12,Young lady! Be careful of that thing inside!
E_H2_Main_6_2_13,Meddlers... I will make you regret coming this far...
E_H2_Main_6_2_14,"Kehaha! I thought they were a timid coward, but it looks like they got some guts!!"
E_H2_Main_6_2_15,"Hey, Bernheim!"
E_H2_Main_6_2_16,That kid consumed all sorts of darkness!
E_H2_Main_6_2_17,"If I eat that him, I should be able to sleep for 3 days straight without eating anything"
E_H2_Main_6_2_18,because of how full I may get!!
E_H2_Main_6_2_19,"That is, if I can actually sleep, kehehe!"
E_H2_Main_6_2_20,Do not disturb...
E_H2_Main_6_2_21,our hunt!!
E_H2_Main_6_2_22,...So it's trying to make a magical field to trap us in.
E_H2_Main_6_2_23,"Stay together and don’t get separated. Otherwise, we will get split."
E_H2_Main_6_2_24,Looks like a fight is inevitable.
E_H2_Main_6_2_25,Ahhhh!
E_H2_Main_6_2_26,Inquisitor! Mister Bernheim!!!
E_H2_Main_6_3_1,Haaaa! Crushing Kick!!
E_H2_Main_6_3_2,So Leo is inside this big thing?
E_H2_Main_6_3_3,Spit him out now!
E_H2_Main_6_3_4,Waaah...
E_H2_Main_6_3_5,Leo!!! 
E_H2_Main_6_3_6,Ce-Cecilia? Ugh...
E_H2_Main_6_3_7,Ah! Can both of you hear me?!
E_H2_Main_6_3_8,Are you okay?!
E_H2_Main_6_3_9,Hraaaagh!!
E_H2_Main_6_3_10,Hyaa!
E_H2_Main_6_3_11,Bernheim! Inquisitor!! You are both alright!
E_H2_Main_6_3_12,There's a ray of light behind the target that looks like the exit.
E_H2_Main_6_3_13,"Our priority is to get out of this mansion, so run!!!"
E_H2_Main_6_3_14,Okay!!!
E_H2_Main_6_3_15,Bernheim! I will leave Leo to you!!
E_H2_Main_6_3_16,Alright.
E_H2_Main_6_3_19,Phew...
E_H2_Main_6_3_20,This is... Orvel Plaza?
E_H2_Main_6_3_21,That mansion door must have been connected to here!
E_H2_Main_6_3_22,Haha... Hehehe... Looks like it... 
E_H2_Main_6_3_23,That was the worst event ever...
E_H2_Main_6_3_23_1,"Hmm? Bernheim, where's your loud-mouthed sword?"
E_H2_Main_6_3_23_2,...I have no idea. He just disappeared.
E_H2_Main_6_3_23_3,(I thought that sword stayed with Bernheim at all times...)
E_H2_Main_6_3_24,How did we end up flown into a mansion filled with darkness?
E_H2_Main_6_3_25,Maybe the portal that sent us is malfunctioning?
E_H2_Main_6_3_26,We should warn the staff so that other people don't end up there!
E_H2_Main_6_3_27,Hehehe...
E_H2_Main_6_3_28,Welcome!
E_H2_Main_6_3_29,How are you enjoying the Halloween costume parade?
E_H2_Main_6_3_30,You need to stop the haunted mansion event now!!
E_H2_Main_6_3_31,Pardon??
E_H2_Main_6_3_32,A haunted mansion event?
E_H2_Main_6_3_33,Yes! That event where people have to explore the mansion with ghosts!
E_H2_Main_6_3_34,"Um, I’m sorry but in our list of prepared Halloween events for this year,"
E_H2_Main_6_3_35,there’s no haunted mansion exploration event!
E_H2_Main_6_3_36,Perhaps you mistook it with another event?
E_H2_Main_6_3_37,...
E_H2_Main_6_3_38,...What?
E_H2_Main_7_1_1,"That was a successful hunt, considering it was your first time."
E_H2_Main_7_1_2,I think you have enough power in you now.
E_H2_Main_7_1_3,You shouldn’t have to worry about being vanished for a while.
E_H2_Main_7_1_4,But we didn't have to go through all this
E_H2_Main_7_1_5,if we had absorbed all the darkness from the mansion.
E_H2_Main_7_1_6,You are absolutely right.
E_H2_Main_7_1_7,"That is, if you were capable of digesting all that darkness."
E_H2_Main_7_1_8,You are all still too young and small.
E_H2_Main_7_1_9,Darkness of such size is too much for you.
E_H2_Main_7_1_10,"The darkness would have instead consumed you, and use you as fuel to activate the Eclipse."
E_H2_Main_7_1_11,You should start by consuming smaller darkness and work your way up.
E_H2_Main_7_1_12,You have to get stronger as the ones who tread on darkness.
E_H2_Main_7_1_13,Will the other we be safe as long as this darkness exists?
E_H2_Main_7_1_14,Did you say they were close to disappearing?
E_H2_Main_7_1_15,But it looks like they transformed back to their original form.
E_H2_Main_7_1_16,"Look, they're here to greet you."
E_H2_Main_7_1_17,!!
E_H2_Main_7_1_18,G-give us...
E_H2_Main_7_1_19,Give us back! Don’t do evil things with us!
E_H2_Main_7_1_20,I-If you don’t give us back...
E_H2_Main_7_1_21,!!!!
E_H2_Main_7_1_22,...Eh?
E_H2_Main_7_1_23,I missed you...
E_H2_Main_7_1_24,I’m so glad you are alright...
E_H2_Main_7_1_25,Huh???
E_H2_Main_7_1_26,"Fufufu, you really are in good terms."
E_H2_Main_7_1_27,What a lovely darkness. Just like you've said.
E_H2_Main_7_1_28,Y-you weren't doing something evil with us?
E_H2_Main_7_1_29,Not really.
E_H2_Main_7_1_30,"To us, this is just like eating a meal."
E_H2_Main_7_1_30_1,"I mean, the humans that came to the mansion did fall unconscious, but still."
E_H2_Main_7_1_31,No one died and no one got hurt... This isn’t even close to the definition of evil.
E_H2_Main_7_1_31_1,"Once they open their eyes, they will think that it was just a bad dream."
E_H2_Main_7_1_32,I-is it?
E_H2_Main_7_1_33,"Every being has its own unique method of survival,"
E_H2_Main_7_1_34,and darkness can also co-exist with others.
E_H2_Main_7_1_35,We just have a little different way of living.
E_H2_Main_7_1_36,Way of living?
E_H2_Main_7_1_37,"Yes. To other races, we are labeled as an unknown horror."
E_H2_Main_7_1_38,"That’s because some reckless fools went extreme to survive,"
E_H2_Main_7_1_39,ultimately destroying themselves.
E_H2_Main_7_1_40,We want to live peacefully with everyone...
E_H2_Main_7_1_41,We don't want people to be afraid of us...
E_H2_Main_7_1_42,We want to make friends...
E_H2_Main_7_1_43,"Although you are only small spirits,"
E_H2_Main_7_1_44,there are several of you combined together.
E_H2_Main_7_1_45,That means you need more strength than others.
E_H2_Main_7_1_46,"If you cannot secure enough strength,"
E_H2_Main_7_1_47,"the soul with the weakest connection to you will fall out, just like this time."
E_H2_Main_7_1_48,You won't be able to maintain your shape.
E_H2_Main_7_1_49,We don't want to make people suffer...
E_H2_Main_7_1_50,But we also don’t want to disappear...
E_H2_Main_7_1_51,Fufu... You are all so kindhearted...
E_H2_Main_7_1_52,I will say though that you don’t necessarily have to make others fear you.
E_H2_Main_7_1_53,That doesn't have to be your way of life.
E_H2_Main_7_1_54,This time though... It was urgent. Something had to be done.
E_H2_Main_7_1_55,"Since you mentioned it, let's get started."
E_H2_Main_7_1_56,I want you to learn how to live as darkness in this world.
E_H2_Main_7_2_1,"Hm, impressive..."
E_H2_Main_7_2_2,Looks like your power is stable now. This should be enough.
E_H2_Main_7_2_3,This is...
E_H2_Main_7_2_4,The thing from before.
E_H2_Main_7_2_5,You said it was dangerous for us. Why give this to us now?
E_H2_Main_7_2_6,It should be fine for you now.
E_H2_Main_7_2_7,Back then you were so weak that you couldn't even maintain your shape.
E_H2_Main_7_2_8,"That was a dangerous time, but now you are fine."
E_H2_Main_7_2_9,"Also, this is just a tiny portion of it."
E_H2_Main_7_2_10,I will take care of the rest. Don't worry.
E_H2_Main_7_2_11,I... Um...
E_H2_Main_7_2_12,What is it?
E_H2_Main_7_2_13,Thank you... for helping us...
E_H2_Main_7_2_14,We didn't know you were a good person... We misunderstood...
E_H2_Main_7_2_15,Can you tell us... your name?
E_H2_Main_7_2_16,"Oh, I haven't told you my name yet, have I?"
E_H2_Main_7_2_17,My name is Lewisia.
E_H2_Main_7_2_18,"I may look different from you, but I am also of the darkness. A vampire, to be exact."
E_H2_Main_7_2_19,Lewisia...
E_H2_Main_7_2_20,Tee hee... Now I know your name.
E_H2_Main_7_2_21,Thank you for teaching us so much...
E_H2_Main_7_2_22,You don't have to thank me. 
E_H2_Main_7_2_23,It is also my duty to look after young darkness such as you.
E_H2_Main_7_2_24,...
E_H2_Main_7_2_25,(An evil spirit which is an amalgam of little souls and darkness...)
E_H2_Main_7_2_26,(I did hear that the giant darkness that awakened in Aegina feeds upon souls.)
E_H2_Main_7_2_27,(Should she run into it...)
E_H2_Main_7_2_28,(She will be feasted upon.)
E_H2_Main_7_2_29,(She will not be able to resist even a bit.)
E_H2_Main_7_2_30,Lewisia?
E_H2_Main_7_2_31,"If you think you are going to be lonely for a while, why don't you come with me?"
E_H2_Main_7_2_32,Eh? Huh?!
E_H2_Main_7_2_33,"Fufu. Actually, at my age, I get lonely from time to time."
E_H2_Main_7_2_34,"If you follow me and learn new things along the way,"
E_H2_Main_7_2_35,you will get used to human society in no time.
E_H2_Main_7_2_36,R-really?
E_H2_Main_7_2_37,You will really let us come with you?
E_H2_Main_7_2_38,Of course.
E_H2_Main_7_2_39,I will introduce you to my friends too.
E_H2_Main_7_2_40,They are fun to talk to. You will get along with them in no time.
E_H2_Main_7_2_41,Ehehe... Hehe...
E_H2_Main_7_2_42,I’m going to make new friends? That makes me... so happy!
E_H2_Main_7_2_43,"I can't wait, Lewisia!!"
E_F1_Main1_0,Hmm...
E_F1_Main1_1,Hello there!
E_F1_Main1_2,I had to deal with so many customers lately that I wasn't able to eat prop- Huh?
E_F1_Main1_3,"Juno, is everything okay?"
E_F1_Main1_4,"Huh? Oh, it's you, May."
E_F1_Main1_5,"Well, it's been really hot lately..."
E_F1_Main1_6,and all the customers were looking drained.
E_F1_Main1_7,I'm trying to think of a dish that will give them more stamina.
E_F1_Main1_8,I just feel like the menus I have right now aren't enough.
E_F1_Main1_9,"Hm, then why don't you ask your customers?"
E_F1_Main1_10,"Since people from all over the place visit your inn,"
E_F1_Main1_11,maybe you can hear all kinds of information on different cuisines from them.
E_F1_Main1_12,"Yeah, I'm already doing that..."
E_F1_Main1_13,But listening to stories and actually trying out these dishes are completely different.
E_F1_Main1_14,Hang on... That's it!
E_F1_Main1_15,Huh?
E_F1_Main1_16,I'm gonna go study cooking in different places!
E_F1_Main1_17,Take care May! I'll be back soon!
E_F1_Main1_18,"From now on, Juno's Inn is on holiday!"
E_F1_Main1_19,"Can I borrow a few items from your shop, May? Thanks!"
E_F1_Main1_20,...
E_F1_Main1_21,What about my lunch though... Aww...
E_F1_Main2_1,"Yanne,"
E_F1_Main2_2,Thank you so much for accepting my request on such short notice.
E_F1_Main2_3,"Ahaha, don't mention it!"
E_F1_Main2_4,It's not like this is the first time we've done this.
E_F1_Main2_5,"True, but I feel like this trip might take a while..."
E_F1_Main2_6,And it's not like our usual monster hunting trips. It's an escort mission...
E_F1_Main2_7,"If a monster appears while I escort you, I hunt it down. same thing."
E_F1_Main2_8,Don't sweat about it. This is good for me too.
E_F1_Main2_9,??
E_F1_Main2_10,"The plan is to visit Elidora, Ogria, and then Arrovina,"
E_F1_Main2_11,"so you can taste the cuisine of each region for inspiration, right?"
E_F1_Main2_12,"Since I'm interested in cooking as well, this trip sounds whole a lot of fun."
E_F1_Main2_13,"Right, right."
E_F1_Main2_14,...Hold on.
E_F1_Main2_15,But you usually cook odd dishes with monster parts...
E_F1_Main2_16,Huh? Odd?
E_F1_Main2_17,"It's pretty common among monster hunters, though."
E_F1_Main2_18,"They're full of protein, quite filling, and pretty tasty too!"
E_F1_Main2_19,I highly recommend it to people that want to bulk up.
E_F1_Main2_20,Ahahaha...
E_F1_Main2_21,"I guess for your...unique constitution, that kind of food would fit better."
E_F1_Main2_22,"What was it again? You have a smaller build compared to ordinary people, but have extraordinary muscle density..."
E_F1_Main2_23,...
E_F1_Main2_24,I get the muscles but I'm not sure if you fall under a 'smaller' build...
E_F1_Main2_25,"Aw well, I'm pretty small for a female Barbarian."
E_F1_Main2_26,My mom is quite short but she's still taller than me.
E_F1_Main2_27,I think she's around 6'6''... Maybe a bit shorter than that.
E_F1_Main2_28,...
E_F1_Main2_29,Alright. Break time is over.
E_F1_Main2_30,We should get moving if we want to meet the Elves of Elidora by today.
E_F1_Main2_31,"Ah, yes. Let's go."
E_F1_Main3_1,"Oh, look, Selene! Humans! Wow, it's been so long!"
E_F1_Main3_2,Hello!
E_F1_Main3_3,Pleased to meet you! I am Juno! I run the Hero's Inn at Orvel.
E_F1_Main3_4,"And this is my escort, Yanne."
E_F1_Main3_5,"It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Selene, the Princess of Elidora."
E_F1_Main3_6,And I'm Dosarta! Nice to meet you!
E_F1_Main3_7,What brings you to Elidora? Are you...here to visit the Tower of Challenge?!
E_F1_Main3_8,"Nope, it's not that."
E_F1_Main3_9,"It's just that since the hot weather has left everyone exhausted,"
E_F1_Main3_10,I wanted to search for good stamina-filling dishes.
E_F1_Main3_11,"That said, can I ask you if there are any Elven dishes you know that are good stamina-rechargers?"
E_F1_Main3_12,Hmm... Good for stamina...
E_F1_Main3_13,"So you want people to feel more energetic, right?"
E_F1_Main3_14,"Sis, how about that bread?"
E_F1_Main3_15,The magical bread made by the Druids..
E_F1_Main3_16,"Hmm, it certainly does...restore stamina, alright."
E_F1_Main3_17,But I believe you need to use the magic of the Druids to make it...
E_F1_Main3_18,"Ahaha, I'm afraid I can't make magical foods."
E_F1_Main3_19,"Though, can I ask what ingredients are used to make that bread?"
E_F1_Main3_20,I'm sure that a magical bread like that would require extraordinary ingredients to make.
E_F1_Main3_21,The bread itself is made with common grains that can be found anywhere.
E_F1_Main3_22,But there is a secret ingredient that Lorraine adds to make it special.
E_F1_Main3_23,Honey containing Elidora's essence that has a great healing effect.
E_F1_Main3_24,However...
E_F1_Main3_25,However?
E_F1_Main3_26,A swarm of monstrous mutant wasps has been causing quite a stir lately.
E_F1_Main3_27,These monsters have been attacking normal bees and destroying their hives.
E_F1_Main3_28,"We were going to help the Druids to drive these pests away, but... we're short-handed."
E_F1_Main3_29,"Ah, we'd love to help out."
E_F1_Main3_30,This friend here is actually a well-known monster hunter.
E_F1_Main3_31,In return though...
E_F1_Main3_32,Yes?
E_F1_Main3_33,Could we get some of the honey after the job?
E_F1_Main3_34,"Oh, of course. You may take as much as you want."
E_F1_Main3_35,"You okay with this, Yanne?"
E_F1_Main3_36,Of course. It's the right thing to do to help people out when they need us.
E_F1_Main3_37,"To think about it though, it's a shame..."
E_F1_Main3_38,Wasps don't have many cookable parts.
E_F1_Main3_39,...
E_F1_Main4_1,This is the den of the wasp monsters.
E_F1_Main4_2,We must be careful as there are a lot of-
E_F1_Main4_3,"That's Elidora for you, alright."
E_F1_Main4_4,These wasps are huge compared to the wasps from other forests.
E_F1_Main4_5,A normal person might die from just one venomous sting...
E_F1_Main4_6,"The number of wasps do grow when it gets warm,"
E_F1_Main4_7,but there are just too many mutated wasps this year. They've been causing so much damage...
E_F1_Main4_8,There are too many of them. I don't think we can wipe them out at once.
E_F1_Main4_9,I think we should divert their attention first.
E_F1_Main4_10,I will distract them.
E_F1_Main4_11,I'll just sneak over there...
E_F1_Main4_12,Oops!
E_F1_Main4_13,...
E_F1_Main4_14,Dosarta...
E_F1_Main4_15,Ahaha... Hahahaha... Sorry...
E_F1_Main4_16,"Waaah, a swarm of wasps!"
E_F1_Main4_17,"Haha, looks like we are in for a fight."
E_F1_Main4_18,"Over here, you pests!"
E_F1_Main4_19,Bring it on!
E_F1_Main5_1,"Whew, we got rid of them all somehow."
E_F1_Main5_2,I feel like I'm gonna get traumatized by wasps..
E_F1_Main5_3,Ha... I'm just glad that the problem has been taken care of.
E_F1_Main5_4,Thank you both for your assistance.
E_F1_Main5_5,"Yanne, was it?"
E_F1_Main5_6,You possess such great power.
E_F1_Main5_7,"Ahaha, I'm flattered."
E_F1_Main5_8,It was nothing.
E_F1_Main5_9,"Ugh, I'm so sorry! I caused you trouble..."
E_F1_Main5_10,"By the way, are you really sure you don't need more honey?"
E_F1_Main5_11,You only took a few jars...
E_F1_Main5_12,"Oh, it's okay. They're just for experiments anyways."
E_F1_Main5_13,"And if I need more, I know where to come."
E_F1_Main5_14,"Since we got what we came here for, we'll take our leave now."
E_F1_Main5_15,Heh... Take care.
E_F1_Main5_16,I hope that our paths cross again.
E_F1_Main5_17,Byeeeee!
E_F1_Main5_18,Please come visit the Tower of Challenge next time you visit!
E_F1_Main5_19,"...So Yanne,"
E_F1_Main5_20,what's that you've got there?
E_F1_Main5_21,"Oh, just some usable stuff."
E_F1_Main5_22,"Poison stings, legs, and wings from the wasps..."
E_F1_Main5_23,Hmm? What's with that face?
E_F1_Main5_24,You... You're not going to cook-
E_F1_Main5_25,"Oh no, just the legs for cooking."
E_F1_Main5_26,But I have other uses for the poison stings and wings.
E_F1_Main5_27,"Eh, why are you making that face?"
E_F1_Main5_28,Why are you backing away?
E_F1_Main6_1,So this is Ogria...
E_F1_Main6_2,The land of the Orcs.
E_F1_Main6_3,"Yes, Orc cuisine usually consists of meat."
E_F1_Main6_4,The most well-known dish is their wild boar delicacy.
E_F1_Main6_5,I wonder what kind of sauce they use to get that kind of flavor...
E_F1_Main6_6,"Ah, I've heard stories about the wild boar barbecue dishes of the Orcs."
E_F1_Main6_7,"Although I've never had any myself,"
E_F1_Main6_8,this will be a good opportunity to learn how to make it.
E_F1_Main6_9,Good thing I know the Chieftain of the tribes here.
E_F1_Main6_10,Let's go see him first.
E_F1_Main7_1,"It's been a while, Dragon Slayer."
E_F1_Main7_2,I assume you received a request for a monster conquest?
E_F1_Main7_3,"Ahaha, I'm on a different duty this time, Chieftain."
E_F1_Main7_4,"More like traveling for a cooking...mission kind of thing, haha."
E_F1_Main7_5,"Greetings, sir Chieftain."
E_F1_Main7_6,I am Juno.
E_F1_Main7_7,I'm currently researching food that has a vitalizing effect.
E_F1_Main7_8,"Ah, a cook."
E_F1_Main7_9,Then you must've come for the traditional dishes of us Orcs.
E_F1_Main7_10,"Yes, the special wild boar dish of the Orcs is quite famous among the travelers who travel to, and from Orvel."
E_F1_Main7_11,Apparently there's this special sauce that makes the dish so delicious...
E_F1_Main7_12,"Ah, yes... That wild boar specialty is our very best feast dish."
E_F1_Main7_13,"Unfortunately, it takes quite a while to make the sauce."
E_F1_Main7_14,"Because of that reason, we don't serve it as much as we'd like."
E_F1_Main7_15,And.. It is also unfortunate that we used all the sauce we had
E_F1_Main7_16,to hold a grand feast for a special guest.
E_F1_Main7_17,My sincerest apologies.
E_F1_Main7_18,"Oh, that's a bummer."
E_F1_Main7_19,"Then, can I ask you about the sauce instead?"
E_F1_Main7_20,"Like how you make it, or what the ingredients are..."
E_F1_Main7_21,"Ah, it's not much, really."
E_F1_Main7_22,The sauce is made of boiled beans that were aged for a long time.
E_F1_Main7_23,Beans?
E_F1_Main7_24,A sauce made of beans can be that delicious..?
E_F1_Main7_25,"Hmm, definitely an interesting concept."
E_F1_Main7_26,How long do you age the beans for?
E_F1_Main7_27,"Ideally, two to three years."
E_F1_Main7_28,"Hmm... So even if we make it right away, we won't be able to use it by this year then..."
E_F1_Main7_29,We can still have a delicious wild boar barbecue without the sauce...
E_F1_Main7_30,Would you like to join our wild boar hunt then?
E_F1_Main7_31,"The wild boars of Ogria during this time of the year are plump, fat, and delicious."
E_F1_Main8_1,"Hohoho, I expected no less from you, Dragon Slayer."
E_F1_Main8_2,It is amazing to see how you've managed to carry all those giant wild boars by yourself.
E_F1_Main8_3,It would normally take two warriors of the tribe to carry just one wild boar of that size... hoho.
E_F1_Main8_4,"Haha, this is no big deal."
E_F1_Main8_5,"But as we're still in the middle of our trip, we can't take too much..."
E_F1_Main8_6,"Hey Juno, how much meat do you need?"
E_F1_Main8_7,"Well, I borrowed May's bag that has nearly infinite space,"
E_F1_Main8_8,so we can take as much as we'd like.
E_F1_Main8_9,It even has a cooling function!
E_F1_Main8_10,But yeah... taking all three boars would be too much.
E_F1_Main8_11,Let's just take one.
E_F1_Main8_12,"Ahaha, what a convenient bag."
E_F1_Main8_13,Are you really not gonna let me store the wasp legs in there?
E_F1_Main8_14,...
E_F1_Main8_15,"*Sigh* I get it, I get it. Haha..."
E_F1_Main8_16,"Hmm, would you like to take the remaining meat, Chieftain?"
E_F1_Main8_17,I think we have enough now...
E_F1_Main8_18,"Oh, may I? You have our thanks. We were actually in need of extra food for the upcoming events."
E_F1_Main8_19,This will keep us going for a while.
E_F1_Main8_20,"To show our gratitude, we'll send over our sauce as soon the beans finish fermenting."
E_F1_Main8_21,I believe there are a few jars that will be ready in about two months.
E_F1_Main8_22,I'll have them sent to Orvel once they're made.
E_F1_Main8_23,"Ooh, thank you so much, Chieftain Kaulah."
E_F1_Main8_24,"We'll be taking our leave, then."
E_F1_Main8_25,"Ahem, I should call everyone."
E_F1_Main8_26,We'll have a feast toda- Hmm?
E_F1_Main8_27,...
E_F1_Main8_28,...
E_F1_Main8_29,"...Hehe, missed me?"
E_F1_Main8_30,Did I just hear someone say feast?
E_F1_Main8_31,Gimme meat! Orcish wild boar barbecue!
E_F1_Main8_32,*Sigh*
E_F1_Main9_1,"Ah, we have finally reached Arrovina Shore."
E_F1_Main9_2,I've never traveled through Galluah Plains though.
E_F1_Main9_3,It really is impossible to live there...
E_F1_Main9_4,"Yeah. Undead monsters are dangerous, but the real problem is that they move in large numbers."
E_F1_Main9_5,Getting surrounded by them will cause big trouble. It's best to cross through Galluah as fast as possible.
E_F1_Main9_6,That doesn't necessarily mean Arrovina is safe though.
E_F1_Main9_7,Dark Elves aren't exactly friendly folks... and the Gnolls can be bothersome.
E_F1_Main9_8,"Come to think of it, I wonder what kind of food the Gnolls eat."
E_F1_Main9_9,Not much is known about the cuisine of the Gnolls...
E_F1_Main9_10,"Oh, not much, really."
E_F1_Main9_11,They really eat just about anything.
E_F1_Main9_12,I head that they even eat the bones of the Undead.
E_F1_Main9_13,Ew... Gross...
E_F1_Main10_1,"Stop right there, human."
E_F1_Main10_2,What brings you here to Arrovina?
E_F1_Main10_3,"Oh hello! My name is Juno, and I'm a chef from Orvel."
E_F1_Main10_4,I'm currently traveling all over the continent to experience different cultures and research cuisines.
E_F1_Main10_5,Do you mind if I ask about the food of the Dark Elves?
E_F1_Main10_6,...Food? You're an odd one.
E_F1_Main10_7,Are there any specialties that you eat or drink when you are exhausted or feeling unwell?
E_F1_Main10_8,"...Well, we do have biscuits wrapped in moon tree leaves for storage,"
E_F1_Main10_9,but those biscuits are enchanted by the signature magic of the Dark Elves. It won't do much for humans.
E_F1_Main10_10,"Well, is there anything else other than the magic used to make those biscuits?"
E_F1_Main10_11,Like any special ingredients or such?
E_F1_Main10_12,I'm afraid not.
E_F1_Main10_13,We do gather dew drops from the moon tree...
E_F1_Main10_14,But that's to collect the mana of the moon.
E_F1_Main10_15,Huhh... What a shame.
E_F1_Main10_16,Ugh! ARGH!!
E_F1_Main10_17,"Shut up, you piece of trash!"
E_F1_Main10_18,Aieeee!
E_F1_Main10_19,The one that's tied up over there...
E_F1_Main10_20,it looks like he has something to say...
E_F1_Main10_21,Do not concern yourself over him.
E_F1_Main10_22,"He dared to threaten our land,"
E_F1_Main10_23,and he shall pay the price with his life.
E_F1_Main10_24,It's a... Gnoll.
E_F1_Main10_25,What exactly did he do?
E_F1_Main10_26,They gathered and cursed the royal family of the Dark Elves.
E_F1_Main10_27,That alone deserves the death penalty.
E_F1_Main10_28,"Oh actually, on our way here, we did run into a Gnoll that was running away..."
E_F1_Main10_29,Is that true?!
E_F1_Main10_30,I must go capture it at once!
E_F1_Main10_31,"I give you my thanks, human."
E_F1_Main10_32,...
E_F1_Main10_33,...
E_F1_Main10_34,...Was there a Gnoll on our way here?
E_F1_Main10_35,...There is now.
E_F1_Main10_36,"Eh, you lied so you can let go of this Gnoll?"
E_F1_Main10_37,"Oof, here you go. Well, yes. You could say that."
E_F1_Main10_38,Just because he said some stuff doesn't mean he should die...
E_F1_Main10_39,Wahahaha...
E_F1_Main10_40,O' good mistress! Thank you so much!
E_F1_Main10_41,Thank you so so so so much for saving me!
E_F1_Main10_42,Agkakahahakahak!
E_F1_Main10_43,Wow... Such an overwhelming expression of gratitude...
E_F1_Main10_44,*Sob* *Sob*
E_F1_Main10_45,Just because I said some things... they just captured me...
E_F1_Main10_46,It simply isn't fair... Wahhhh!
E_F1_Main10_47,"Well, tread along. You don't want to get caught again."
E_F1_Main10_48,"We should leave as well, Juno."
E_F1_Main10_49,"Eh?! No, mistress! You can't leave me! I'll surely get caught again!"
E_F1_Main10_50,Please help me! Help the poor Gnoll! *whines*
E_F1_Main10_51,"Hey, hey! Calm down there!"
E_F1_Main10_52,Let go of me!
E_F1_Main10_53,"...Wait, I have an idea."
E_F1_Main10_54,Huh?
E_F1_Main10_55,"...You, come here."
E_F1_Main10_56,"Eh? Mistress, what-"
E_F1_Main10_57,In. Here.
E_F1_Main10_58,What? Eh? Ahhh... Aaaaah!
E_F1_Main10_59,You won't get caught now.
E_F1_Main10_60,...Ahaha.
E_F1_Main11_1,...
E_F1_Main11_2,We should be safe now.
E_F1_Main11_3,"Oof, you can come out now!"
E_F1_Main11_4,Keh!
E_F1_Main11_5,"Ah, sorry about that."
E_F1_Main11_6,Will you be okay on your own from here?
E_F1_Main11_7,"Ugh... Yes, I should be fine."
E_F1_Main11_8,"But inside that... thing, it's so cold I need to warm up first-"
E_F1_Main11_9,Achoo!
E_F1_Main11_10,Ahahaha... I guess its cooling function is too good. Perhaps I can use it like a freezer!
E_F1_Main11_11,"I'm sorry, I should've put in a coat or something."
E_F1_Main11_12,"Hehe... No worries, mistress. Thank you so much."
E_F1_Main11_13,I'm just grateful to be alive!
E_F1_Main11_14,Hmm... I'd love to pay back the favor.
E_F1_Main11_15,Is there anything I can do for you?
E_F1_Main11_16,"Ah, you were talking about cuisine to that Dark Elf, right?"
E_F1_Main11_17,"Hehe, then I can tell you about the food of the Gnolls!"
E_F1_Main11_18,"Uh, um, s-sure."
E_F1_Main11_19,Preferably without any bones...
E_F1_Main11_20,Bone broth?
E_F1_Main11_21,But bone broth is really good for you.
E_F1_Main11_22,"Add water, animal bones, and meat on the shell of an Ore Tortoise, then you boil them all together!"
E_F1_Main11_23,And you'll get a filling bowl of soup that will strengthen the body with warm energy!
E_F1_Main11_24,Eh? Hold on.
E_F1_Main11_25,So you don't use the bones of the Undead?
E_F1_Main11_26,Huh? We only use those low-grade ingredients when we fail to get any meat.
E_F1_Main11_27,Why would you eat an Undead? It has no edible meat.
E_F1_Main11_28,"I mean, I guess one can eat Undead if there's really no choice... Hehe."
E_F1_Main11_29,Ah... Let's stop that Undead talk there.
E_F1_Main11_30,Where can you find this...Ore Tortoise?
E_F1_Main11_31,"Hmm, if you go a little more west from here, there's a small mountain. There are a lot of them over there."
E_F1_Main11_32,"I'll be going now then, Bye!"
E_F1_Main11_33,Thank you so much for everything! Ehehehe...
E_F1_Main11_34,"Well, it's unfortunate about the cuisine of the Dark Elves, but let bygones be bygones."
E_F1_Main11_35,The shell of the Ore Tortoises sounds interesting though.
E_F1_Main11_36,"Let's go, shall we?"
E_F1_Main12_1,These must be the Ore Tortoises...
E_F1_Main12_2,Do you suppose they just put everything inside the shell and boil it?
E_F1_Main12_3,I feel like we should do a full scan of the components before doing anything...
E_F1_Main12_4,Hmm. Are you saying that there might be something harmful?
E_F1_Main12_5,That's slightly disturbing.
E_F1_Main12_6,"Well, Jin will know what to do about it."
E_F1_Main12_7,I think we have enough ingredients. Let's go back to Orvel.
E_F1_Main12_8,Voila!
E_F1_Main12_9,Honey-aged-wild-boar-meat-stew!
E_F1_Main12_10,...What a long name. I'm just gonna call it Juno's Special Stew. Ahem.
E_F1_Main12_11,"Wow, this looks absolutely delicious."
E_F1_Main12_12,By the way.. This shell... It looks a lot different from what I remember.
E_F1_Main12_13,Jin made a bunch of pots with the tortoise shells we brought.
E_F1_Main12_14,"He made them in assorted sizes, so I can use them depending on the servings."
E_F1_Main12_15,Not to mention that he got rid of all the harmful components of the ore.
E_F1_Main12_16,My special stamina-replenishing dish is ready to go!
E_F1_Main12_17,"Seriously though, this looks amazing."
E_F1_Main12_18,"Ah, but Juno..."
E_F1_Main12_19,Yes?
E_F1_Main12_20,There's a rather large number of customers outside.
E_F1_Main12_21,Isn't this more than usual?
E_F1_Main12_22,"...Ahahahaha, oh my."
E_F1_Main12_23,I guess it's because the shop was temporarily closed.
E_F1_Main12_24,Just the news of my return brought this many...
E_F1_Main12_25,Juno!! Please let me in!
E_F1_Main12_26,Something smells really good! I'm starving...
E_F1_Main12_27,I'm hungry!
E_F1_Main12_28,"Eh, okay, okay!"
E_F1_Main12_29,I'll make it up to you guys for all the missed meals you could have had!
E_F1_Main12_30,Yaaaay!
E_F1_Main13_1,"Whew, what a day."
E_F1_Main13_2,"Great job today, Juno."
E_F1_Main13_3,How did everyone take it?
E_F1_Main13_4,They absolutely loved it.
E_F1_Main13_5,But some did say that something was missing.
E_F1_Main13_6,Is that so? Like what?
E_F1_Main13_7,A dessert. They wanted to have a dessert that would compliment the main dish.
E_F1_Main13_8,"Something that's fruity, sweet, and soft."
E_F1_Main13_9,I guess it's because the dish has a strong flavor.
E_F1_Main13_10,"Ah, I know the perfect thing!"
E_F1_Main13_11,How about jelly?
E_F1_Main13_12,Jelly? You mean the gooey yet soft snack?
E_F1_Main13_13,I can get the ingredients that can produce the taste...
E_F1_Main13_14,But high-quality ingredients can only be obtained through the Empire.
E_F1_Main13_15,"I don't know about the ingredients from the Empire, but I know something that's similar."
E_F1_Main13_16,It won't be easy though...
E_F1_Main13_17,???
E_F1_Main13_18,*Boing boing*
E_F1_Main13_19,...
E_F1_Main13_20,"Haha, let us begin."
E_F1_Main13_21,Time to collect slime gelatin!
E_F1_Main13_22,*Sigh*
E_F1_Main13_23,I knew this would happen.
E_F1_Main13_24,Monster food...
E_F1_Main13_25,"It's okay, it's okay!"
E_F1_Main13_26,Come on! Let the hunt begin!
E_F1_Main14_1,Ugh... It's so slimy. It feels so weird.
E_F1_Main14_2,"Haha, you'll be fine. Just wash it off."
E_F1_Main14_3,"Hmm, so we got everything to use as gelatin..."
E_F1_Main14_4,Now we just need to go back to Orvel and get the fruit extracts.
E_F1_Main14_5,Let's just hurry up and go back... Ugh.
E_F1_Main14_6,"Sure, sure. We should."
E_F1_Main14_7,"If we don't hurry back, that King Slime is going to come back to life."
E_F1_Main14_8,...It doesn't die?
E_F1_Main14_9,No. It doesn't.
E_F1_Main14_10,"Just give it some time to regenerate, and we can collect gelatin again!"
E_F1_Main14_11,Isn't that great?
E_F1_Main14_12,...Can we just import it from the Empire?
E_F1_Main14_13,"Ha, I'm telling you, this is as high-end as it can get."
E_F1_Main14_14,Trust me on this.
E_F1_Main14_15,...
E_F1_Main14_16,Hmm...
E_F1_Main14_17,Hmm...
E_F1_Main14_18,"Ooh, this looks so much better than that time I tried it by myself."
E_F1_Main14_19,"Ahaha, I knew it! Juno, you're the best."
E_F1_Main14_20,...
E_F1_Main14_21,"Well, it does looks edible..."
E_F1_Main14_22,But to think that it's made of...that... I just don't feel like...
E_F1_Main14_23,"Oh, come on."
E_F1_Main14_24,Let's try it before we present it to the customers.
E_F1_Main14_25,Here!
E_F1_Main14_26,Heeere!
E_F1_Main14_27,Heeeeeere!
E_F1_Main14_28,...
E_F1_Main14_29,Ahhhhh! I can't! I just can't!
E_F1_Main14_30,Monster food is just too much for me!
E_F1_Main14_31,...I don't get it... It tastes so good...
E_Thousand_Stockade_01,"So it’s been 1,000 days already."
E_Thousand_Stockade_02,You’ve done a great job taking care of these dirtbags so far.
E_Thousand_Stockade_03,"Here, this is my token of gratitude for sorting out the trash."
E_Thousand_Stockade_04,"Don’t worry, it’s not a book."
E_Thousand_NormalShop_01,Welcome to May’s General Shop!
E_Thousand_NormalShop_02,"To celebrate the 1,000 days anniversary, I would like to sell this! But! I will give it to you for free! Only for you!"
E_Thousand_NormalShop_03,Please come visit May's General Shop often!
E_Thousand_Arena_01,"Wow! It's 1,000 days already?!"
E_Thousand_Arena_02,"You do know that I think very highly of you as a Hero, right?"
E_Thousand_Arena_03,But... I can’t just give you my products for free. Hahaha!
E_Thousand_Inn_01,"Wow, the inn is really crowded today. Perhaps it’s because today is 1,000 days."
E_Thousand_Inn_02,"Tee hee. Here, take this. This is my special gift, just for you."
E_Thousand_Inn_03,Please come and visit my inn again!
E_Thousand_Guild_01,"Oh my, I was so caught up with work that I forgot today is 1,000 days."
E_Thousand_Guild_02,I almost forgot to give you this.
E_Thousand_Guild_03,The guild is always open to you. Come back anytime.
E_Thousand_Royal_01,Welcome. I’ve been waiting for you.
E_Thousand_Royal_02,"So I see that it’s 1,000 days today."
E_Thousand_Royal_03,You’ve done a tremendous job helping the Royal palace so far.
E_Thousand_Blacksmith_01,"It's been 1,000 days already?! Hohaha!"
E_Thousand_Blacksmith_02,"You are going to need this. Here, take it!"
E_Thousand_Blacksmith_03,I will be seeing you again.
E_Thousand_Nicky_01_01,I knew you would come.
E_Thousand_Nicky_01_02,You won’t want to take a step forward because you are going to have so much fun playing with me.
E_Thousand_Nicky_01_03,You will meet him only when I'm completely exhausted.
E_Thousand_Nicky_01_04,You better be prepared. I like to play rough.
E_Thousand_Nicky_02_01,I’ve not had this much fun in so long.
E_Thousand_Nicky_02_02,Your skill is quite formidable... As expected of someone who got rid of the filthy trash.
E_Thousand_Nicky_02_03,Go. Go and see him.
E_Thousand_May_01_01,"Oh, hello, dear customer! I’ve been waiting for you!"
E_Thousand_May_01_02,"It’s time for a 1,000 days anniversary party! Come have a great time with May!"
E_Thousand_May_01_03,Just with me!
E_Thousand_May_01_04,You will not be playing with him!
E_Thousand_May_02_01,Waaa! You are too much for me to play with you alone!
E_Thousand_May_02_02,I will leave the rest of the party to him.
E_Thousand_Gladi_01_01,So you’ve come this far! You truly are talented!
E_Thousand_Gladi_01_02,"You will need to try harder if you want to face him, though. Hahaha!"
E_Thousand_Gladi_01_03,Been a while since I’ve seen some action. Let's do this!
E_Thousand_Gladi_02_01,Huzzah! That was a good warm up.
E_Thousand_Gladi_02_02,You should now go face him.
E_Thousand_Juno_01_01,"Oh, you're here!"
E_Thousand_Juno_01_02,"I’ve come to give special dishes to all Heroes to celebrate the 1,000 days anniversary."
E_Thousand_Juno_01_03,"But for you, since he asked me so nicely, I will give you about 100 plates."
E_Thousand_Juno_01_04,"I've spent a long, long time making these dishes. You are not going anywhere until you eat them all!"
E_Thousand_Juno_02_01,"Oh my, you ate everything..."
E_Thousand_Juno_02_02,"Now that you are full, you should go and visit him!"
E_Thousand_Veronica_01_01,I have been waiting for you.
E_Thousand_Veronica_01_02,"I still have a lot of work to do for the guild, but I just couldn't pass the 1,000 days anniversary."
E_Thousand_Veronica_01_03,"As requested from the one himself,"
E_Thousand_Veronica_01_04,I am in charge of writing a special guest participation report for this day.
E_Thousand_Veronica_02_01,Would you look at this list... It's ridiculously long.
E_Thousand_Veronica_02_02,"I did expect it to be crowded, though. Today is the 1,000 days anniversary, after all."
E_Thousand_Veronica_02_03,"Phew... Still busy, even at a party."
E_Thousand_Veronica_02_04,"If you get to see him, please send my regards."
E_Thousand_Loman_01_01,"I’m not supposed to leave my post,"
E_Thousand_Loman_01_02,but I got a special permit to go outside today.
E_Thousand_Loman_01_03,"I received his request to greet you on this 1,000 days anniversary."
E_Thousand_Loman_02_01,Your skills are truly exceptional.
E_Thousand_Loman_02_02,No wonder why he requested me personally to greet you.
E_Thousand_Loman_02_03,Go now. He is waiting for you.
E_Thousand_Jin_01_01,"Haha, so we meet again!"
E_Thousand_Jin_01_02,"Great job making it all the way here! Now that you are here, allow me to entertain you with a special blacksmith-style hammer show!"
E_Thousand_Jin_01_03,"You will never see this show in any other place but here, at this special party! Hohaha!"
E_Thousand_Jin_01_04,I will show you my fine skills from the Forge! It’s hammer time!
E_Thousand_Jin_02_01,"Hohoho. 1,000 days, aye?"
E_Thousand_Jin_02_02,It’s not a short time. Not at all.
E_Thousand_Jin_02_03,We know very well about your achievements and your heroic deeds.
E_Thousand_Jin_02_04,It’s all thanks to you that our world could move one step forward!
E_Thousand_Jin_02_05,"I know you yourself know this more than we do,"
E_Thousand_Jin_02_06,but you are the greatest Hero! Hahaha!
E_Thousand_Jin_02_07,"I’m sure you had many hardships and obstacles to overcome for 1,000 days."
E_Thousand_Jin_02_08,You’ve done so well. I sincerely appreciate your efforts.
E_Thousand_Jin_02_09,Your footsteps are the very reason why this world is so bright and brimming with life.
E_Thousand_Jin_02_10,We all know that by heart!
E_Thousand_Jin_02_11,Please remember that I will always be rooting for you!
E_Thousand_Jin_02_12,"Now then, move forth and continue in your quest to make this world a brighter place! And stay safe!"
E_Thousand_Jin_02_13,"Oh, and one more thing... I... Uh... Your Gear... I apologize for breaking many of your Gear..."
E_Thousand_Jin_02_14,I have no excuse for that.
E_Thousand_Jin_02_15,"Dear Raiders, we could celebrate this day because of you."
E_Thousand_Jin_02_16,We thank you once again.
E_TT1_Main1_1,"Ah, Your Highness. What brings you to my humble store?"
E_TT1_Main1_2,"If you would like to order a new dress, I can visit you at the pala-"
E_TT1_Main1_3,"Hahaha, it’s alright, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main1_4,I’m not here for a new dress today. I would like to request something else.
E_TT1_Main1_5,"Hmm... It must be important, then."
E_TT1_Main1_6,"I’m not sure how helpful I will be, but I will aid you as best as I can."
E_TT1_Main1_7,"As you know, the Demons have been attacking more and more fiercely these days."
E_TT1_Main1_8,"Not only that, the number of wandering Demons is increasing greatly as well."
E_TT1_Main1_9,I have a feeling that the time will come when all the nations will have to unite strengths to fight against the Demons.
E_TT1_Main1_10,"That said, I was planning to send envoys to both the Vespian Empire and the Kingdom of Orvelia..."
E_TT1_Main1_11,"But as of right now, I lack the knowledge of the current state of affairs for both nations."
E_TT1_Main1_12,"Yuria, you visited those two nations not too long ago. I would like to seek your advice regarding this matter."
E_TT1_Main1_13,"Ahh, I see... Perhaps I can be helpful for this one, yes."
E_TT1_Main1_14,Well then... Where should I start?
E_TT1_Main2_1,"Welcome, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main2_2,"It is an honor to have someone so famous as yourself, create my very own clothing."
E_TT1_Main2_3,"Fufu, the honor is mine, my lady."
E_TT1_Main2_4,You gave me the honor of seeing your fate as someone beloved by Mana itself.
E_TT1_Main2_5,Nothing is more inspiring to an artist’s soul than this.
E_TT1_Main2_6,"*Ahem* Forgive my intrusion, my lady."
E_TT1_Main2_7,A messenger pigeon from the Tower of Sage has arrived bearing urgent news.
E_TT1_Main2_8,It says that monsters have suddenly appeared across all of Orvelia.
E_TT1_Main2_9,"Furthermore, it detailed that usually the royal army and local armies deal with this kind of problem,"
E_TT1_Main2_10,"but apparently, high-level mind-corrupting magic has been detected from the monsters."
E_TT1_Main2_11,"To investigate the situation and mitigate the damage,"
E_TT1_Main2_12,Princess Scarlet herself has requested the cooperation of the Tower of Sage.
E_TT1_Main2_13,Why does it have to be today of all days?
E_TT1_Main2_14,"Priscilla, bring me my battle gear."
E_TT1_Main2_15,Who else is helping from the Tower of Sage?
E_TT1_Main2_16,The one with the title of Blue and Green are already participating in the battle.
E_TT1_Main2_17,It seems the two of them were staying in Orvel for personal business.
E_TT1_Main2_18,Blue? But I thought she hated being involved with the Tower of Sage.
E_TT1_Main2_19,"Yet, she doesn't seem to back out from these kinds of missions."
E_TT1_Main2_20,"Green was always interested in anything related to darkness, so I'm not surprised..."
E_TT1_Main2_21,"Um... Yuria, I’m sorry I have to say this, but..."
E_TT1_Main2_22,Can I delay the tailoring to tomorrow?
E_TT1_Main2_23,"You've used your precious time to come here, and I appreciate it, but..."
E_TT1_Main2_24,"As a noble, I must attend to my duties..."
E_TT1_Main2_25,"Fufufu, this is actually better."
E_TT1_Main2_26,Fate that shines in the fray and hardship is a source of great inspiration.
E_TT1_Main2_27,"That said, I would like to accompany the two of you."
E_TT1_Main2_28,...Are you certain about this?
E_TT1_Main2_29,We are going to run into a massive horde of monsters. It’s going to be dangerous.
E_TT1_Main2_30,"Oh, don't you worry about me."
E_TT1_Main2_31,I’m capable of protecting myself in such situations.
E_TT1_Main2_32,...
E_TT1_Main2_33,"*Chuckles* Don’t you worry, Lady Aisha. This isn’t the first time for me."
E_TT1_Main2_34,"So don’t mind me. Please just be yourself, as per usual."
E_TT1_Main2_35,I’m sure our fate will guide us.
E_TT1_Main2_36,...As usual?
E_TT1_Main2_37,Yes. Pretend I’m not there.
E_TT1_Main2_38,I shall stay back and watch until fate whispers to me.
E_TT1_Main2_39,...
E_TT1_Main3_1,"Whew... Great work, Priscilla."
E_TT1_Main3_2,"Thank you, my lady."
E_TT1_Main3_3,Shall we take a short break before venturing forth?
E_TT1_Main3_4,I prepared some tea beforehand since I figured we wouldn't have enough time for a proper setup.
E_TT1_Main3_5,Today’s tea is Windhaven Tea from Elidora.
E_TT1_Main3_6,"Ahh, that’s what Master Dominix regularly had."
E_TT1_Main3_7,I guess he’s still close with the Grand Elidoran Sage.
E_TT1_Main3_8,This tea is an extremely rare item...
E_TT1_Main3_9,Master Dominix sent a box each for you and Lady Cleo.
E_TT1_Main3_10,He wrote that he can't drink that much tea all by himself...
E_TT1_Main3_11,I wonder how that red rascal is doing.
E_TT1_Main3_12,"Tsk, reminds me of all the dresses she burned..."
E_TT1_Main3_13,...
E_TT1_Main3_14,"Please have some tea, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main3_15,"Wow, thank you."
E_TT1_Main3_16,"Hmm... Would you like a new piece of clothing too, Priscilla?"
E_TT1_Main3_17,Your style is very nice. I would like to make you a piece that suits you.
E_TT1_Main3_18,"Haha, thank you for the offer, but I’m okay."
E_TT1_Main3_19,My wardrobe is already filled with all the clothing that Lady Aisha gave me.
E_TT1_Main3_20,But thank you again for the offer. I really appreciate it.
E_TT1_Main3_21,"Hmm... Perhaps next time, then."
E_TT1_Main3_22,"By the way, you two seem to be in really good terms."
E_TT1_Main3_23,It makes me happy just by seeing you together.
E_TT1_Main3_24,I was with Priscilla ever since I was young.
E_TT1_Main3_25,She's basically my family.
E_TT1_Main3_26,...
E_TT1_Main3_27,"Now then, shall we get moving?"
E_TT1_Main3_28,I think we’ve had enough rest.
E_TT1_Main4_1,Ha!
E_TT1_Main4_2,"Now, my lady!"
E_TT1_Main4_3,Hyaaaa!
E_TT1_Main4_4,...There are more monsters than I expected.
E_TT1_Main4_5,"Stay by my side at all times, my lady."
E_TT1_Main4_6,"Of course, Priscilla."
E_TT1_Main4_7,??
E_TT1_Main4_8,"Wait, Priscilla... Where did all the monsters go? I thought there were more."
E_TT1_Main4_9,Ah...
E_TT1_Main4_10,"My lady, over there."
E_TT1_Main4_12,So she has such ability on top of her great reputation as a tailor...
E_TT1_Main4_13,This world really is filled with wonder.
E_TT1_Main4_14,Don't you worry about me.
E_TT1_Main4_15,My thread woven with starlight cannot be cut so easily.
E_TT1_Main4_16,"So, I think I’d love to see you two take down more monsters together."
E_TT1_Main4_17,Just the sight of your battle is drawing something powerful from deep within my heart.
E_TT1_Main4_18,It's so inspiring!!
E_TT1_Main4_19,...
E_TT1_Main4_20,Artists are really rather odd...
E_TT1_Main5_1,"Priscilla, I don't think I feel Dark Mana around here anymore."
E_TT1_Main5_2,I think we're done here.
E_TT1_Main5_3,"Ah, right on time. A message from the Tower of Sage has just arrived."
E_TT1_Main5_4,Looks like the monsters in other regions have been eliminated as well.
E_TT1_Main5_5,Wait... It says the northern territories took quite a severe damage.
E_TT1_Main5_6,One of the roads that were being guarded by private soldiers was breached by the monsters. The monsters then proceeded to wipe out a whole village...
E_TT1_Main5_7,North? That’s... El Moriham’s fief!!
E_TT1_Main5_8,...
E_TT1_Main5_9,...My lady.
E_TT1_Main5_10,"...Don't worry, Priscilla. I’m alright."
E_TT1_Main5_11,"Tsk, what’s that creepy geezer up to this time?!"
E_TT1_Main5_12,"My lady, please watch your language."
E_TT1_Main5_13,"Okay, okay!"
E_TT1_Main5_14,Ugh.
E_TT1_Main5_15,Just thinking about that sly prime minister makes me wanna throw up.
E_TT1_Main5_16,"Whenever the princess tries to do something good, he tries to interfere."
E_TT1_Main5_17,A dirtbag like that would discard his people like that.
E_TT1_Main5_18,"My lady, I understand your anger,"
E_TT1_Main5_19,but you shouldn’t lower your worth by saying such things.
E_TT1_Main5_20,Frowning will only ruin your beautiful face.
E_TT1_Main5_21,Tsk...
E_TT1_Main5_22,!!
E_TT1_Main5_23,"...Fufu, I'm getting a tingling feeling."
E_TT1_Main5_24,Let us begin.
E_TT1_Main5_25,"Wahh?? W-what are you doing, Yuria?"
E_TT1_Main5_26,Hehehe... Hue hue hue...
E_TT1_Main5_27,"Alright, please stay still."
E_TT1_Main5_28,I just felt fate's presence.
E_TT1_Main5_29,I can now make the best dress for lady Aisha!
E_TT1_Main5_30,The next day...
E_TT1_Main5_31,Fufufu... It is done.
E_TT1_Main5_32,You are a graceful rose that hides sharp thorns beneath your beauty.
E_TT1_Main5_33,Your bond with the one whom you trust is unbreakable. You love her like she is your family.
E_TT1_Main5_34,Your heart is strong enough to smoothly ride the wind of the cruel fate that you will face.
E_TT1_Main5_35,You are like a butterfly that spreads its purple wings.
E_TT1_Main5_36,"Behold... My magnum opus, only for you."
E_TT1_Main5_37,...This... really is impressive.
E_TT1_Main5_38,To think that you made this in just a day...
E_TT1_Main5_39,Other tailors took days to make a dress...
E_TT1_Main5_40,"With the right design and the right materials, it doesn't take too long."
E_TT1_Main5_41,The most time-consuming process for me is waiting for the right inspiration to enter my mind.
E_TT1_Main5_42,"It suits you perfectly, my lady."
E_TT1_Main5_43,...
E_TT1_Main5_44,"Thank you, Priscilla."
E_TT1_Main5_45,"Yuria, I cannot thank you enough."
E_TT1_Main5_46,I will reward you handsomely for this.
E_TT1_Main5_47,"Fufu, the pleasure is mine."
E_TT1_Main5_48,"Now then, it’s time for me to move on to my next client."
E_TT1_Main5_49,"Actually, can I ask you to guide me to Orvel Castle, Lady Aisha?"
E_TT1_Main5_50,I have an appointment with Princess Scarlet.
E_TT1_Main6_1,"My, my. Your Highness! It's been so long."
E_TT1_Main6_2,You've grown so beautiful ever since I last saw you.
E_TT1_Main6_3,I can’t wait to see who you will grow into...
E_TT1_Main6_4,"...It’s been only 4 years, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main6_5,Aren't you exaggerating a bit too much?
E_TT1_Main6_6,But this is new.
E_TT1_Main6_7,I remember Her Royal Highness not being a big fan of dressing up...
E_TT1_Main6_8,I'm guessing Your Highness is no longer like that?
E_TT1_Main6_9,Ahem.
E_TT1_Main6_10,"Ahahaha, it is true that Her Royal Highness doesn't take much interest in dressing- Ow."
E_TT1_Main6_11,?? Dress up is important?
E_TT1_Main6_12,Ahem... I will get straight to the point.
E_TT1_Main6_13,Harvesting ceremonies will soon take place across all of Orvelia.
E_TT1_Main6_14,"Usually, His Majesty gives his celebration speech, but he has fallen ill."
E_TT1_Main6_15,"Hence, for this year, Her Royal Highness, Princess Scarlet, will give the opening address of the festival."
E_TT1_Main6_16,We’ve contacted you because we need a new dress for Her Highness to wear for her speech.
E_TT1_Main6_17,"Hmm, I see..."
E_TT1_Main6_18,A dress that shows princess Scarlet's true quality to all of Orvelia...
E_TT1_Main6_19,"Ah, I have a perfect scenario for that."
E_TT1_Main6_20,Pardon? Scenario?
E_TT1_Main6_21,"Yes. Princess Scarlet, the strong and brave..."
E_TT1_Main6_22,But inside that display of strength lies a sublime heart...
E_TT1_Main6_23,We need both her external and her internal qualities to make the dress of fate.
E_TT1_Main6_24,???
E_TT1_Main6_25,"Um, Priscilla..."
E_TT1_Main6_26,Why is Her Highness making such a face?
E_TT1_Main6_27,Actually...
E_TT1_Main6_28,"I heard that when Yuria was summoned four years ago to make Her Highness’ clothing,"
E_TT1_Main6_29,"she demanded Her Highness to act out various skits, each with a certain scenario."
E_TT1_Main6_30,I also heard Captain Demia got dragged into it quite a lot...
E_TT1_Main6_31,...Artists are so odd.
E_TT1_Main6_32,It’s like they have their own world...
E_TT1_Main6_33,I have no idea how their minds work.
E_TT1_Main6_34,Fufufu... Your Highness...
E_TT1_Main6_35,"I need you to spar with Captain Demia, Sir Clause, and Sir Chase."
E_TT1_Main6_36,"..Demia, is this really okay?"
E_TT1_Main6_37,"...We both know from experience that we have no choice, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main6_38,"I pray for this to end quickly, unlike 4 years ago."
E_TT1_Main6_39,"Brace yourself, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main6_40,"Hahaha... Please go easy on us, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main6_41,...We fight the princess?
E_TT1_Main6_42,I thought we protect.
E_TT1_Main6_43,"Don’t think too hard, Chase."
E_TT1_Main6_44,This is just a sparring session.
E_TT1_Main6_45,...
E_TT1_Main7_1,*Huff... Huff... Huff...*
E_TT1_Main7_2,"Are you alright, Your Highness?"
E_TT1_Main7_3,Fighting against 3 people at once is no easy task...
E_TT1_Main7_4,Princess... You look exhausted. You should rest...
E_TT1_Main7_5,I’m... alright. *Pant...*
E_TT1_Main7_6,I just need to gather my breath...
E_TT1_Main7_8,"Oh, you can stop now, hehe. That should do."
E_TT1_Main7_9,"You are strong, yet soft."
E_TT1_Main7_10,"You are colorful, yet harmonious."
E_TT1_Main7_11,Your glorious fate...
E_TT1_Main7_12,I have seen everything I need.
E_TT1_Main7_13,"Now then, it’s time to work."
E_TT1_Main7_14,The next day...
E_TT1_Main7_15,"How do you like your dress, Your Highness?"
E_TT1_Main7_16,"As a bonus, I’ve enchanted it with a spell. I learned it from a visitor that came from a mystical nation to the east."
E_TT1_Main7_17,"If the wind runs pass your dress, it will spread a pleasant fragrance of flowers and surround you with petals."
E_TT1_Main7_18,Wow...
E_TT1_Main7_19,...Whoa...
E_TT1_Main7_20,Ahem.
E_TT1_Main7_21,Just imagine Her Highness marching out to the event with that dress on.
E_TT1_Main7_22,I’m sure all the noblemen would line up to propo-
E_TT1_Main7_23,Ahem!! That's enough.
E_TT1_Main7_24,"Marriage, betrothal... Such things don't interest me at the moment."
E_TT1_Main7_25,"Haha, is there a shortage of good men, Your Highness?"
E_TT1_Main7_26,"There are many reasons,"
E_TT1_Main7_27,but let’s just say it’s not the right time for that. Orvel is in chaos at the moment.
E_TT1_Main7_28,"I am trying my best to make Orvelia strong with the help from Demia and other good nobles,"
E_TT1_Main7_29,"but it’s been hard because we have to deal with opportunists like El Moriham, who are trying to take advantage of His Majesty’s illness and rise to power."
E_TT1_Main7_30,"Hmm... It must be hard for you, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main7_31,But worry not.
E_TT1_Main7_32,I will not deny that the path ahead of you is rocky and full of hardships...
E_TT1_Main7_33,"I strongly believe that with Your Highness, Orvel is in good hands."
E_TT1_Main7_34,...
E_TT1_Main7_35,"Ooh, that’s the face I'd like you to make, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main7_36,Smile with that face in front of your people. They will also respond with a happy smile.
E_TT1_Main7_37,"Smile, and the people will smile with you."
E_TT1_Main7_38,"Now then, I will take my leave for my next appointment."
E_TT1_Main7_39,"Forgive me for leaving in such a hurry, Your Highness. The Vespian Empire is quite far from here, so..."
E_TT1_Main7_40,"Thank you all for welcoming me. I will see you again in the future, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main7_41,"...It’s been 4 years, yet she hasn’t changed one bit."
E_TT1_Main7_42,"...She is still hard to follow, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main7_43,"However, her skills and insight are still unmatched."
E_TT1_Main7_44,"Stay strong, Your Highness."
E_TT1_Main7_45,"Smile, and the people will smile with you."
E_TT1_Main7_46,"The princess must smile. Only then, others can all smile."
E_TT1_Main7_47,...Yes. I have to stay strong.
E_TT1_Main8_1,"Hmm, I see."
E_TT1_Main8_2,"So the King of Orvelia lies in his bed, stricken with an illness..."
E_TT1_Main8_3,"The nobles are feuding with each other for more power,"
E_TT1_Main8_4,and in the center stands Prime Minister El Moriham...
E_TT1_Main8_5,Poor princess Scarlet. She must have a lot on her shoulders.
E_TT1_Main8_6,I should give her a word of encouragement when I see her next time.
E_TT1_Main8_7,...So you went to the Empire after seeing the princess.
E_TT1_Main8_8,What was the situation there?
E_TT1_Main8_9,"Hmm, a lot of things happened while I was there. First..."
E_TT1_Main8_10,"Well, this is unfortunate."
E_TT1_Main8_11,The roads of the Empire are just too complicated.
E_TT1_Main8_12,"According to the map Sir Fluss gave me, Commander Chrisha’s office should be here..."
E_TT1_Main8_13,"Oh, my."
E_TT1_Main8_14,Hyaaa!!!
E_TT1_Main8_15,"Ancestors, please lend us your strength!"
E_TT1_Main8_16,Kwaaaakkk!
E_TT1_Main8_17,"Help us, capt- Ahhhh!!"
E_TT1_Main8_18,"Tsk, useless piece of trash!"
E_TT1_Main8_19,"If you are incompetent, then at least do your job as a meat shield properly!"
E_TT1_Main8_20,I am an honorable officer of the glorious Vespian Empire!
E_TT1_Main8_21,You should be honored to give up your life for me!!
E_TT1_Main8_22,"Honorable officer? Yeah, right!"
E_TT1_Main8_23,You are just a corrupt official who abuses the people of the claimed territories to feed yourself!
E_TT1_Main8_24,It was the right choice to wait here and ambush you. The informant was right!
E_TT1_Main8_25,You are just a stray vigilante who sides with a terrorist organization! You have no right to say that!
E_TT1_Main8_26,The Resistance is not a terrorist organization.
E_TT1_Main8_27,They are ones who fight hard to create a future where the people of this land can live without fear.
E_TT1_Main8_28,"Ha, what does a barbaric denizen of the lake know?!"
E_TT1_Main8_29,"Well, what are you all waiting for?! Get them!!"
E_TT1_Main8_30,(Hmm... I did not expect to come across this.
E_TT1_Main8_31,...Interesting though. I see that they have a rather peculiar thread of destiny...
E_TT1_Main8_32,"Let’s see... I have plenty of time, and I’m lost. I can afford to see how this turns out...)"
E_TT1_Main9_1,"Ugh, there are too many of them!!"
E_TT1_Main9_2,Stop hiding behind your men and come out!!
E_TT1_Main9_3,"Don't let the fires of emotion get you, Cecilia."
E_TT1_Main9_4,Stay patient. The way will eventually open.
E_TT1_Main9_5,But!!
E_TT1_Main9_6,Ahahahaha! How do you like that?!
E_TT1_Main9_7,This is the power of the Empire!
E_TT1_Main9_8,You are just a bunch of ants beneath our feet!
E_TT1_Main9_9,"All troops, charge!!!"
E_TT1_Main9_10,"Catch them alive, and you will be handsomely rewarded!!"
E_TT1_Main9_11,Now!
E_TT1_Main9_12,"O’ great king, rain down judgment upon them with thine sword!"
E_TT1_Main9_13,Hyaaa!!!
E_TT1_Main9_14,Special Move—Meteor Kick!!!
E_TT1_Main9_15,Kwaaaak!!!
E_TT1_Main9_16,I got you now!
E_TT1_Main9_17,Now how should I punish you...
E_TT1_Main9_18,"Since he is so corrupt,"
E_TT1_Main9_19,he will just use his connection to get out of the cell quickly if we just hand him over to the guards...
E_TT1_Main9_20,I have a plan.
E_TT1_Main9_21,"Among the Empire’s inquisitor, there’s someone named Chrisha."
E_TT1_Main9_22,She is famous for being fair and just. I believe we should let her take care of him.
E_TT1_Main9_23,!!!!
E_TT1_Main9_24,N-not her!!
E_TT1_Main9_25,"Wow, he's really scared. That nails it."
E_TT1_Main9_26,"Okay then, let’s take him to that inquisitor called Chri- Wha?!"
E_TT1_Main9_27,"He's running away, Cecilia!!"
E_TT1_Main9_28,I will take care of them here.
E_TT1_Main9_29,Chase him!
E_TT1_Main9_30,"Dammit, I thought he wouldn’t be able to get up..."
E_TT1_Main9_31,Stop right there!
E_TT1_Main10_1,*Huff... Huff... Huff...*
E_TT1_Main10_2,"Good, I don't see anyone chasing me..."
E_TT1_Main10_3,"Ugh, just you wait and see, Resistance scums... Someday, I will come and get you- huh?"
E_TT1_Main10_4,...
E_TT1_Main10_5,"Move aside, woman! Outta my way!!"
E_TT1_Main10_6,"Oh, gosh, are you pointing your gun at me?"
E_TT1_Main10_7,"Hmm, looks like I’m in trouble..."
E_TT1_Main10_8,Stop talking to yourself!
E_TT1_Main10_9,"You are from the Resistance too, aren’t you?!"
E_TT1_Main10_10,Hmm? I don't know what you are talking about. What’s a Resistance?
E_TT1_Main10_11,I’m just a traveler who likes making clothes.
E_TT1_Main10_12,...Is that so? I see...
E_TT1_Main10_13,Then I’m gonna use you as a hostage to get out of this situation!
E_TT1_Main10_14,Don’t you resist!
E_TT1_Main10_15,Hehe... Hehahaha! Now I have an innocent person as my hostage.
E_TT1_Main10_16,Those Resistance scums wouldn't dare attack me.
E_TT1_Main10_17,"Oh, a hostage situation? I've never tried that before. Maybe it will be fun."
E_TT1_Main10_18,...What?
E_TT1_Main10_19,But I’m afraid... I have a schedule...
E_TT1_Main10_20,Fufu.
E_TT1_Main10_21,!!!!
E_TT1_Main10_22,*Groan*
E_TT1_Main10_23,I hope it’s not too tight.
E_TT1_Main10_24,I need you to stay that way for a while.
E_TT1_Main10_25,My guides are on their way...
E_TT1_Main10_26,"Ugh, he’s so fast with his feet!"
E_TT1_Main10_27,Why are all the villains so quick- what the?
E_TT1_Main10_28,"Um... Sorry, but who are you?"
E_TT1_Main10_29,You don’t look like one of us...
E_TT1_Main10_30,"Fufu, nice to meet you."
E_TT1_Main10_31,I see that you carry a light bright like the sun.
E_TT1_Main10_32,I can't help but be impressed with your righteous soul! I just want to make you a dress right now!
E_TT1_Main10_33,Eh? Wha?
E_TT1_Main10_34,"But, unfortunately, I have somewhere to go..."
E_TT1_Main10_35,"Do you, by any chance, know where the office of Inquisitor Chrisha is?"
E_TT1_Main10_36,I’m afraid I’m lost...
E_TT1_Main10_37,Um...
E_TT1_Main10_38,"(Argh, whatever.)"
E_TT1_Main10_39,"Well, since we were planning to take Mr. Scumbag over there to Chrisha..."
E_TT1_Main10_40,You can just follow me.
E_TT1_Main10_41,"Oh, thank you."
E_TT1_Main10_42,Please lead the way then.
E_TT1_Main10_43,(...Just who is this woman?!)
E_TT1_Main11_1,"Welcome to the Empire, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main11_2,You must’ve come a long way.
E_TT1_Main11_3,To think that you lost your way in the Empire-Resistance conflict zone...
E_TT1_Main11_4,This is my mistake.
E_TT1_Main11_5,I will have the soldiers escort you next time you visit.
E_TT1_Main11_6,"Fufufu, don't worry about it."
E_TT1_Main11_7,"Other than the tied up officer at the gate,"
E_TT1_Main11_8,there was no one who threatened me.
E_TT1_Main11_9,...What the Resistance is doing is clearly against the emperor’s will...
E_TT1_Main11_10,But sometimes they do good things for the Empire like this one... It feels weird.
E_TT1_Main11_11,"Well, thanks to them, I have more data on how corrupted the military is."
E_TT1_Main11_12,"*Chuckles*, they are renegades that’s for sure, but they feel rather like heroes that protect justice right now."
E_TT1_Main11_13,...I will pretend I did not hear that. You could get into trouble for that.
E_TT1_Main11_14,"Since the Resistance's influence isn't significant here in the capital,"
E_TT1_Main11_15,they haven't caused much trouble so far...
E_TT1_Main11_16,But they are expanding their forces for sure.
E_TT1_Main11_17,The time will come when we have to fight them.
E_TT1_Main11_18,I have plans for that too. Don’t think too deeply about it.
E_TT1_Main11_19,"Now, now, let’s stop talking about serious stuff."
E_TT1_Main11_20,It’s rather rude to keep our lovely lady waiting...
E_TT1_Main11_21,We requested for you here because of the royal masquerade.
E_TT1_Main11_22,Chrisha here has never been to a masquerade before.
E_TT1_Main11_23,"So I thought, why not introduce her to you and commission an outfit for her?"
E_TT1_Main11_24,Hm...
E_TT1_Main11_25,Let’s see...
E_TT1_Main11_26,...
E_TT1_Main11_27,We are required to wear an outfit that looks as if it was designed for an on-stage performance rather than formal party attire.
E_TT1_Main11_28,"I would like to ask you for an exceptional costume that no one dared to think of, just like last year."
E_TT1_Main11_29,"Oh, that sounds like a very interesting theme."
E_TT1_Main11_30,Hmm... How should I depict your fate?
E_TT1_Main11_31,This is going to be fun!
E_TT1_Main11_32,??
E_TT1_Main11_33,Fate?
E_TT1_Main11_34,"Let's begin immediately, shall we?"
E_TT1_Main11_35,"Commander Chrisha, please stand right here."
E_TT1_Main11_36,"As for Sir Fluss, I need you to be there."
E_TT1_Main11_37,Good. Now I need you both to meditate.
E_TT1_Main11_38,I want you to imagine how you would look on stage.
E_TT1_Main11_39,You could look graceful. Or you could look quite scary. Maybe you could be enjoying the stage!
E_TT1_Main11_40,Anything. I need you to act in your mind. Take as many roles as you can. Find out what you are most comfortable with.
E_TT1_Main11_41,...What a bizarre production method.
E_TT1_Main11_42,"Heh, I know, right? Just trust me on this. Her skills are superior."
E_TT1_Main12_1,The next day
E_TT1_Main12_2,This... is a pirate costume.
E_TT1_Main12_3,Looks like my theme is a swordsman from the East.
E_TT1_Main12_4,"Haha, Commander Chrisha, it is your destiny to pave a path for a new future."
E_TT1_Main12_5,"Pirates are usually associated with the image of evil marauders,"
E_TT1_Main12_6,"but among the pirates, there were the ones who chart a new course and find untamed lands."
E_TT1_Main12_7,No one would expect you to wear this. What do you think?
E_TT1_Main12_8,...I can already see my father’s surprised look.
E_TT1_Main12_9,Next is Sir Fluss.
E_TT1_Main12_10,The theme of your costume is a royal guard from the East.
E_TT1_Main12_11,"Sir Fluss, you are destined to protect the future and the people who open that future."
E_TT1_Main12_12,I feel that this theme fits you as you are an Imperial Knight yourself.
E_TT1_Main12_13,"Of course, people would be surprised to see you as most of them have never seen the attire of the East. Fufufu..."
E_TT1_Main12_14,"I know the people of the eastern nation and the Empire do trade sometimes, but that’s uncommon, isn’t it?"
E_TT1_Main12_15,"Yes, it’s been a while since their last ship arrived at our docks."
E_TT1_Main12_16,"Come to think of it, isn’t that swordsman of the Hound Unit from the East as well?"
E_TT1_Main12_17,I think I heard that he is a noble in the East.
E_TT1_Main12_18,"Ah, you mean Kibera?"
E_TT1_Main12_19,The news has it that he’s traveling alone after the dismissal of the Hound Unit.
E_TT1_Main12_20,"Since he is a part of the plan as well, I should send him a message soon."
E_TT1_Main12_21,Fufufu... Looks like my work is done here.
E_TT1_Main12_22,It’s fun to design a piece that follows a theme from time to time.
E_TT1_Main12_23,Just say the word if you need me again.
E_TT1_Main12_24,"Thank you, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main12_25,Are you returning to Penteonia now?
E_TT1_Main12_26,"Oh, yes."
E_TT1_Main12_27,"It was a fun journey, but quite long. I'm rather tired."
E_TT1_Main12_28,I also have to weave new starlight threads too.
E_TT1_Main12_29,I've heard news that there have been frequent sightings of wandering Demons in the demon territory near the borders of the Empire and Penteonia.
E_TT1_Main12_30,It is said that even high-ranking Demons make their appearance. I hired a bodyguard in the morning because of that.
E_TT1_Main12_31,"I know you are capable of protecting yourself,"
E_TT1_Main12_32,"but better safe than sorry, yes?"
E_TT1_Main12_33,"Don't you agree, Bernheim?"
E_TT1_Main12_34,...
E_TT1_Main12_35,"Yuria... of Penteonia, was it?"
E_TT1_Main12_36,...Fufu.
E_TT1_Main13_1,Bernheim von Lachelima...
E_TT1_Main13_2,I did hear that he was working as a mercenary in the Empire.
E_TT1_Main13_3,A novice knight who was exiled from the nation after touching the blade of sealed darkness.
E_TT1_Main13_4,I heard that he is an unholy knight whom the light abandoned.
E_TT1_Main13_5,...There’s still a massive mistrust against the power of darkness in Penteonia.
E_TT1_Main13_6,I still feel sad about not being able to stop him from being exiled...
E_TT1_Main13_7,"Ever since Bernheim’s departure, Marquis Lachelima has never spent a day without being worried."
E_TT1_Main13_8,I hope I can bring good news to him today.
E_TT1_Main13_9,"Thankfully, it seemed Bernheim did not abandon his learnings as a Knight of Penteonia."
E_TT1_Main13_10,It was thanks to him that I could arrive at Penteonia’s border safely.
E_TT1_Main13_11,...
E_TT1_Main13_12,You are awfully quiet.
E_TT1_Main13_13,"Hello, can you hear me?"
E_TT1_Main13_14,...What is it?
E_TT1_Main13_15,"I’ve been talking to you ever since the beginning, but I didn't hear a single answer from you."
E_TT1_Main13_16,"...I'm hired to protect you, not to talk with you."
E_TT1_Main13_17,Are we done? Then let’s get moving.
E_TT1_Main13_18,How cold. Are you like that with everyone?
E_TT1_Main13_19,Or is it because I’m a Penteonian?
E_TT1_Main13_20,"I’ve heard much about you, Bernheim von Lachelima..."
E_TT1_Main13_21,"I don’t think you are a bad person, though."
E_TT1_Main13_22,...Halt.
E_TT1_Main13_23,??
E_TT1_Main13_24,Enemies.
E_TT1_Main13_25,Multiple Demons. Drifters.
E_TT1_Main13_26,Be careful.
E_TT1_Main14_1,*Roar*
E_TT1_Main14_2,*Screech*
E_TT1_Main14_3,What an incredible power.
E_TT1_Main14_4,You sent enemies flying everywhere.
E_TT1_Main14_5,Kekekeke!
E_TT1_Main14_6,Right? Incredible indeed!!
E_TT1_Main14_7,I am the greatest!
E_TT1_Main14_8,"Ugh, Targarios, stop."
E_TT1_Main14_9,Hmm? I just heard a voice.
E_TT1_Main14_10,*Sigh*
E_TT1_Main14_11,You just don't listen.
E_TT1_Main14_12,I thought I told you to stay silent.
E_TT1_Main14_13,Why should I stay silent?!
E_TT1_Main14_14,"If yer a bodyguard, I’m a bodyguard!"
E_TT1_Main14_15,Don’t you worry. I won't do anything stupid. Kekekeke!!!
E_TT1_Main14_16,A demonic sword with a soul...
E_TT1_Main14_17,So this is the sword you took from the sanctum of the Central Church...
E_TT1_Main14_18,"Kahahaha! Indeed! I am that famous demonic sword, Targarios!"
E_TT1_Main14_19,"Hehaha, this fool is totally hopeless when it comes to the light element,"
E_TT1_Main14_20,but has great potential in the dark element.
E_TT1_Main14_21,I can't believe this fool is letting all that talent rot!
E_TT1_Main14_22,Idiot! Fool! Halfwit! Mouthbreather! Moron! Kehehe!!
E_TT1_Main14_23,*Sigh*
E_TT1_Main14_24,This is why I didn't talk.
E_TT1_Main14_25,"I know that whenever I talk, this nosy sword will-"
E_TT1_Main14_26,Are you really that stupid?
E_TT1_Main14_27,"Think about it. Even if you don’t say anything, if I just initiate the conversation anyway, the result is going to be the same!"
E_TT1_Main14_28,Blockhead! Simpleton! Dimwit! Air- AIEEE!
E_TT1_Main14_29,"Hehe, you two look really close."
E_TT1_Main14_30,Don’t let this fool you. This thing’s plan is to slowly corrupt me.
E_TT1_Main14_31,"I really want to dump this sword and be on my way,"
E_TT1_Main14_32,but all my attempts to do so failed.
E_TT1_Main14_33,*Sigh*
E_TT1_Main14_34,Ahahaha...
E_TT1_Main15_1,"May I ask you some questions, mister demonic sword?"
E_TT1_Main15_2,Huh? Questions?
E_TT1_Main15_3,"Kahahaha! Very well! Since I’m feeling real good today, I will answer all your questions!"
E_TT1_Main15_4,Ask away!
E_TT1_Main15_5,"Who are you, really? Or what were you?"
E_TT1_Main15_6,Hmmmm... I think... I was a Dark Lord in the past.
E_TT1_Main15_7,"I don't remember the details, but I was amazing!"
E_TT1_Main15_8,"Now, I’m locked up inside this damn sword. Phewy!"
E_TT1_Main15_9,So your power comes from...
E_TT1_Main15_10,"Oh, I can absorb all sorts of energy that exist in this world."
E_TT1_Main15_11,Divine power... Mana... You just name it. I can absorb all of them and make the power mine.
E_TT1_Main15_12,"Ah, but obviously, I want to avoid divine power."
E_TT1_Main15_13,"It feels gross, and it creeps me out."
E_TT1_Main15_14,This Bernheim here occasionally threatens to throw me into the Fountain of Holy Water.
E_TT1_Main15_15,What an idiot. All I have to do is not to consume the divine power and just stay put. Kehahaha!
E_TT1_Main15_16,Shh. I’m sensing movement again.
E_TT1_Main15_17,...This is strange.
E_TT1_Main15_18,"The drifter Demons from before, and now this..."
E_TT1_Main15_19,We are still in the Empire's domain. Why are there so many Demons?
E_TT1_Main15_20,"It would either mean that those Demons are launching a mass attack from the borders,"
E_TT1_Main15_21,or they were summoned nearby.
E_TT1_Main15_22,"Whatever, more for me."
E_TT1_Main15_23,Let’s just kill them all!
E_TT1_Main15_24,"Will you please shut up for 2 seconds, Targarios?"
E_TT1_Main15_25,"Yeah, yeah, whateverrr."
E_TT1_Main15_26,"There’s a high-ranking Demon over there,"
E_TT1_Main15_27,but I guess I’m just gonna shut up and do nothing.
E_TT1_Main15_28,*Sigh*
E_TT1_Main15_29,This isn't good.
E_TT1_Main15_30,I’m sure it brought the other Demons with it.
E_TT1_Main15_31,I've never seen a high-ranking Demon before.
E_TT1_Main15_32,Is it that powerful?
E_TT1_Main15_33,"I faced high-ranking Demons a couple of times in the past, and they were all extremely challenging opponents."
E_TT1_Main15_34,Each of the high-ranking Demons harnesses a different kind of power.
E_TT1_Main15_35,You can never let your guard down when fighting one.
E_TT1_Main15_36,"Come on, it's not that bad."
E_TT1_Main15_37,Just leave it to me!
E_TT1_Main15_38,I can just kill them all!
E_TT1_Main15_39,"No. Hide your energy, Targarios."
E_TT1_Main15_40,I’m going to wait for the opportunity to strike.
E_TT1_Main16_1,It can't be this easy.
E_TT1_Main16_2,This is strange...
E_TT1_Main16_3,I don't see any high-ranking Demon.
E_TT1_Main16_4,"Hey, check this out. Looks like these losers were all being controlled."
E_TT1_Main16_5,"With such power, controlling a human’s mind should be a piece of cake."
E_TT1_Main16_6,...I should get rid of it.
E_TT1_Main16_7,We’ve arrived at Penteonia. Our contract is over.
E_TT1_Main16_8,Get inside the Curtain of Light now.
E_TT1_Main16_9,"I'm find and take care of that high-ranking Demon, then go back to the Empire."
E_TT1_Main16_10,Boo. Just be honest.
E_TT1_Main16_11,"Just say that although you miss your home, since you can't return,"
E_TT1_Main16_12,you want to help by taking care of any possible threats nearby.
E_TT1_Main16_13,Although that won’t solve anything at all. Kekekeke!
E_TT1_Main16_14,...
E_TT1_Main16_15,"I did hear reports that a power of darkness appeared near the Curtain of Light,"
E_TT1_Main16_16,but it didn’t attack the curtain and vanished shortly.
E_TT1_Main16_17,That must’ve been Bernheim and the demonic sword.
E_TT1_Main16_18,His fate was quite twisted.
E_TT1_Main16_19,It felt like watching an endless maze.
E_TT1_Main16_20,It’s up to him to get consumed by the maze or consume the maze itself.
E_TT1_Main16_21,"...Sounds like you took a liking to him, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main16_22,His presence itself carried something that stimulates an artist's heart.
E_TT1_Main16_23,I would love to make him a special suit in the future.
E_TT1_Main16_24,...
E_TT1_Main16_25,"Nonetheless, I’m glad to hear that he's doing well."
E_TT1_Main16_26,I should tell Marquis Lachelima about this later.
E_TT1_Main16_27,"Thank you for telling me everything, Yuria."
E_TT1_Main16_28,"Fufufu... Anytime, My Queen."
E_TT1_Main16_29,"So when should I start making your new dress, Your Highness?"
E_TT1_Main16_30,You haven't really requested for my services lately.
E_TT1_Main16_31,"Ah... Um... Haha... That’s... Maybe, um, next time..."

E_C3_Main_0_17,Wish... box?
E_C3_Main_0_18,Lalala!
E_C3_Main_0_19,Hehe... Almost done.
E_C3_Main_0_20,"List of gifts I want to receive, checked. Coupons... checked."
E_C3_Main_0_21,And... What’s this? Doesn't look like the mongrel’s.
E_C3_Main_0_22,"Ah, whatever. I’m just gonna put it in the box too."

E_C3_Main_0_28,Go away!
E_C3_Main_0_29,Tsk-tsk...
E_C3_Main_0_30,Can't believe you're doing this rubbish as well.
E_C3_Main_0_31,It's just an event. Why is everyone so crazy about it?
E_C3_Main_0_32,"None of your business! You ain't getting nothing from me even if I win, stupid mongrel."
E_C3_Main_0_33,"Ha, as if I would take an interest in that kind of stuff."
E_C3_Main_0_34,But wow... Would you look at that... Just how many coupons do you have?
E_C3_Main_0_35,Hang on... Those post office crates that exploded... Were those your doing?
E_C3_Main_0_36,Th-that wasn’t me!
E_C3_Main_0_37,"Yeah, right."
E_C3_Main_0_38,You obviously burned the crates and stole them.
E_C3_Main_0_39,"Come to think of it, you’ve been wandering outside quite often. I should’ve known."
E_C3_Main_0_40,"Oh, shut it! What are you gonna do about it then, huh?!"
E_C3_Main_0_41,"Kekeke. When the old man comes back, I’m gonna tell him that you've been causing lotta trouble."
E_C3_Main_0_42,Whatever! Do it for all I care!
E_C3_Main_0_43,He’s not gonna do anything if I share some of the gifts with him.
E_C3_Main_0_44,"Sure, sure."
E_C3_Main_0_45,Just go away and leave me alone!
E_C3_Main_0_46,"?! Oh, I almost forgot!"
E_C3_Main_0_47,I didn’t bring the thing.
E_C3_Main_0_48,Don’t you touch anything while I’m gone!
E_C3_Main_0_49,I’m gonna burn your ugly butt if you do!
E_C3_Main_0_50,"Seriously, grow up. This is so childish."
E_C3_Main_0_51,Wish box? Ha! Hope you get a box full of poop. Kekeke

E_C3_Main_0_56,I’m from the post office.
E_C3_Main_0_57,Huh?
E_C3_Main_0_58,Yo!! Someone's at the door!
E_C3_Main_0_59,This is strange... Hmm... Where did it go?
E_C3_Main_0_60,?? I thought you called to deliver the wish box.
E_C3_Main_0_61,Please hurry.
E_C3_Main_0_62,Today is the last day to send Playing Playing event boxes to Orvel.
E_C3_Main_0_63,Uh...
E_C3_Main_0_64,"Hey, crazy!!!"
E_C3_Main_0_65,I’m sure I piled 'em up here...
E_C3_Main_0_66,HEYYY!! Are you listening?! What are you doing?!
E_C3_Main_0_67,"If you have nothing to send, then I will be leav-"
E_C3_Main_0_68,Huh??? W-wait up!
E_C3_Main_0_69,Ugh. I guess I'll just send all these here...
E_C3_Main_0_70,Coupons

E_C3_Main_0_72,???
E_C3_Main_0_73,Found ‘em!! My toys!
E_C3_Main_0_74,?
E_C3_Main_0_75,"Wait, where is everything?"
E_C3_Main_0_76,"Seriously, I called you so many times!"
E_C3_Main_0_77,"A person from the post office came by, so I just quickly wrapped everything and gave it all to ‘em."
E_C3_Main_0_78,...??
E_C3_Main_0_79,?? What’s that trash you are carrying?
E_C3_Main_0_80,*Door opens*
E_C3_Main_0_81,What a mess.
E_C3_Main_0_82,Old man?! You're back!
E_C3_Main_0_83,Mister!
E_C3_Main_0_84,Valance said she sent me a package while I was at the military command.
E_C3_Main_0_85,Looks like it hasn't arrived yet.
E_C3_Main_0_86,??
E_C3_Main_0_87,She said the package contains an item of great importance to me. Notify me immediately when you receive it.
E_C3_Main_0_88,????????????
E_C3_Main_0_89,It all started then..
E_C3_Main_0_90,When I tried to pull a prank on that crazy girl as I always have.
E_C3_Main_1_1_1,This wouldn’t have happened if you weren’t so obsessed with that dumb event!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_2,"UGH! This is all because of you, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_3,Stupid mongrel!!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_4,"Shut up, you little wretch!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_5,Ah... A package that Valance prepared for the old man...?
E_C3_Main_1_1_5_Plus_1,And it's of great importance to him? Then it must be...
E_C3_Main_1_1_5_Plus_2,Rose...
E_C3_Main_1_1_5_Plus_3,Shut up!
E_C3_Main_1_1_6,*Gulp*
E_C3_Main_1_1_7,"I-it could be something else, right?"
E_C3_Main_1_1_8,R-right! Something different!
E_C3_Main_1_1_9,A new weapon?
E_C3_Main_1_1_10,A toy?
E_C3_Main_1_1_11,A piece of clothing?
E_C3_Main_1_1_12,Socks?
E_C3_Main_1_1_13,Money?
E_C3_Main_1_1_14,AHHH!!! There's no way Valance would send something like that!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_15,It must be THAT! There’s nothing else!!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_16,Do you think he'll give us a spanking?
E_C3_Main_1_1_17,Pray it ends with just a spanking.
E_C3_Main_1_1_18,The old man’s weapon is going to turn into poo! He’ll kill us! I’m sure of it!
E_C3_Main_1_1_19,"Wait... We just need to lose the draw, though."
E_C3_Main_1_1_20,Shut up! Have you seen the number of coupons you're sending!?
E_C3_Main_1_1_21,"Hehe, that’s true."
E_C3_Main_1_1_22,It’s not funny! And this is NOT a compliment!
E_C3_Main_1_1_23,That’s our only ticket out of this.
E_C3_Main_1_1_24,A Santa sleigh?!
E_C3_Main_1_1_25,That looks fun!
E_C3_Main_1_1_26,"Hey, we are not going on a vacation. Don't be so excited."
E_C3_Main_1_1_27,"Also, that’s not an ordinary sleigh. It’s called a thruster."
E_C3_Main_1_1_28,It’s a new model that allows one to move extremely fast.
E_C3_Main_1_1_29,We should be able to reach Orvel in no time and get to Playing.. whatever it's called.
E_C3_Main_1_1_30,"Wow.. How do you know all that, mongrel?"
E_C3_Main_1_1_31,Did you inject yourself with a brain booster or something?
E_C3_Main_1_1_32,Shut up. I was born smart.
E_C3_Main_1_1_33,I also heard some grunts talking about it before.
E_C3_Main_1_1_34,?? What is that giant thing?
E_C3_Main_1_1_35,Huh?
E_C3_Main_1_1_36,"Hey, you haven’t heard about the new thruster? It had a massive upgrade in the power output."
E_C3_Main_1_1_37,The thing that Selva Company carries.
E_C3_Main_1_1_38,"Apparently, that thing is the prototype."
E_C3_Main_1_1_39,What?! What’s something so awesome doing here?
E_C3_Main_1_1_40,I heard that it will be used to deliver posts for a while. It’s a form of a performance test.
E_C3_Main_1_1_41,"Also, because all cargo transports to Orvel are full due to that wish box event."
E_C3_Main_1_1_42,"Wow, just how busy are they with those posts? Desperate enough to use a prototype that wasn't even released?"
E_C3_Main_1_1_43,"Apparently, the event is getting out of control."
E_C3_Main_1_1_44,I even heard that the Empire hosted a conference with the representative of the Shadow Forest to forge an agreement that allows transports to go across the continent with ease.
E_C3_Main_1_1_45,The Shadow Forest? Seriously?
E_C3_Main_1_1_46,"So the post offices really are short-handed, huh."
E_C3_Main_1_1_47,I can't believe an event can shake the whole continent.
E_C3_Main_1_1_48,It’s an event hosted by the company infamous for doing weird stuff with their products. How can anyone still trust them?
E_C3_Main_1_1_49,There's always that 'if'...
E_C3_Main_1_1_50,"Seeing this here, I know what the guys above are thinking."
E_C3_Main_1_1_51,They are going to make the soldiers drive because driving this is apparently a dangerous task.
E_C3_Main_1_1_52,What did we do to deserve this?
E_C3_Main_1_1_53,*Sigh...* What can we do?
E_C3_Main_1_1_54,Let’s think positively. We are going on a road trip to Orvel.
E_C3_Main_1_1_55,Great. Just look at the design of this thing. It looks like a Santa sleigh.
E_C3_Main_1_1_56,Is this some kind of a Christmas edition? What a joke!!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_57,Don't tell me we have to wear the Santa costume as well.
E_C3_Main_1_1_58,"Hahaha! Come on, they won't go that far!!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_59,...Do we really have to wear this corny outfit?
E_C3_Main_1_1_60,"Well, what can we do? It’s the order from the superiors..."
E_C3_Main_1_1_61,Ugh... We were ordered to wear a Christmas outfit to replace our ‘unfriendly’ looking uniform.
E_C3_Main_1_1_62,Dammit! This is so embarrassing!
E_C3_Main_1_1_63,(Good thing we disguised beforehand.)
E_C3_Main_1_1_64,"Alright, let’s steal it now!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_65,Stop! What are you doing?! They're gonna get suspicious if you just run toward them!
E_C3_Main_1_1_66,Let's come up with a plan to secure it with no one noticing.
E_C3_Main_1_1_67,"Alright, the mission will start in 3 minutes."
E_C3_Main_1_1_68,Go over it in your head for the time being.
E_C3_Main_1_1_69,Just BAAAAAAM! And go BOOOOOOM! And ATATATA! Go fast and steal fast!
E_C3_Main_1_1_70,...
E_C3_Main_1_1_71,What you staring at?
E_C3_Main_1_1_72,Don't tell me you forgot what I told you.
E_C3_Main_1_1_73,Go over it again! Now!
E_C3_Main_1_1_74,"Hey, I’m the leader! Why are you giving me orders, mongrel?!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_75,"Well, I’m a leader too!!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_76,"And know your place, crazy! Stop calling me mongrel!!"
E_C3_Main_1_1_77,Know YOUR place! Stop calling me crazy!
E_C3_Main_1_1_78,AHH!!! AHHHH!!! My outfit!!!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_79,Blehhh!
E_C3_Main_1_1_80,YOU!! LITTLE!!!
E_C3_Main_1_1_81,I would have taken you down if it weren’t for the old man!
E_C3_Main_1_1_82,*Sigh* It was foolish of me to think that you’d listen.
E_C3_Main_1_1_83,And we also don’t have much time. I will just go over it myself.
E_C3_Main_1_1_84,Mission starts at 1500. ETA to destination: 1520.
E_C3_Main_1_1_85,Move to point 1 and neutralize the ene- ?!
E_C3_Main_1_1_86,KYAHA!
E_C3_Main_1_1_87,COME BACK HERE! I’M NOT FINISHED YET!
E_C3_Main_1_2_1,Why are there so many goons guarding this place?!
E_C3_Main_1_2_2,Lemme drive!
E_C3_Main_1_2_3,As if I would let a first-time rider drive!
E_C3_Main_1_2_4,You just sit there and stay quiet.
E_C3_Main_1_2_5,Booo!
E_C3_Main_1_2_6,Times Driven: 2
E_C3_Main_1_2_7,So it should be like this... And like that... Wha? It’s wrong?
E_C3_Main_1_2_8,Is it the other way around?
E_C3_Main_1_2_9,"Ha! You don’t know how to drive too, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_1_2_10,At least I have experience in driving! It’s just that it’s been so long!
E_C3_Main_1_2_11,It should be like this then...
E_C3_Main_1_2_12,...
E_C3_Main_1_2_13,"....Ah, screw this!"
E_C3_Main_1_2_14,Why isn't this damn thing moving?
E_C3_Main_1_2_15,?
E_C3_Main_1_2_16,What the?
E_C3_Main_1_2_17,How dare you bully an innocent Santa!
E_C3_Main_1_2_18,I see! You are all vile villains who plan to ruin Christmas for everyone!
E_C3_Main_1_2_19,What the heck is that?!
E_C3_Main_1_2_20,"I will not forgive you, villains!"
E_C3_Main_1_2_21,*Vroom vroom*
E_C3_Main_1_2_22,"Get moving, you piece of junk!! MOVE!!!!!!"
E_C3_Main_1_2_23,"Do something, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_1_2_24,Quiet! Let me focus!
E_C3_Main_1_2_25,Oh!! The engine has sta-
E_C3_Main_1_2_26,J.U.S.T.I.C.E.!!!
E_C3_Main_1_2_27,*Vrooooooom*
E_C3_Main_1_2_28,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
E_C3_Main_1_3_1,Whew... To think that a mere event would shake up the country like this...
E_C3_Main_1_3_2,You look quite drained.
E_C3_Main_1_3_3,"So, the wish box event. Are you not participating?"
E_C3_Main_1_3_4,I sent a coupon with a note describing a perfect statue of mine.
E_C3_Main_1_3_5,Not interested.
E_C3_Main_1_3_6,Why have you come in the first place?
E_C3_Main_1_3_7,Haha... There’s a document that I need to check.
E_C3_Main_1_3_8,Hmm? What's the matter? You don't look so happy.
E_C3_Main_1_3_9,I received reports that soldiers were ordered to help delivering the wish boxes.
E_C3_Main_1_3_10,I am not happy with the fact that our men were assigned to this childish task.
E_C3_Main_1_3_11,"Childish as it may look, there’s no denying that this event is quite influential. I’m sure these orders were given with that in mind."
E_C3_Main_1_3_12,"It’s not that I don’t understand. But... in all honesty, I am rather exhausted."
E_C3_Main_1_3_13,"Because of that, the inquisition has to oversee thruster operations all Christmas."
E_C3_Main_1_3_14,"More specifically... I alone have to oversee them, not the inquisition."
E_C3_Main_1_3_15,"Ah, so you used your authority to send all your subordinates on vacation."
E_C3_Main_1_3_16,What a great boss.
E_C3_Main_1_3_17,It’s been a while since they took some time off.
E_C3_Main_1_3_18,But we cannot have everyone leaving their posts. There should be someone to oversee the soldiers dispatched outside the capital.
E_C3_Main_1_3_19,Indeed. It would be a great loss for the Empire if any of the thrusters are lost or abandoned.
E_C3_Main_1_3_20,*Sigh...* I concur.
E_C3_Main_1_3_21,I ordered my men to place trackers on the prototype thrusters to prevent such from happening.
E_C3_Main_1_3_22,I hope no one causes a situation during this blessed day.
E_C3_Main_1_3_23,Ahem. About that... I’m sorry to say that your hope has been crushed.
E_C3_Main_1_3_24,?!!
E_C3_Main_1_3_25,What is this? A thruster is moving rapidly toward opposite direction!
E_C3_Main_1_3_26,No... It’s not just one... But two!
E_C3_Main_1_3_27,Haha. Interesting.
E_C3_Main_2_1_1,"You are so bad at driving, mongrel!!"
E_C3_Main_2_1_2,I almost threw up!
E_C3_Main_2_1_3,"Shut it! We made it this far, all thanks to me!"
E_C3_Main_2_1_4,"Now, where are we?"
E_C3_Main_2_1_5,Whoa... It’s full of snow.
E_C3_Main_2_1_6,"Hmm? Awww, are you feeling cold, Tersia?"
E_C3_Main_2_1_7,Why is that mongrel shivering?
E_C3_Main_2_1_8,Ahaha! Look at you! Are you imitating Tersia?
E_C3_Main_2_1_9,I’m shaking because you burned my outfit!
E_C3_Main_2_1_10,"Just accept who you are! Dogs don’t wear clothes, you know!"
E_C3_Main_2_1_11,Shut up!
E_C3_Main_2_1_12,I-it’s so freakin’ cold!
E_C3_Main_2_1_13,*Growl*
E_C3_Main_2_1_14,I’m hungry.
E_C3_Main_2_1_15,Huzzah! This should do.
E_C3_Main_2_1_16,I’m sure it’s enough for both Yanne and Gau. Hehe.
E_C3_Main_2_1_17,"Christmas presents, checked... Perfect!"
E_C3_Main_2_1_18,Kyah! Must... eat... Oooop...
E_C3_Main_2_1_19,Quiet!
E_C3_Main_2_1_20,Hmm? I think I heard something..
E_C3_Main_2_1_21,Oh right! I forgot to bring firewood!
E_C3_Main_2_1_22,Now's the chance.
E_C3_Main_2_1_23,Let’s take it all!
E_C3_Main_2_1_24,"Wait, don't take too much."
E_C3_Main_2_1_25,The sleigh will not move quick enough if it's carrying too much weight.
E_C3_Main_2_1_26,I- identify yourselves!!
E_C3_Main_2_1_27,Heyheyhey RUN!!
E_C3_Main_2_1_28,"Hey, there are still prese-"
E_C3_Main_2_1_29,Forget about it! Just leave them behind!
E_C3_Main_2_1_30,Return my presents at once!!
E_C3_Main_2_1_31,*Huff... huff...* I placed a lot of time and effort for the party...
E_C3_Main_2_1_32,Kyaha!
E_C3_Main_2_1_33,...
E_C3_Main_2_2_1,Did you see the look on her face?!
E_C3_Main_2_2_2,"ReTUrN mY PreSeNTs aT OncE, blehhhhhhhh"
E_C3_Main_2_2_3,Kyahahahah!
E_C3_Main_2_2_4,Your ugly face got even uglier!
E_C3_Main_2_2_5,Shut your trap!
E_C3_Main_2_2_6,??!
E_C3_Main_2_2_7,Ahhh!! What the?!
E_C3_Main_2_2_8,"Ouch, my head!!"
E_C3_Main_2_2_9,What the heck? Is he nuts?
E_C3_Main_2_2_10,...
E_C3_Main_2_2_11,*Honk honk*
E_C3_Main_2_2_12,Ou..
E_C3_Main_2_2_13,Hey you! Move aside!
E_C3_Main_2_2_14,I’m going to run you over if you don't!
E_C3_Main_2_2_15,*Huff huff...* Pavel! Watch out!
E_C3_Main_2_2_16,They are present thieves!
E_C3_Main_2_2_17,...
E_C3_Main_2_2_18,*Honk honk*
E_C3_Main_2_2_19,"Wow, this thing also has a horn?"
E_C3_Main_2_2_20,That’s not the important thing now!
E_C3_Main_2_2_21,*Honk honk honk honk honk*
E_C3_Main_2_2_22,Hey!!! Move!
E_C3_Main_2_3_1,Tersia? Why is your face so pale?
E_C3_Main_2_3_2,Arghghgh... It’s so cold!
E_C3_Main_2_3_3,Whoa!!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_4,Wh-what the?!
E_C3_Main_2_3_5,Ahhhhh!!!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_6,Kyaaa!
E_C3_Main_2_3_7,Run!! RUN!!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_8,You don’t want to be hit by that thing!
E_C3_Main_2_3_9,"?! Hey, he's chasing us!"
E_C3_Main_2_3_10,I have no choice then! Witness the power of the new thruster!
E_C3_Main_2_3_11,*VROOOOOM!*
E_C3_Main_2_3_12,He's still chasing us!
E_C3_Main_2_3_13,What a whackjob!
E_C3_Main_2_3_14,?! I don’t think he’s human!
E_C3_Main_2_3_15,Ya think?
E_C3_Main_2_3_16,"Ah, screw this! Full speed ahead!"
E_C3_Main_2_3_17,VROOOOOOOOOM!!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_18,Hmm hmm hmm..
E_C3_Main_2_3_19,??
E_C3_Main_2_3_20,Ahhhhhh! Everything's spinning!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_21,*Screeeech*
E_C3_Main_2_3_22,???
E_C3_Main_2_3_23,*Screeeeeeeech* *Boom!*
E_C3_Main_2_3_24,What the heck?! What's happening?!
E_C3_Main_2_3_25,Ahhh! Smoke is coming out of the sleigh's butt!
E_C3_Main_2_3_26,Is it broken?! What a pain!
E_C3_Main_2_3_27,"We are screwed now!! It’s because of your bad driving, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_2_3_28,I’m gonna tie you to the sleigh!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_29,You do the running!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_30,Tie? Hey!! Tie this!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_31,Tie you? I’m really gonna do-
E_C3_Main_2_3_32,?!
E_C3_Main_2_3_33,That’s..
E_C3_Main_2_3_34,Deer!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_35,??????????
E_C3_Main_2_3_36,Ahhhhhhhh!!!
E_C3_Main_2_3_37,...That was a special limited-edition delicacy..
E_C3_Main_3_1_1,*Huff huff...* That was close..
E_C3_Main_3_1_2,Why is this place full of sand only?
E_C3_Main_3_1_3,The deer are sweating!
E_C3_Main_3_1_4,We are not deer...
E_C3_Main_3_1_5,Release us...
E_C3_Main_3_1_6,Help..
E_C3_Main_3_1_7,It’s too hot here..
E_C3_Main_3_1_8,Shut up! Of course it’s hot! We're in a friggin’ desert!
E_C3_Main_3_1_9,Why do we keep ending up in strange places?! We have to go to Orvel!
E_C3_Main_3_1_10,W-we are going the right way!
E_C3_Main_3_1_11,Don't lie to me!
E_C3_Main_3_1_12,Move!! I will drive!
E_C3_Main_3_1_13,No way! You just want to play Santa!
E_C3_Main_3_1_14,"No, I don’t!"
E_C3_Main_3_1_15,Do you even know what direction Orvel is in?
E_C3_Main_3_1_16,NO!!
E_C3_Main_3_1_17,"Just let me drive those deer, dammit!"
E_C3_Main_3_1_18,"Tsk-tsk, you guys are fighting all the time."
E_C3_Main_3_1_19,??
E_C3_Main_3_1_20,W-why is he here?!
E_C3_Main_3_1_21,"Don't ask me, I don’t know!"
E_C3_Main_3_1_22,I came here to buy a new sword fragment.
E_C3_Main_3_1_23,Why are you looking like a beggar in rags?
E_C3_Main_3_1_24,Look who’s talking. At least I'm wearing something.
E_C3_Main_3_1_25,I got hit by a sandstorm on the way back.
E_C3_Main_3_1_26,"My precious clothes are now ruined, thanks to that. I even made the effort to look festive."
E_C3_Main_3_1_27,Hmm? Where did they go?
E_C3_Main_3_1_28,I thought he was here to pick us up.
E_C3_Main_3_1_29,"Well, turns out he got lost in the desert."
E_C3_Main_3_1_30,Useless as always.
E_C3_Main_3_1_31,Why are these deer so slow?
E_C3_Main_3_1_32,Speed it up!!
E_C3_Main_3_1_33,Stop yelling at the deer!
E_C3_Main_3_1_34,"Give me a ride too, would ya?"
E_C3_Main_3_1_35,Hmm... I barely fit in here.
E_C3_Main_3_1_36,The ride is so bumpy as well.
E_C3_Main_3_1_37,Stop complaining. We are giving you a free ride here.
E_C3_Main_3_1_38,"Meh, it’s not too bad."
E_C3_Main_3_1_39,Drop me off in front of any building you see.
E_C3_Main_3_1_40,*Thud!*
E_C3_Main_3_1_41,ARGH! What now?!
E_C3_Main_3_1_42,?!
E_C3_Main_3_1_43,Wheeee!!!
E_C3_Main_3_1_44,I didn't expect to see a place like this in the desert.
E_C3_Main_3_1_45,Gotta say she becomes extra crazy when she sees them presents.
E_C3_Main_3_1_46,Hey! Get back here!!
E_C3_Main_3_1_47,I’m leaving you behind if you don't!
E_C3_Main_3_1_48,"Come here! There are even bullets here! You love bullets, don’t you?!"
E_C3_Main_3_1_49,PRESENTS!!!
E_C3_Main_3_1_50,What’s this?
E_C3_Main_3_1_51,"Who are you, and why do you interrupt my sandbath?"
E_C3_Main_3_1_52,Bummer.
E_C3_Main_3_1_53,zZZ... Uncle Oddy... Hmm?
E_C3_Main_3_1_54,Dwarf gramps got flown away.
E_C3_Main_3_1_55,?? What’s with this mess?!
E_C3_Main_3_1_56,How dare you disrupt our party?
E_C3_Main_3_1_57,"Also, my pride as a dwarf does not allow me to forgive you for throwing me!"
E_C3_Main_3_1_58,?????
E_C3_Main_3_2_1,*Kuuuuuuuuu!!!*
E_C3_Main_3_2_2,My headbutt is the strongest of them all!!
E_C3_Main_3_2_3,The heck?!
E_C3_Main_3_2_4,"Where do you think you're going?! Help us, you ungrateful good-for-nothing!"
E_C3_Main_3_2_5,"Nope nope, I’m out."
E_C3_Main_3_2_6,I hate getting myself involved in a mess.
E_C3_Main_3_2_7,Hmm.. Perhaps Advisor Idrian’s fortune cookie divination was accurate after all..
E_C3_Main_3_2_8,[Warning! Today is getting-caught-in-a-trashy-situation day!]
E_C3_Main_3_2_9,"Guys, can you just drop me here?"
E_C3_Main_3_2_10,Master Dwarves!! Please free us!!
E_C3_Main_3_2_11,Don't you dare touch my deer! Get lost!!
E_C3_Main_3_2_12,Salvation!
E_C3_Main_3_2_13,Time Distortion!
E_C3_Main_3_2_14,...Ack! You are all so annoying!
E_C3_Main_3_2_15,"Hey, mongrel! It’s no use! No matter how hard I burn them, they just keep coming back!"
E_C3_Main_3_2_16,Tersia is starting to get bored!
E_C3_Main_3_2_17,Argh!! Move it! You drive!
E_C3_Main_3_2_18,Huh?! Yus!! Roger that!
E_C3_Main_3_2_19,"Dammit, I can’t shoot them from this angle!"
E_C3_Main_3_2_20,Hey!! Turn!
E_C3_Main_3_2_21,You've been only going straight so far!
E_C3_Main_3_2_22,"Okay, but can you just drop me first?"
E_C3_Main_3_2_23,"Run deer, run! Hehaha!"
E_C3_Main_3_2_24,"Why is this happening?! This day would've gone just fine if you hadn't done your stupid thing, crazy!"
E_C3_Main_3_2_25,"Come on, I’m not the only one responsible for all this!"
E_C3_Main_3_2_26,Not my fault I picked up a bummer!
E_C3_Main_3_2_27,Um...
E_C3_Main_3_2_28,"Guys, I’m telling you this because I don’t think you are aware of your current situation."
E_C3_Main_3_2_29,"There is a cliff right in front, and we are heading straight to it."
E_C3_Main_3_2_30,"You two can have a peaceful death together, but just leave me out. Please drop me off."
E_C3_Main_3_2_31,?! Turn turn turn turn!!
E_C3_Main_3_2_32,Turn! Change direction!!! Now !!! Crazy!!!
E_C3_Main_3_2_33,What? How do you do that?
E_C3_Main_3_2_34,Guys? Please drop m-
E_C3_Main_3_2_35,Ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_3_2_36,Mitra: ?!
E_C3_Main_3_2_37,"Mitra: Wait, this actually feels really exhilarating."
E_C3_Main_3_2_38,Pansirone: Kyaha! This is so much fun!
E_C3_Main_3_2_39,…
E_C3_Main_3_2_40,(You nutjobs...)
E_C3_Main_3_2_41,"Ho, what is that I’m seeing?"
E_C3_Main_3_2_42,"I am without a clue, Your Majesty. I have never seen such before."
E_C3_Main_3_2_43,What a spectacle.
E_C3_Main_3_2_44,I will have my revenge!
E_C3_Main_4_1_1,Can you please drop me off now?
E_C3_Main_4_1_2,? What?
E_C3_Main_4_1_3,Why is that good-for-nothing still here?
E_C3_Main_4_1_4,"Well, my good friends, it’s been a great journey together."
E_C3_Main_4_1_5,Tcha. I’m just gonna slowly head back to the Empire.
E_C3_Main_4_1_6,"My business here is done,"
E_C3_Main_4_1_7,and I have no intention of accompanying your childish adventure further.
E_C3_Main_4_1_8,"Alright then, ciao."
E_C3_Main_4_1_9,"Oh, and good luck surviving the old man's fist! You are gonna need it!"
E_C3_Main_4_1_10,"Now that I think about it, was it really necessary for us to steal the sleigh?"
E_C3_Main_4_1_11,All we had to do was to borrow it from the military.
E_C3_Main_4_1_12,Huh?! You're the one who came up with the idea!!
E_C3_Main_4_1_13,"Well, I couldn’t think properly in that situation!!"
E_C3_Main_4_1_14,Besides. Pretty sure we broke the machine. Can't return it now.
E_C3_Main_4_1_15,Then let's keep this to ourselves!
E_C3_Main_4_1_16,You want to get beaten up by the old man that badly?
E_C3_Main_4_1_17,We are going to abandon it as soon as we retrieve Valance’s stuff.
E_C3_Main_4_1_18,But I feel like we should take care of the deer...
E_C3_Main_4_1_19,Please abandon us!
E_C3_Main_4_1_20,Why isn't there any snow here anyway? Isn't it winter?
E_C3_Main_4_1_21,These deer are so slow.
E_C3_Main_4_1_22,Can I drive one more time?
E_C3_Main_4_1_23,Not a chance.
E_C3_Main_4_1_24,Booo...
E_C3_Main_4_1_25,*ATATATATATATA!!!*
E_C3_Main_4_1_26,There they are!
E_C3_Main_4_1_27,??
E_C3_Main_4_1_28,Th-that lunatic chased us all the way here! We should run!
E_C3_Main_4_1_29,Justice!
E_C3_Main_4_2_1,Too slow!
E_C3_Main_4_2_2,I’m just gonna run with my feet from here!
E_C3_Main_4_2_3,*ATATATATATATATATA!!!*
E_C3_Main_4_2_4,Hey! Why do you keep bullying us?! What did we do to deserve this?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_5,Beating Santa! Robbing presents! You are all villains! Idiots! Noodle brain!
E_C3_Main_4_2_6,Hey the last one hurts!
E_C3_Main_4_2_7,They don't look like absolute villains to m-
E_C3_Main_4_2_8,Kyaaa!! What is he wearing?! It's the middle of winter!!
E_C3_Main_4_2_9,You... you pervert!
E_C3_Main_4_2_10,What?? Pervert? Did you just call me a pervert?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_11,Yea! You pervert!
E_C3_Main_4_2_12,Why are you taking their side?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_13,"I will not forgive you, pervert!"
E_C3_Main_4_2_14,I’m not a pervert!
E_C3_Main_4_2_15,?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_16,Hey! Haven’t we met before?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_17,Don’t try to fool me!
E_C3_Main_4_2_18,The herald of justice and a pervert cannot be friends!
E_C3_Main_4_2_19,Meteor Kick!
E_C3_Main_4_2_20,*Click!*
E_C3_Main_4_2_21,?? What the? Why isn’t it moving?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_22,Dammit! The left sleigh runner got stuck on the ground!
E_C3_Main_4_2_23,Kyaaa!!!
E_C3_Main_4_2_24,Ugh!
E_C3_Main_4_2_25,?!
E_C3_Main_4_2_26,Kyaaa!!!!!! You perverts!!!!!!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_4_2_27,*BAM!!!!!*
E_C3_Main_4_2_28,Aaaaaaaah!!
E_C3_Main_4_2_29,"Darn it, I almost got them..."
E_C3_Main_4_3_1,Did you check out the package?
E_C3_Main_4_3_2,Not yet.
E_C3_Main_4_3_3,I told you it's something important to you. You really need to open it.
E_C3_Main_4_3_4,I couldn't open it because I haven't received anything.
E_C3_Main_4_3_5,"When I came back, there weren't any packages for me."
E_C3_Main_4_3_6,"Oh, my. I sent it ages ago. It should've been here by now."
E_C3_Main_4_3_7,...I have a bad feeling.
E_C3_Main_4_3_8,"Not only have I not received your package,"
E_C3_Main_4_3_9,I haven't seen the others for a couple days now.
E_C3_Main_4_3_10,...Found these on the floor.
E_C3_Main_4_3_11,"Ah, these are those coupons for that popular wish box event."
E_C3_Main_4_3_12,Hmm. I think I get the picture now.
E_C3_Main_4_3_13,"*Sigh,* I leave them alone for a moment, and they get in trouble."
E_C3_Main_4_3_14,"So, are you not going to go to Orvel?"
E_C3_Main_4_3_15,Must I?
E_C3_Main_4_3_16,"Your bluff doesn't work on me, Crow. You're worried about them."
E_C3_Main_4_3_17,Getting to Orvel isn't some 10-minute walk. I can't go all the way there to pick them up.
E_C3_Main_4_3_18,"But you know, right?"
E_C3_Main_4_3_19,The army is using new thrusters to get to Orvel quickly.
E_C3_Main_4_3_20,It didn't look durable.
E_C3_Main_4_3_21,"Well, I did notice a lot of flaws when I was taking a look. Probably for one-time use."
E_C3_Main_4_3_22,Let's just borrow it since we're only going to use it just for a while.
E_C3_Main_4_3_23,I'll fix her up so that you can get there faster and safer.
E_C3_Main_4_3_24,Why are you doing this?
E_C3_Main_4_3_25,My package is at Orvel. How can I stay still?
E_C3_Main_4_3_26,I see.
E_C3_Main_4_3_27,If it's important to me...
E_C3_Main_4_3_28,And one more.
E_C3_Main_4_3_29,I really want you to spend this Christmas with those kids.
E_C3_Main_4_3_30,They're your other family.
E_C3_Main_4_3_31,...
E_C3_Main_4_3_32,I'm gonna go talk to the army now.
E_C3_Main_4_3_33,"Oh, don't forget to take off your uniform! Can't use the thrusters with the uniform on."
E_C3_Main_4_3_34,I'll pick out your outfit for the trip. *Giggles*
E_C3_Main_4_3_35,...So tiring.
E_C3_Main_4_4_1,Mmhmm~ Hmm~
E_C3_Main_4_4_2,?
E_C3_Main_5_1_1,Ouch... My knee..
E_C3_Main_5_1_2,Where the heck are we now? Dammit...
E_C3_Main_5_1_3,Ugh... My back...
E_C3_Main_5_1_4,"Hey, mongrel... I’m feeling so sleepy.."
E_C3_Main_5_1_5,"Quiet, crazy.. I’m also feeling sleepy."
E_C3_Main_5_1_6,I’m so tired that I’m about to throw up.
E_C3_Main_5_1_7,Ooop!
E_C3_Main_5_1_8,Can we take a short break?
E_C3_Main_5_1_9,Even the deer look tired!
E_C3_Main_5_1_10_Plus,Tersia is totally exhausted too!
E_C3_Main_5_1_10,Shut up!
E_C3_Main_5_1_11,I want to finish this stupid trip quickly so we can go back!
E_C3_Main_5_1_12,Get it together and run!!
E_C3_Main_5_1_13,You don’t even know the right way!
E_C3_Main_5_1_14,We were screwed a long time ago!
E_C3_Main_5_1_15,I’m hungry!
E_C3_Main_5_1_16,At least feed us before making us do things!
E_C3_Main_5_1_17,Enough! Just shut up!
E_C3_Main_5_1_18,There is some meat in the ba-
E_C3_Main_5_1_19,?????
E_C3_Main_5_1_20,*Nom nom....*
E_C3_Main_5_1_21,*Burp*
E_C3_Main_5_1_22,Kya!! She ate all the snacks too!
E_C3_Main_5_1_23,Hey!! Come back here!
E_C3_Main_5_2_1,A Christmas party...
E_C3_Main_5_2_2,I wish sister was here to celebrate it too.
E_C3_Main_5_2_3,I should finish decorating this tree and visit Selene.
E_C3_Main_5_2_4,Hey! @()!@*!!$()!@*
E_C3_Main_5_2_5,What’s that noise?!
E_C3_Main_5_2_6,Annoying! Annoying! This is all so annoying!
E_C3_Main_5_2_7,A chieftain must eat a lot of meat!
E_C3_Main_5_2_8,Stop eating my meat!
E_C3_Main_5_2_9,"Argh!! Get back here, crazy!!"
E_C3_Main_5_2_10,I’m leaving you behind if you don't come back! I’m serious!
E_C3_Main_5_2_11,But she’s pissing me off!
E_C3_Main_5_2_12,Ahhh! I’m gonna burn that thing!
E_C3_Main_5_2_13,Our forest...
E_C3_Main_5_2_14,All my hand-placed decorations...
E_C3_Main_5_3_1,?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_2,"Leave me be, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_5_3_3,Don't interfere!
E_C3_Main_5_3_4,"Listen. If we miss that, we miss the chance to go to Orvel once and for all."
E_C3_Main_5_3_5,This is the last chance probably given by the heavens themselves!
E_C3_Main_5_3_6,Stop right there!!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_7,What is going on he-
E_C3_Main_5_3_8,Kyaaa! The forest!
E_C3_Main_5_3_9,What is this?! How did this happen?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_10,It’s their doing!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_11,Curses! Why are these deer so slow!
E_C3_Main_5_3_12,"Get your things together, you lazy animals!"
E_C3_Main_5_3_13,Want me to throw you to a den of wolves?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_14,I’m tired..
E_C3_Main_5_3_15,I’m hungry... I have no strength left...
E_C3_Main_5_3_16,Stop threatening the deer!
E_C3_Main_5_3_17,Argh!! Shut your trap!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_18,I’m gonna put a bullet in your head when we get back the box!
E_C3_Main_5_3_19,"I’m gonna burn you to ash, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_5_3_20,Halt!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_21,?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_22,What's that now?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_23,?! Friends of nature!!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_24,Save us!!!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_25,We are being tied up forcefully!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_26,?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_27,"Aren’t those dryads of Windland, Lorraine?"
E_C3_Main_5_3_28,Why are they being tied up like that?
E_C3_Main_5_3_29,"My heart shatters, looking at them."
E_C3_Main_5_3_30,"From the looks of it, they must have been forcefully brought out of Windland."
E_C3_Main_5_3_31,They kept shouting they want to be released...
E_C3_Main_5_3_32,No. The Dryads of Windland are not that docile.
E_C3_Main_5_3_33,That's a trap!
E_C3_Main_5_3_34,Ah! Now that you say that... Forgive my foolishness.
E_C3_Main_5_3_35,"You are truly wise, Grand Sage.\nI've learned something new again."
E_C3_Main_5_3_36,No! We are your allies!
E_C3_Main_5_3_37,Ahhhh!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_38,Why are you slowing down?
E_C3_Main_5_3_39,Argh! This is so frustrating!
E_C3_Main_5_3_40,Speed it up! Hurry!

E_C3_Main_5_3_51,Hey stop!! You are burning the presents!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_52,?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_53,Move it!
E_C3_Main_5_3_54,? What?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_55,Dammit... Is there anything we can use as a sleigh runner?
E_C3_Main_5_3_56,Dammit!
E_C3_Main_5_3_57,Dammit!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_58,DAMMIT!!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_59,Ack! What’s this?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_60,I’m tired!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_61,Dammit! This won't do!
E_C3_Main_5_3_62,"Hmm? Hang on, I can feed that to Tersia!"
E_C3_Main_5_3_63,That's not what’s important here!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_64,Feed us!! Please!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_65,Hmm?! Oh! OHH!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_66,This is it!
E_C3_Main_5_3_67,Ahhhhhh! I can’t hold out much longer...
E_C3_Main_5_3_68,"Looks like you enjoyed eating the food, Tersia."
E_C3_Main_5_3_69,Dammit! Why is this so hard to attach?!
E_C3_Main_5_3_70,Time to get going now!
E_C3_Main_5_3_71,Come on... Please work!
E_C3_Main_5_3_72,Oh. Now it’s starting to come to-
E_C3_Main_5_3_73,?
E_C3_Main_5_3_74,AHHHHHHHH!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_75,???! AHHHHHHH!!
E_C3_Main_5_3_76,Kyahaha!
E_C3_Main_6_1_1,*Screech*
E_C3_Main_6_1_2,Oh. Tersia is starting to get bored.
E_C3_Main_6_1_3,*Huff... huff...*
E_C3_Main_6_1_4,You!! Are you really nuts?!
E_C3_Main_6_1_5,What? I’m the one who took us to Orvel.
E_C3_Main_6_1_6,"Be thankful at least once, you ungrateful mongrel."
E_C3_Main_6_1_7,You should have used the booster earlier!
E_C3_Main_6_1_8,You didn't even ask Tersia!
E_C3_Main_6_1_9,UGH! I would have plucked out all the feathers from your cursed parrot if I could get my hands on it!
E_C3_Main_6_1_10,"Pluck out your own hair, mongrel!"
E_C3_Main_6_1_11,He-Help..
E_C3_Main_6_1_12,The thruster... I can't believe they made it into this...
E_C3_Main_6_1_13,What a cool design.
E_C3_Main_6_1_14,I wish I had one for myself.
E_C3_Main_6_1_15,?!
E_C3_Main_6_1_16,"Deer gentlemen, you wouldn’t mind becoming my property, would you?"
E_C3_Main_6_1_17,Eek!!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_18,What a magnificent Santa sleigh.
E_C3_Main_6_1_19,It’s just gorgeous.
E_C3_Main_6_1_20,Here’s to the amazing piece of art that calls out to my soul.
E_C3_Main_6_1_21,I know all the deeds you've done.
E_C3_Main_6_1_22,I’ve received countless reports from everywhere.
E_C3_Main_6_1_23,"You are accused of committing the following crimes, including military supply theft, vandalism, battery and assault, blackmail, arson, and debauchery."
E_C3_Main_6_1_24,"Among them all, however, your worst crime is..."
E_C3_Main_6_1_25,Disrupting my holiday..
E_C3_Main_6_1_26,You will be summoned to the court as soon as we arrive at the Empire.
E_C3_Main_6_1_27,"Ah, and your superior will also be penalized for neglecting his duty as a leader."
E_C3_Main_6_1_28,!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_29,Please release us!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_30,We are the witness! We will tell you all the evil deeds these humans conducted!
E_C3_Main_6_1_31,The same applies to the deer.
E_C3_Main_6_1_32,You will be labeled as accomplices.
E_C3_Main_6_1_33,Your leader in Windland will be contacted regarding this incident.
E_C3_Main_6_1_34,????
E_C3_Main_6_1_35,"Hello, and thank you all for participating in the Playing Playing’s wish box event! I’m May, and I’ll be the special MC for the draw today!!"
E_C3_Main_6_1_36,?!
E_C3_Main_6_1_37,"We’ve all been waiting for this moment so long, haven't we?!"
E_C3_Main_6_1_38,Now then! Let’s see which boxes will be granted a wish!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_39,"We are all excited for this, aren’t we?!!"
E_C3_Main_6_1_40,Yesssssss!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_41,!!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_42,Let's go!!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_43,Ack!!!
E_C3_Main_6_1_44,?!
E_C3_Main_6_1_45,Why are you doing this to us??!!!
E_C3_Main_6_2_1,*Clunk*
E_C3_Main_6_2_2,"Dammit, this thing is unstable again!"
E_C3_Main_6_2_3,What a piece of junk!
E_C3_Main_6_2_4,"Stop right there, criminals!!!"
E_C3_Main_6_2_5,Your detention period will be extended by 10 days for every 10 meters you move away from the officials!
E_C3_Main_6_2_6,I didn’t know such rules existed.
E_C3_Main_6_2_7,Of course not. I just decided to do so right now.
E_C3_Main_6_2_8,?
E_C3_Main_6_2_9,Screw that!!!
E_C3_Main_6_2_10,Let’s just run!!
E_C3_Main_6_2_11,What about the deer?!
E_C3_Main_6_2_12,Forget about them and run!!
E_C3_Main_6_2_13,?! What are they doing?
E_C3_Main_6_2_14,They discarded the thruster!
E_C3_Main_6_2_15,They must be after the event.
E_C3_Main_6_2_16,It is strange if you think about it. Why have they come to Orvel riding a prototype thruster?
E_C3_Main_6_2_17,We should be vigilant nonetheless. We don’t know what havoc they will cause.
E_C3_Main_6_2_18,*Sigh..* We can't bring the thruster to a crowded space like this. We should get off.
E_C3_Main_6_2_19,This is a great opportunity for me to check if my box will win. Haha.
E_C3_Main_6_2_20,"You there, out now."
E_C3_Main_6_2_21,Great... Why does trouble seem to always find me?
E_C3_Main_6_2_22,"Greetings, good sir and madam."
E_C3_Main_6_2_23,"Well, well, if it isn't the masterwork sword hunter."
E_C3_Main_6_2_24,"I’m not sure if you’ve seen them, but your colleagues just ran into that crowd."
E_C3_Main_6_2_25,Really?
E_C3_Main_6_2_26,"Thank you, I was looking for them. I owe you two."
E_C3_Main_6_2_27,They are a bunch of criminals.
E_C3_Main_6_2_28,"If you happen to know anything about what they are planning, I advise you to tell us everything you know."
E_C3_Main_6_2_29,"If you stay silent, then we will label you as an accomplice."
E_C3_Main_6_2_30,An accomplice? How scary! Please don't get me mixed up with them.
E_C3_Main_6_2_31,I’m just here to get back my stuff from them.
E_C3_Main_6_2_32,Is that right? Did they say anything particular to you?
E_C3_Main_6_2_33,"Oops, that was a mistake."
E_C3_Main_6_2_34,"Well, I do remember one thing."
E_C3_Main_6_2_35,They said they were going to retrieve a box that contains an item of great danger..
E_C3_Main_6_2_36,We should go now then.
E_C3_Main_6_2_37,Good luck and farewell!
E_C3_Main_6_2_38,Not so fast. You are a witness. You will come with us.
E_C3_Main_7_1_1,"Alright, everyone, see these boxes?!"
E_C3_Main_7_1_2,These are all precious wish boxes you sent!
E_C3_Main_7_1_3,I hope my box is one of them!
E_C3_Main_7_1_4,I really want to win the draw too! Tee hee!
E_C3_Main_7_1_5,"And now, without further ado, we will get started with the draw!!"
E_C3_Main_7_1_6,Ahhhhhhhh!!
E_C3_Main_7_1_7,MOVE ASIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_1,*Clap clap clap!!* Congratulations!
E_C3_Main_7_2_2,You've won 2nd place!
E_C3_Main_7_2_3,I’m impressed! You must’ve put a lot of effort to gather all those coupons!
E_C3_Main_7_2_4,You will receive 3 gifts of your choice from the list you wrote!
E_C3_Main_7_2_5,Congratulations once again!
E_C3_Main_7_2_6,And now! The moment all you've been waiting for!!! Time to pick the 1st place!!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_7,Who will be the winner of this event?!
E_C3_Main_7_2_8,It’s time!!! To pick the winner who gets the chance to turn all the old toys into brand new gifts of their dreams!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_9,*Drum roll*
E_C3_Main_7_2_10,Noooooooooo!!!!!

E_C3_Main_7_2_12,Huh? O-old man?
E_C3_Main_7_2_13,M-mister...
E_C3_Main_7_2_14,"Mongrel... I think we are seeing things... It was a hard journey, after all."
E_C3_Main_7_2_15,It’s all over..
E_C3_Main_7_2_16,And the 1st place goes to!!!!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_17,"Wow, I can't believe you gathered so many coupons!!"
E_C3_Main_7_2_18,Ta-da!! You are the winner!!!!

E_C3_Main_7_2_21,I-I um... Can't believe I’ve... won... Haha...
E_C3_Main_7_2_22,?????
E_C3_Main_7_2_23,Huh?!
E_C3_Main_7_2_24,Oh!?
E_C3_Main_7_2_25,Actually! We had a participant with even more coupons than the winner!
E_C3_Main_7_2_26,"But! Unfortunately, their coupons will be all disqualified!"
E_C3_Main_7_2_27,?????
E_C3_Main_7_2_28,The event got so huge that we started receiving fake coupons!
E_C3_Main_7_2_29,What the participants don't know is that Playing Playing examines each coupon extremely carefully!
E_C3_Main_7_2_30,None of the fake coupons can get through! Playing Playing makes sure no one cheats! Remember folks!
E_C3_Main_7_2_31,"We do give free gifts, but we want to do it fairly!"
E_C3_Main_7_2_32,Let’s all be honest and fair!
E_C3_Main_7_2_33,...
E_C3_Main_7_2_34,I can't believe you put in fakes.
E_C3_Main_7_2_35,"Hey, they were just a few!"
E_C3_Main_7_2_36,What are you two doing here?
E_C3_Main_7_2_37,We.. Eh..
E_C3_Main_7_2_38,And now! We will return all the unlucky boxes back to their owners!
E_C3_Main_7_2_39,I’m sure the contents inside the boxes are still your precious toys! We will send them carefully by using magic!
E_C3_Main_7_2_40,!!!!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_41,The box!
E_C3_Main_7_2_42,What’s in it?
E_C3_Main_7_2_43,No-nothing!
E_C3_Main_7_2_44,Yeah! It’s nothing!
E_C3_Main_7_2_45,It’s just this crazy’s toy!
E_C3_Main_7_2_46,Y-yeah! It’s just my toy!
E_C3_Main_7_2_47,Open it where I can see it.
E_C3_Main_7_2_48,Hand over that box now!
E_C3_Main_7_2_49,?!
E_C3_Main_7_2_50,What the heck?! Why are you taking that!
E_C3_Main_7_2_51,I heard that there’s something really dangerous inside this box.
E_C3_Main_7_2_52,"Yoo! Long-time no see, mister."
E_C3_Main_7_2_53,No! Don't open it!!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_54,Ugh!
E_C3_Main_7_2_55,Phew! Saf-
E_C3_Main_7_2_56,"Oh, thank you very much."

E_C3_Main_7_2_64,Stop yell-
E_C3_Main_7_2_65,*BOOM!!!!!!!*
E_C3_Main_7_2_66,Wooooow!! That’s so cool!!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_67,Wh-what is that?!!
E_C3_Main_7_2_68,Whoa...
E_C3_Main_7_2_69,*Sigh* So this was it.
E_C3_Main_7_2_70,How unnecessary.
E_C3_Main_7_2_71,Just when did you prepare such a romantic gift?!
E_C3_Main_7_2_72,This makes us feel so loved. Keke.
E_C3_Main_7_2_73,Shush.
E_C3_Main_7_2_74,Don't you think that one kinda looks like me?
E_C3_Main_7_2_75,That thing that looks like a face over there.
E_C3_Main_7_2_76,"Hmm... Nah, it's not ugly."
E_C3_Main_7_2_77,Why you little!
E_C3_Main_7_2_78,Ridiculous... Just ridiculous...
E_C3_Main_7_2_79,"You don't look all that angry or disappointed, though."
E_C3_Main_7_2_80,"To be honest... A bizarre Christmas like this isn’t so bad, after all."
E_C3_Main_7_2_81,Haha...
E_C3_Main_7_2_82,It really is a lovely Christmas night.
E_C3_Main_7_2_83,It is a pretty sight.
E_C3_Main_7_2_84,"Ah, I should prepare to leave once the fire settles."
E_C3_Main_7_2_85,There’s still one stolen sleigh left.
E_C3_Main_7_2_86,"Wow, that’s so pretty!"
E_C3_Main_7_2_87,What a Christmas to remember.
E_C3_Main_7_2_88,Except for those perverts.
E_C3_Main_7_2_89,Yeah...
E_C3_Main_7_2_90,"Now that we are here, wanna visit my grandpa?"
E_C3_Main_7_2_91,I also know a place that serves amazing spicy udon.
E_C3_Main_7_2_92,"Oh, I almost forgot. Where’s my sword piece?"
