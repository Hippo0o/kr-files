CONVERSATION_TU_256_1,"Stop! Public access is restricted from here on."
CONVERSATION_TU_256_2,"No outsiders are allowed past this point!"
CONVERSATION_TU_256_3,"My name is Kasel, an apprentice knight in service to Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_TU_256,"What's going on here? These people seem tense for some reason."
CONVERSATION_TU_257,"You must not have heard. An old vault was found in the underground."
CONVERSATION_TU_257_1,"We believe it was where the ancient royal family kept their treasures safe. A team of investigators was dispatched right after the discovery,"
CONVERSATION_TU_257_2,"but the sudden appearance of monsters is keeping them from doing their job."
CONVERSATION_TU_258,"Of all places, why are monsters appearing in royal palace?"
CONVERSATION_TU_259,"Except for a few apprentice knights, almost all of the knights were called in to rid the monsters."
CONVERSATION_TU_260,"The knights will not be able to take care of any other business until everything is settled."
CONVERSATION_TU_261,"Kasel, don't you think we should leave for now?"
CONVERSATION_TU_262,"I don't think the knights can help anyone else in a situation like this."
CONVERSATION_TU_263,"Hm..."
CONVERSATION_TU_264,"I may just be an apprentice knight myself, but I'd like to do my part as a knight."
CONVERSATION_TU_265,"Is there anything I can do to help?"
CONVERSATION_TU_266,"As a matter of fact, we're currently recruiting capable warriors to take on the monsters."
CONVERSATION_TU_266_1,"The more help we can get, the faster the knights can resume their everyday duties."
CONVERSATION_TU_266_2,"His Majesty promised rewards to those who defeat the monsters."
CONVERSATION_TU_266_3,"If you think you're up for it, feel free to lend a hand."
CONVERSATION_TU_267,"When does the shift rotate again? Let's see... Only 7 years left? Great!"
CONVERSATION_TU_268,"Wow, an ancient tower in a place like this? Interesting."
CONVERSATION_TU_269,"Huh? Humans! All of you are humans, right?"
CONVERSATION_TU_270,"I've heard of the humans from storytellings before, but I did not expect to see one in my life."
CONVERSATION_TU_271,"It has been quite a while, Dosarta."
CONVERSATION_TU_272,"Sister? I'm so glad that you're here!"
CONVERSATION_TU_273,"Oh, and who are these people?"
CONVERSATION_TU_274,"Right. Let me introduce you to the warrior of the Holy Sword, and his companions."
CONVERSATION_TU_275,"The warrior... of the Holy Sword? Seriously?"
CONVERSATION_TU_276,"That's amazing! The great warrior, in front of my eyes!"
CONVERSATION_TU_277,"Hahaha... Please, I don't deserve to be addressed as 'great'."
CONVERSATION_TU_278,"Um, Dosarta just called you sister. Does that mean...?"
CONVERSATION_TU_279,"Yes, Dosarta here is my blood sister."
CONVERSATION_TU_280,"Here, the Tower of Challenge, is something our elven royal family has been taking care of."
CONVERSATION_TU_281,"It is the task of the royal children to keep watch. We have been doing it in shifts, each shift being 20 years long."
CONVERSATION_TU_282,"20 years...?"
CONVERSATION_TU_283,"No need to be surprised. 20 years of your lifespan is like 2 years to the elves."
CONVERSATION_TU_284,"Um, so the warrior of the Holy Sword in a place like this means..."
CONVERSATION_TU_285,"Yes, it's about time we open the gate of the Tower of Challenge."
CONVERSATION_TU_286,"Sweet! Then I'll be able to see these people often. Looks like I won't be bored from now on."
CONVERSATION_TU_287,"Sorry to interrupt, but mind telling us about this place?"
CONVERSATION_TU_288,"I've never seen or heard of such a tower standing so tall in Elidora Forest."
CONVERSATION_TU_289,"This tower existed long before people started recording history."
CONVERSATION_TU_290,"Our Elven Royal Family has been investigating this tower for a very long time,"
CONVERSATION_TU_291,"yet we still haven't discovered why, and when this tower was built."
CONVERSATION_TU_292,"However, during the investigation, we found the remains of ancient artifacts."
CONVERSATION_TU_293,"Furthermore, we even managed to restore the artifacts by putting together the pieces."
CONVERSATION_TU_294,"Only then did we discover that the artifacts possess unique and strong power."
CONVERSATION_TU_295,"Unique... and strong?"
CONVERSATION_TU_296,"Speaking of which, since our great warrior is here, let me tell you a story regarding the artifacts."
CONVERSATION_TU_297,"100 years ago, King Kyle of Orvelia was seeking power to fight off the Demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_298,"His search led him to the rumored Tower of Challenge. After arriving at the tower, he started climbing it alone. "
CONVERSATION_TU_299,"However, each floor of the tower was filled with fearsome monsters."
CONVERSATION_TU_300,"According to the investigations, these monsters emit an otherworldly aura."
CONVERSATION_TU_301,"Nonetheless, King Kyle had to defeat the monsters of the tower to acquire artifact pieces."
CONVERSATION_TU_302,"An otherworldly aura? So these monsters are from the other dimension?"
CONVERSATION_TU_303,"We don't know the details yet. Everything I've just said is simply inferences by the scholars."
CONVERSATION_TU_304,"Back to the story, King Kyle later managed to find all the artifact pieces."
CONVERSATION_TU_305,"And with the help of our Elven Royal Family, he got the artifacts restored."
CONVERSATION_TU_306,"Afterward, all of Elidora came to praise King Kyle for his victory against all the monsters in this tower,"
CONVERSATION_TU_307,"and as a tribute to his challenging spirit, this tower was named the 'Tower of Challenge.'"
CONVERSATION_TU_308,"That is quite a deep story."
CONVERSATION_TU_309,"Indeed. The monsters of the tower are still strong and savage."
CONVERSATION_TU_310,"At one point, the adventurers who had heard of King Kyle's heroic tales entered this tower."
CONVERSATION_TU_311,"Sadly, they all failed. Some even lost their lives."
CONVERSATION_TU_312,"That's why our Elven Royal Family has been guarding this tower to prevent anyone from entering it. "
CONVERSATION_TU_313,"However, now that the Demons threaten our land, and the Holy Sword Aea has shown itself once again,"
CONVERSATION_TU_314,"it is time for us to open the gate, so you can acquire the artifacts once again."
CONVERSATION_TU_315,"I hope this serves as an opportunity to strengthen your power and skill."
CONVERSATION_TU_316,"King Kyle of Orvelia came to the Tower of Challenge,"
CONVERSATION_TU_317,"requesting access because he needed strong powers to defeat the demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_318,"He took back the pieces of artifacts from the insane who were still calling for their 'precious',"
CONVERSATION_TU_319,"and put the pieces back together."
CONVERSATION_TU_320,"Wasn't Kyle cursed by touching the artifact?"
CONVERSATION_TU_321,"Upon putting together the artifacts, an analysis took place,"
CONVERSATION_TU_322,"and it revealed that when the artifacts had been destroyed, the curse too had disappeared."
CONVERSATION_TU_323,"And the curse will not return, even if those artifacts become whole?"
CONVERSATION_TU_324,"The analysis implied that the curse only worked while the artifact was inside the Tower of Challenge."
CONVERSATION_TU_325,"While it is believed that no artifacts remain whole as of now, we cannot be sure."
CONVERSATION_TU_326,"Since those undying cursed ones are still too dangerous,"
CONVERSATION_TU_327,"we have locked the gate of the Tower and watched over it."
CONVERSATION_TU_328,"But now, things are different. The holy sword showed up, which is a signal that the world is in danger."
CONVERSATION_TU_329,"Therefore, we are opening the gate today, allowing you to challenge the Tower."

CONVERSATION_INTRO_51,"About a century ago, a wizard opened the Demon's Gate"

CONVERSATION_INTRO_53,"The Dark Lord Angmund"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_54,"proclaimed himself King of the World"

CONVERSATION_INTRO_56,"But the righteous marched forth towards the Dark Lord's fortress,\n\nwading through pain and despair."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_57,"These heroes were King Kyle of Orvelia,\n\nthe last kingdom of humans, and his brave companions."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_58,"A fierce battle raged in front of Angmund's fortress."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_59,"While his companions desperately fought off the Dark Legion,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_60,"Kyle walked into the Dark Lord's castle alone"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_61,"and stabbed Angmund's heart with the Holy Sword Aea."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_62,"Only the Holy Sword remained."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_63,"There was no trace of Kyle or Angmund."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_64,"Without their lord, the demons quickly weakened,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_65,"and the war ended in victory\n\nfor the people of the land."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_66,"By the time peace was restored to the continent\n\nand the wounds of the old war had started to fade,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_67,"an unknown darkness creeped around the Holy Sword Aea."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_68,"The heroes who fought alongside Kyle"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_69,"sealed the Holy Sword Aea inside the World Tree\n\nthat Lua, the Goddess of Light, had blessed"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_70,"and prayed for everlasting protection from the Darkness."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_71,"Now, a hundred years have passed after the Demon's Gate opened."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_72,"and the traces of war had long since disappeared in Orvelia, the kingdom of humans."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_73,"Although humankind believed this peace would continue for a long time,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_74,"a shroud of darkness\n\nhad already begun to creep in around the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_75,"Iris, the Great Priestess of the Lua Order,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_76,"sensed the feeble spirit of Angmund"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_77,"who everyone thought had disappeared for good."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_78,"To investigate the situation, the Kingdom of Orvelia dispatches an expedition."
CONVERSATION_5000,"I was so close to becoming a full-fledged knight. Why now!?"
CONVERSATION_5001,"Haha. Are you feeling bad because you can't join the expedition?"
CONVERSATION_5002,"I'm proud of you, little brother. Look how brave you are even though you are just a squire."
CONVERSATION_5003,"It's not that I feel bad. I want to go with you because I am worried!"
CONVERSATION_5004,"Apparently this is the biggest expedition since the war against the Dark Legion! Something big must be coming!"
CONVERSATION_5005,"Hahaha. A squire worrying about an expedition of Royal Knights!"
CONVERSATION_5006,"If the senior knights hear you, their pride will be bruised. Keep that up and you'll find yourself getting another noogie."
CONVERSATION_5007,"I would put up with a lot of noogies just to go with you."
CONVERSATION_5008,"As a Royal Knight, I'll tell you again, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5009,"What you need to do is to protect the people of Orvel from danger while we're not around."
CONVERSATION_5010,"For a knight, there is no duty more sacred than protecting their people and country. Don't ever forget that."
CONVERSATION_5011,"Okay. A squire has to trust the expedition and do his work here."
CONVERSATION_5012,"Now, straighten those shoulders, Kasel. You will be a full-fledged knight soon enough."
CONVERSATION_5013,"You will definitely do important things for our homeland someday,"
CONVERSATION_5014,"and I will be there with you."
CONVERSATION_5015,"Why are you so serious? This isn't like you. You're scaring me."
CONVERSATION_5016,"Well, let's just say I'm an inspirational man. Hahaha."
CONVERSATION_5017,"Haha. I wouldn't call that very inspirational."
CONVERSATION_5018,"That's right. Just keep smiling like that. I promise to return safely after we complete the mission."
CONVERSATION_5019,"For the honor of the Royal Knights of Orvelia!"
CONVERSATION_5020,"Right. The expedition should be fine since they have you. I will await your safe return."
CONVERSATION_2302,"28 Days Later..."
CONVERSATION_5021,"I've been waiting for so long, but still no news from the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5022,"Ominous rumors are swirling that this expedition was not a simple investigation,"
CONVERSATION_5023,"but a fight against the Demons that have reappeared."
CONVERSATION_5024,"I cannot wait any longer."
CONVERSATION_5025,"If it's really the Demons that they are up against,"
CONVERSATION_5026,"I must go. "
CONVERSATION_5027,"I can't put my brother, the only brother I have, in danger!"
CONVERSATION_5028,"The expedition was headed south, and then east."
CONVERSATION_5029,"If I follow that path, I will definitely catch up to them."
CONVERSATION_5030,"Kasel, where are you going?"
CONVERSATION_5031,"Huh? Frey, aren't you supposed to be at the temple?"
CONVERSATION_5032,"Today is my day off!"
CONVERSATION_5033,"I will come with you if you are leaving to find Clause!"
CONVERSATION_5034,"How did you know...?"
CONVERSATION_5035,"Because.. I would do the same if I were in your place."
CONVERSATION_5036,"What are you talking about? It's too dangerous for an apprentice priest to leave the castle!"
CONVERSATION_5037,"There is no news from the expedition. We don't know what's going on out there."
CONVERSATION_5038,"Hah! Kasel, do you have any idea what priests do?"
CONVERSATION_5039,"It's dangerous for priests to go on expeditions on their own."
CONVERSATION_5040,"But don't you realize it's also dangerous for anyone to leave on an expedition without a priest?"
CONVERSATION_5041,"But..."
CONVERSATION_5042,"You can't tell me not to come, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5043,"You're not the only one who is worried about Clause."
CONVERSATION_5044,"And, if you also do not return..."
CONVERSATION_5045,"..."
CONVERSATION_5046,"Okay. Let's go together, then."
CONVERSATION_5047,"But remember, don't stray too far from me."
CONVERSATION_5048,"We don't know what dangers are lurking about."
CONVERSATION_5049,"Frey, you must leave the temple today."
CONVERSATION_5050,"Great Priestess, what do you mean? Have I done something wrong?"
CONVERSATION_5051,"No. You have a mission."
CONVERSATION_5052,"Follow your heart, and you'll find Lua watching over you every step of the way."
CONVERSATION_5053,"My soul only belongs to Lua, the Goddess of Light."
CONVERSATION_5054,"I know how deep your faith is, Frey. I also understand your concern. I can see it in your eyes."
CONVERSATION_5055,"Great Priestess..."
CONVERSATION_5056,"Your path awaits you outside the temple, at the entrance to the capital."
CONVERSATION_5058,"The path on which Lua will lead you will be filled with pain and hardships."
CONVERSATION_5059,"Please lead his path with light as he encounters and fights against the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5060,"Hardship? Is that what Clause is going through..."
CONVERSATION_5061,"You will be able to meet him at the entrance to the capital, outside the temple."
CONVERSATION_5062,"You must help him so he does not succumb to the Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5063,"A path with pain and hardships..."
CONVERSATION_5064,"Will I be able to follow the righteous path?"
CONVERSATION_5065,"What is happening in the outside of Orvel...?"
CONVERSATION_5066,"Frey! What are you doing there? Hurry up!"
CONVERSATION_5067,"Wait, Kasel! I'm coming!"
CONVERSATION_5068,"Oh Goddess Lua, please guide us by lighting our way. "
CONVERSATION_5069,"and guide us by lighting our way."
CONVERSATION_5070,"We've been walking for more than half a day... I hope nothing happened to the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5071,"Don't worry too much, Kasel. We'll find them."
CONVERSATION_2356,"Go back, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2357,"*Sigh*..."
CONVERSATION_2358,"*Sigh* Don't do this, Cleo. The Tower is going crazy about this."
CONVERSATION_2359,"The people at the Tower are worried about you."
CONVERSATION_2360,"Aaaaaaaaaah! Come on!"
CONVERSATION_2361,"It's not that I don't understand how you feel, but I'm in a difficult position too."
CONVERSATION_2362,"I also have a job to do."
CONVERSATION_2363,"Just think about how much you're worrying him..."
CONVERSATION_2364,"I don't want to hear it! Just go back! Go back!"
CONVERSATION_2367,"Ah! excuse me, Mr. Knight!"
CONVERSATION_2368,"I think someone's calling you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2369,"Huh? Me?"
CONVERSATION_2370,"Please help me! He's a pervert!"
CONVERSATION_2371,"*Sigh* Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_2372,"Kasel! Some weird pervert must be harassing her! Let's help her!"
CONVERSATION_2373,"What a pain in the neck.. I'm telling you, this is a misunderstanding!"
CONVERSATION_2374,"Just putting this out there, this is a misunderstanding."
CONVERSATION_2375,"I was just...!"
CONVERSATION_2376,"Eeeek! Help me!"
CONVERSATION_2377,"I don't know who you may be, but stay away from the lady!"
CONVERSATION_2378,"Get away from the lady!"
CONVERSATION_2380,"Man.. Seriously..?"
CONVERSATION_2381,"Look around, you three."
CONVERSATION_2382,"Wolves? When did they...!?"
CONVERSATION_2383,"I guess we were making too much noise here."
CONVERSATION_2384,"Well, we have no choice now."
CONVERSATION_2385,"Pervert or not, we have to deal with this first."
CONVERSATION_2386,"I guess we have no choice. Let me handle this!"
CONVERSATION_2387,"Those doggies have no sense of common courtesy!"
CONVERSATION_2388,"Those doggies can't read the mood!"
CONVERSATION_2389,"Everyone, be careful!"
CONVERSATION_2390,"Is it over now?"
CONVERSATION_2392,"Don't get too comfortable just yet. Stay alert!"
CONVERSATION_2393,"Eek! There's more!"
CONVERSATION_2394,"That big one over there seems to be the leader."
CONVERSATION_2395,"Looks like he's the head of the pack."
CONVERSATION_5595,"So, killing him will clear the rest?"
CONVERSATION_5596,"I guess so."
CONVERSATION_5597,"A pack of wolves near the town...?"
CONVERSATION_5598,"Many of the watch were drafted into the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5599,"I'm going back in. Be careful, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5072,"*Whew* I'm glad no one got injured."
CONVERSATION_5073,"It could've been bad if it weren't for this guy."
CONVERSATION_5074,"But he's a pervert."
CONVERSATION_5075,"Lady, you can't go around misjudging a perfectly normal person like me."
CONVERSATION_2406,"Like I told you before, I'm just here to escort Cleo back home."
CONVERSATION_2407,"Am I not, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_2408,"Don't be fooled by his words!"
CONVERSATION_2409,"Cleo, will you stop this nonsense?"
CONVERSATION_2410,"Are you going to have me raise my blade against them or something? Is that what you want?"
CONVERSATION_2411,"Just stop it."
CONVERSATION_2412,"Let's go back, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_2413,"... I still won't go back! I've made myself very clear! "
CONVERSATION_2414,"I've made myself very clear!"
CONVERSATION_2415,"I'm not playing around this time."
CONVERSATION_2416,"I..."
CONVERSATION_2417,"*Sigh* I know that you want to find some clues yourself. But..."
CONVERSATION_2418,"You have clues to find..."
CONVERSATION_2419,"E-excuse me?"
CONVERSATION_2420,"Um... I don't know what's going on between you two, but I can see that you're not a pervert."
CONVERSATION_2421,"We're going to get going now, then."
CONVERSATION_2422,"Sorry, we really thought you were.."
CONVERSATION_2423,"It's okay. But Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_2424,"I know you didn't mean to cause trouble, but don't you think you should apologize to them?"
CONVERSATION_2425,"Humph!"
CONVERSATION_5076,"Haha. You don't have to apologize."
CONVERSATION_5077,"I'm sorry we misjudged you."
CONVERSATION_5078,"That's okay. Cleo, was it?"
CONVERSATION_5079,"I don't know what clues you are looking for, but I will pray for you."
CONVERSATION_5080,"And this guy who is so worried about you..."
CONVERSATION_5081,"What was your name again, Sir?"
CONVERSATION_5082,"My name is Roi. "
CONVERSATION_5083,"Right. You don't want Mr. Roi, who's so worried about you, to get in trouble now, do you?"
CONVERSATION_2430,"Ughh... I'm sorry for putting you in danger.."
CONVERSATION_2431,"I'm sorry I put you in danger.."
CONVERSATION_2432,"Wow, you really apologized? Maybe I should check to see if hell froze over, too."
CONVERSATION_2433,"Did you just say you're sorry?"
CONVERSATION_2434,"But Roi, I'm never going back."
CONVERSATION_2435,"Even if you drag me back, I'll come out again, and again."
CONVERSATION_2436,"I have work I must do."
CONVERSATION_2437,"I'll escape again and again. A million times if I have to. I have something I must do!"
CONVERSATION_5084,"Cleo... That's..."
CONVERSATION_5085,"Which way are you headed? The direction you were coming from tells me you just left Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5086,"Cleo, stop cutting me off..."
CONVERSATION_5087,"Right! You were coming from the opposite direction."
CONVERSATION_5088,"Did you happen to run into an expedition group from Orvel?"
CONVERSATION_5089,"Hey, can we take turns..? One at a time please."
CONVERSATION_5090,"Sorry! We are looking for a group that was dispatched from Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5091,"It's been almost a month, but we haven't heard anything from them yet."
CONVERSATION_5092,"Come to think of it, we did see traces of a camp along the way."
CONVERSATION_5093,"Yes, my brother."
CONVERSATION_5094,"Kasel and I grew up with him in the same orphanage..."
CONVERSATION_5095,"Hmm..."
CONVERSATION_5096,"Come to think of it, we did see traces of a camp along the way."
CONVERSATION_5097,"Ah, that we saw! Why don't you come with us? We'll take you there!"
CONVERSATION_5098,"Why don't you come with us! We will take you there!"
CONVERSATION_5099,"Since when did you become so nice..."
CONVERSATION_5100,"I see...So this is a warmth she never felt at the Tower of the Sage..."
CONVERSATION_5101,"I should suggest hiring a priest once we get back."
CONVERSATION_5102,"Huh? What are you mumbling about?"
CONVERSATION_5103,"I don't know what scheme you're trying to pull here, but can't you just go?"
CONVERSATION_5104,"I have people to help."
CONVERSATION_5105,"I'll stay with these guys. They need my help!"
CONVERSATION_5106,"*Sigh* That stubbornness of yours..."
CONVERSATION_5107,"Hey, Knight. You wouldn't mind me joining you, do you?"
CONVERSATION_2466,"Let us accompany you for a while, Mister Knight."
CONVERSATION_2467,"I have my reasons, too."
CONVERSATION_2468,"What? Roi?"
CONVERSATION_2469,"I made an oath to the Tower of the Sage. I can't just abandon it."
CONVERSATION_5108,"Thanks! When I find my brother, I will return the favor."
CONVERSATION_5109,"Good for you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2472,"Let me properly introduce myself. My name is Cleo, and I'm a wizard from the Tower of Sage."
CONVERSATION_5110,"My name is Cleo, and I'm a sorceress from the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2474,"I..."
CONVERSATION_5111,"I'm Roi. I'm supposed to be this kid's escort."
CONVERSATION_2476,"The name is Roi."
CONVERSATION_2477,"I'm Kasel, a squire of Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_2478,"My name is Frey. I'm a disciple of Iris, the Great Priestess."
CONVERSATION_5112,"And.. you are both apprentices?"
CONVERSATION_5113,"Why do you seem so surprised, Roi? Are you looking down on them for being apprentices?"
CONVERSATION_5114,"Quite the opposite. I was surprised by their competence."
CONVERSATION_5115,"Haha. You were?"
CONVERSATION_5116,"That priestess really has a knack for calming Cleo down. This is going to be interesting..."
CONVERSATION_5117,"Her talent for influencing people is considerable. Very useful. Fufufu..."
CONVERSATION_5118,"Why is he looking at Frey with that wicked grin on his face?"
CONVERSATION_5119,"H-he's not really a pervert, is he, Miss Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5120,"That's nonsense."
CONVERSATION_5121,"Haha. Roi may not make a great impression, but I promise he's not the type to molest people."
CONVERSATION_5122,"But, hmm... a man would definitely look at you with a wicked smile... hmm..."
CONVERSATION_5123,"It's impolite to stare at a specific part of someone's body like that."
CONVERSATION_5123_GF,"It's impolite to stare at a specific part of someone's body like that."
CONVERSATION_5124,"What? You fool! This misunderstanding started all because of your wicked smile!"
CONVERSATION_5125,"No, it started because you treated me like a pervert."
CONVERSATION_5126,"Umm, could we get going now?"
CONVERSATION_5127,"I'm sorry to rush you, but I really have to catch up to them."
CONVERSATION_5128,"Oh, you're right! Let's get going!"
CONVERSATION_2483,"Wow, what are those?"
CONVERSATION_2484,"Slimes! Aren't they adorable?"
CONVERSATION_2485,"They're.. adorable..?"
CONVERSATION_2486,"I tried to breed a slime at home once,"
CONVERSATION_2487,"but the whole bottle just melted..."
CONVERSATION_2488,"And I had to clean it up."
CONVERSATION_2489,"Roi! That's the reason why girls don't like you! You're so petty!"
CONVERSATION_2490,"You two seem very close!"
CONVERSATION_2491,"Says who!"
CONVERSATION_5129,"Why is he examining that slime so carefully?"
CONVERSATION_5130,"Kasel has finally discovered how charming slimes can be!!"
CONVERSATION_5131,"The weapons embedded in the slime... I was checking to see if they belonged to our knights or to another expedition from Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5132,"Thankfully, they do not."
CONVERSATION_5133,"You misread the mood here, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5134,"Oh no. I apologize if I embarrassed you."
CONVERSATION_5135,"That's right, Miss Cleo. Kasel was just a little worried....."
CONVERSATION_5136,"See, Roi?"
CONVERSATION_5137,"Hah... I guess this time it was me."
CONVERSATION_5137_0,"It's all right, Mr. Roi. I guess you said it out of consideration for Kasel's feelings."
CONVERSATION_5137_1,"I'm fine. It might be better if I treat Cleo the way you guys do."
CONVERSATION_5137_2,"Excuse me? What did I do?"
CONVERSATION_5137_3,"At this rate, this argument will never end. Are you done observing the slime, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5137_4,"Yes. I am ready now."
CONVERSATION_2507,"What kind of slime is that?"
CONVERSATION_2508,"It's a giant slime!"
CONVERSATION_2509,"I've never seen a slime that big before."
CONVERSATION_2510,"I really want to keep it!"
CONVERSATION_5138,"Roi, could you please bring that slime back to the Tower of the Sage later?"
CONVERSATION_2512,"Nope."
CONVERSATION_2513,"It looks like we will have to get rid of it before we can go any further."
CONVERSATION_2514,"Then let's slash it down."
CONVERSATION_2515,"Don't kill it, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2516,"I don't think he's listening.."
CONVERSATION_2517,"Humph! Stupid Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2518,"Roi, you idiot! Why did you kill it!?"
CONVERSATION_5139,"Hmm. Just as I expected. Slimes are a little hard to cut."
CONVERSATION_5140,"Oh. I'm sorry, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5141,"Is this also your first time seeing such an enormous slime, Miss Cleo and Mr. Roi?"
CONVERSATION_5142,"Yeah! Who in the world created..."
CONVERSATION_5143,"such an enormous slime?"
CONVERSATION_5144,"Perhaps, the rumors..."
CONVERSATION_5145,"What rumors?"
CONVERSATION_5146,"Oh, the one about the demons having appeared again?"
CONVERSATION_5147,"Have you heard the rumors, too, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5148,"Briefly at Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5149,"I could've heard more if that stupid Roi hadn't chased after me."
CONVERSATION_5150,"I never knew such rumors were being spread."
CONVERSATION_5151,"If the rumors are true, I doubt the demons would be wasting their time making slime..."
CONVERSATION_5152,"The slime might not have been made by anyone."
CONVERSATION_5153,"They could have been affected by the magic and grown big on their own."
CONVERSATION_5154,"Whatever the case, this is abnormal."
CONVERSATION_5155,"I hope everything is okay with Clause..."
CONVERSATION_2536,"Eww, gross! Why are there spiders in a place like this?"
CONVERSATION_2537,"How can you say that about spiders when you love slime so much?"
CONVERSATION_2538,"You're so unpredictable."
CONVERSATION_2539,"They're gross!"
CONVERSATION_2540,"Look at those legs!"
CONVERSATION_2541,"And those eyes too!"
CONVERSATION_2542,"Those bloodsucking spiders are quite good when they're cooked!"
CONVERSATION_2543,"You eat those things?!"
CONVERSATION_2544,"Uh, you've never tried them before?"
CONVERSATION_2545,"This is the first time I've heard they're edible."
CONVERSATION_2546,"My teacher used to make me barbecued spider legs after our training sessions."
CONVERSATION_2547,"Teacher?"
CONVERSATION_2548,"..."
CONVERSATION_2549,"Um, we should talk later."
CONVERSATION_2550,"I think those spiders have spotted us."
CONVERSATION_2551,"Don't you dare come closer! I'll burn you all!"
CONVERSATION_2552,"There's quite a lot of them. Be careful, everyone."
CONVERSATION_2553,"Are you really gonna eat them..."
CONVERSATION_2554,"Ewww! There are too many!"
CONVERSATION_2555,"I should burn them all at once!"
CONVERSATION_2556,"Yay! Good riddance!"
CONVERSATION_2557,"You almost burned us, too."
CONVERSATION_2558,"She doesn't know how to control herself..."
CONVERSATION_2559,"But that was great!"
CONVERSATION_2560,"All those spiders at once..."
CONVERSATION_2561,"Kasel, watch out!"
CONVERSATION_2562,"Kasel! Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_2563,"Eek! A spider THAT BIG?!"
CONVERSATION_2564,"Luckily, he just passed out. He should be okay."
CONVERSATION_2565,"It's not really my style to be out in front, but I guess I don't have a choice."
CONVERSATION_2566,"Not bad for a spider."
CONVERSATION_2567,"Let's see if it can still get me."
CONVERSATION_2568,"Amazing! He's dodging all of its attacks!"
CONVERSATION_2569,"Roi may not look like much, but"
CONVERSATION_2570,"he's pretty well-known at the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2571,"If you have time for chitchat, can you help me?"
CONVERSATION_2566_P,"Urgh! There's no end to them."
CONVERSATION_2567_P,"Let's see if you can still get me!"
CONVERSATION_2568_P,"Amazing! He's dodging all the attacks!"
CONVERSATION_2569_P,"Roi may not look like much,"
CONVERSATION_2570_P,"but he's pretty well-known at the Tower of Sage."
CONVERSATION_2571_P,"If you have time for chitchat, can you help me?"
CONVERSATION_5156,"Amazing, Mr. Roi. Where did you learn those flashy moves?"
CONVERSATION_2579,"Well, let's just say I picked up a little here and there."
CONVERSATION_5157,"Kasel, did you say you had a teacher? What kind of person was he?"
CONVERSATION_2582,"His name was Brian. He used to be Captain of the Royal Guards."
CONVERSATION_2583,"Used to be? That's past tense."
CONVERSATION_2584,"Was he fired?"
CONVERSATION_2585,"..."
CONVERSATION_2586,"He passed away."
CONVERSATION_2587,"Oh, I'm sorry."
CONVERSATION_5158,"It's okay."
CONVERSATION_2590,"How did it happen?"
CONVERSATION_2591,"It's okay. My teacher Brian was..."
CONVERSATION_2592,"He was murdered by a group of assassins."
CONVERSATION_2593,"Assassins...?!"
CONVERSATION_2594,"I still can't forget that day."
CONVERSATION_2595,"Those bastards in white masks...!"
CONVERSATION_2596,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_2597,"One day I'll find him and... !"
CONVERSATION_2598,"Kasel, calm down."
CONVERSATION_5159,"I'm sorry..."
CONVERSATION_5160,"Brian was like a father to me."
CONVERSATION_5161,"He taught me that hatred will only destroy me, but..."
CONVERSATION_5162,"I've still got a long way to go."
CONVERSATION_5163,"No, you're doing well, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5164,"Haha. I got a bit worked up there, but it's all in the past. Come on. Let's go, shall we?"
CONVERSATION_5165,"Let's go, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5166,"Yes. Roi and Cleo, let's get going!"
CONVERSATION_5167,"Roi..."
CONVERSATION_2610,"Roi, the assassins Kasel mentioned earlier must be..."
CONVERSATION_2611,"... Yes, they were probably the Laughing Masks."
CONVERSATION_2612,"Just as I thought..."
CONVERSATION_2613,"Hey, you so look serious. What are you talking about?"
CONVERSATION_2614,"...!"
CONVERSATION_2615,"Oh, nothing. Hee hee hee."
CONVERSATION_2616,"Huh?"
CONVERSATION_2617,"..."
CONVERSATION_2618,"Look! Mushrooms!"
CONVERSATION_2619,"Please don't overcook them this time, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_2620,"Huh? Y-yes! Let this Archmage take care of those mushrooms! Hahaha!"
CONVERSATION_2621,"They summon thorns from the ground and inflict damage in a wide area. Don't let your guard down."
CONVERSATION_2622,"Well noted. I'll keep that in mind."
CONVERSATION_2623,"No, just well done..."
CONVERSATION_2624,"Are you thinking to eat those Muhrooms, too?"
CONVERSATION_2625,"Argh, those thorny muhrooms..."
CONVERSATION_2626,"The others might get sucked into the attack..."
CONVERSATION_2627,"I should draw their attention!"
CONVERSATION_2628,"Kasel! So reckless!"
CONVERSATION_2630,"If I do this, their attacks won't hurt other people!"
CONVERSATION_2633,"Kasel! You were too reckless just now! Why did you jump into the Muhrooms like that?"
CONVERSATION_2634,"I thought it was the only way to keep everyone safe."
CONVERSATION_2635,"Still, that was very dangerous!"
CONVERSATION_5171,"Frey, what Kasel did was very appropriate for the situation."
CONVERSATION_5171_1,"We could have been the ones lying on the ground if he hadn't done that."
CONVERSATION_5172,"But he could have had himself killed!"
CONVERSATION_5173,"Situations like this occur frequently in a real battle."
CONVERSATION_5174,"Don't you think you're treating Kasel like a kid?"
CONVERSATION_5175,"I can't help but worry..."
CONVERSATION_5176,"Don't worry, Frey. I'm pretty sturdy, you know."
CONVERSATION_5177,"Look who's talking. Those Muhrooms just kicked your butt."
CONVERSATION_5178,"We're all safe and sound now. That's what matters."
CONVERSATION_5179_1,"Hahaha. He seems alright. Otherwise, he wouldn't talk that way."
CONVERSATION_5179,"Ah, I don't see any monsters to fight anymore. Let's get going."
CONVERSATION_2644,"Ugh, poison!"
CONVERSATION_2645,"I can block it!"
CONVERSATION_2646,"Huh? How are you going to do that?"
CONVERSATION_2647,"I've never been able to do it before, but..."
CONVERSATION_2648,"I heard that I can create a shield if I focus my divine powers."
CONVERSATION_2649,"It worked!"
CONVERSATION_2650,"Wow, I feel much better..."
CONVERSATION_2651,"Thank you, Frey!"
CONVERSATION_2652,"That was amazing."
CONVERSATION_2653,"It's time for me to do my part!"
CONVERSATION_2654,"Frey, that was awesome!"
CONVERSATION_2655,"I didn't know whether this would work, either."
CONVERSATION_2656,"I never thought to create magic shields using divine powers."
CONVERSATION_2657,"Humph! I was good, too!"
CONVERSATION_2658,"See? Look at those toasted muhrooms!"
CONVERSATION_2659,"Oh, no, you burnt them again..."
CONVERSATION_2660,"Ewww, don't show it to me!"
CONVERSATION_2661,"Kasel, you can't shove things like that into a lady's face."
CONVERSATION_2662,"Muhrooms taste better than they look..."
CONVERSATION_2663,"By the way, Kasel,"
CONVERSATION_2664,"were you there when your teacher was assassinated?"
CONVERSATION_2665,"Yes. Brian hid me in the closet before it happened."
CONVERSATION_2666,"There was nothing I could do but hide when the assassins killed him."
CONVERSATION_2667,"So sad..."
CONVERSATION_2668,"He protected me."
CONVERSATION_2669,"I wouldn't be alive today if they knew there was a witness."
CONVERSATION_2670,"But, why did they come after Brian?"
CONVERSATION_2671,"I don't know. No one had a grudge against him."
CONVERSATION_2672,"And the Captain of the Royal Guards is not one to be targeted easily..."
CONVERSATION_2673,"..."
CONVERSATION_2663_1,"What are you thinking about, Roi?"
CONVERSATION_2664_1,"... Ah, I just remembered something. The leader of the Laughing Masks mentioned it during the executive meeting."
CONVERSATION_2665_1,"It was something about the guard captain of Orvel and his young pupil."
CONVERSATION_2666_1,"I don't know all the details since I wasn't involved in that.. but.."
CONVERSATION_2667_1,"Then, there's nothing to worry about, is there? You didn't kill Kasel's master yourself."
CONVERSATION_2668_1,"That doesn't change the fact that I used to be one of them."
CONVERSATION_2669_1,"But...!"
CONVERSATION_2670_1,"Roi, Cleo, is everything okay? "
CONVERSATION_2671_1,"Ah, Kasel..."
CONVERSATION_2672_1,"You two were here for quite some time. I just came by to see if everything's alright."
CONVERSATION_2672_2,"You seem troubled, both of you... Are you feeling okay?"
CONVERSATION_2673_1,"Ah, n-no, we're alright. I was just saying maybe I overused mana today."
CONVERSATION_2674,"Hush. Be quiet."
CONVERSATION_2675,"?"
CONVERSATION_2676,"I know you are there! Show yourself!"
CONVERSATION_2677,"Keen as always."
CONVERSATION_2678,"I never thought you'd be traveling with that kid, Roi."
CONVERSATION_2679,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_2680,"That mask is..."
CONVERSATION_2681,"What's wrong, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5180,"It's them! The white-masked assassins that killed my master!"
CONVERSATION_5181,"Speak of the devil, huh...?"
CONVERSATION_5182,"Roi, do you happen to know them?"
CONVERSATION_5183,"Well, well, well, Roi. You haven't told your friends about your identity yet?"
CONVERSATION_5184,"Ah, that's right! An assassin is not supposed to reveal his true identity."
CONVERSATION_5185,"Not until your mission to kill them has been completed. Hehehe..."
CONVERSATION_5186,"An assassin?! What are you talking about?!"
CONVERSATION_5187,"You still don't get it, do you, kid?"
CONVERSATION_5188,"Roi was once one of us, the Laughing Masks!"
CONVERSATION_5189,"Is this true? Roi!"
CONVERSATION_5190,"......"
CONVERSATION_2696,"What on earth happened to you, Roi?"
CONVERSATION_2697,"You used to be called the 'Dark Reaper,' but now you're babysitting these punk kids."
CONVERSATION_2698,"Get to the point. Are you here to execute me for leaving?"
CONVERSATION_2699,"I'd be happy to do it right now, but..."
CONVERSATION_2700,"Unfortunately, today's goal is to see to that punk knight, not you."
CONVERSATION_2701,"Me?"
CONVERSATION_2702,"An assassination order for Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_2703,"Hmph, I don't have anything to tell for someone who's about to die."
CONVERSATION_2704,"Here he comes!"
CONVERSATION_2707,"It looks like your skills haven't rusted yet, Roi."
CONVERSATION_2708,"You'll need another century before you can beat Roi! Humph!"
CONVERSATION_2709,"You did all this just because of an apprentice knight."
CONVERSATION_2710,"Talk. What was the order? Why are you after Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5191,"Now, Roi. You know better than that. The Laughing Masks don't answer questions."
CONVERSATION_5192,"Of course, there is no way you would talk."
CONVERSATION_5193,"Then, I will have to force you to!"
CONVERSATION_5194,"Keh heh... Let's spare that talk for some other time, shall we?"
CONVERSATION_5195,"See you again, kiddos!"
CONVERSATION_5196,"Stop!"
CONVERSATION_5197,"Don't go after him, Kasel. It might be a trap."
CONVERSATION_5198,"Don't you dare stop me! Do you even know how I felt when I lost him? He was like a father to me!"
CONVERSATION_5198_1,"You were one of them after all!"
CONVERSATION_5199,"Then I will stop you, Kasel. You can't go!"
CONVERSATION_5200,"I can't let you put yourself in danger either. If you want to go, you will have to take me down too!"
CONVERSATION_5201,"I'm sorry for what I said, Roi. That came out before I..."
CONVERSATION_5202,"You're no fun, Kasel! Just throw those facts at his face like you were doing so moments ago!"
CONVERSATION_5203,"Haha... Could you please forget that part?"
CONVERSATION_5204,"Nope. I was rather relieved."
CONVERSATION_5205,"I had nothing to do with the death of your teacher, Brian."
CONVERSATION_5206,"But I felt guilty for being related to the group that killed him."
CONVERSATION_5202_1,"What I said was too harsh... forgive me for what I said, Roi. My anger got the best of me."
CONVERSATION_5203_1,"But..."
CONVERSATION_5204_1,"... Anyone would do and say the same. You lost an important person in your life."
CONVERSATION_5205_1,"Maybe I had nothing to do with his death,"
CONVERSATION_5206_1,"but the truth doesn't change. I was one of those scumbags who hurt people for their own selfish reasons."
CONVERSATION_5207,"What kind of a group is the Laughing Masks?"
CONVERSATION_5208,"Consider them a typical group of assassins."
CONVERSATION_5208_1,"They take requests and kill people. They have a lot to hide."
CONVERSATION_5209,"Do they have something like a secret hiding place?"
CONVERSATION_5210,"... They move their bases regularly to make it difficult to track them down."
CONVERSATION_5211,"I know a place where I trained when I was young, but as far as I know, it's just an abandoned house now."
CONVERSATION_5212,"but I never went out, so I still don't know where it's located."
CONVERSATION_5213,"I see."
CONVERSATION_5214,"Sorry I can't help you."
CONVERSATION_5215,"They will come back, won't they?"
CONVERSATION_5216,"They will. They don't let their prey live for long."
CONVERSATION_5217,"Umm... I have something to ask you, Roi."
CONVERSATION_5217_1,"You seem to have lived as an assassin since you were young. Why did you leave the Laughing Masks?"
CONVERSATION_5217_2,"And how did you become Cleo's escort?"
CONVERSATION_5217_3,"Those are some pretty big questions."
CONVERSATION_5217_4,"I'm sorry if you feel like I'm interrogating you, but I don't think I can trust you that easily."
CONVERSATION_5217_5,"After all, you were, at one point, one of the people who were trying to kill Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5217_6,"So, I need to know what kind of person you are."
CONVERSATION_5218,"... I can't go into all of the details."
CONVERSATION_5219,"Like most who deal in the shadows, they have secrets, ones they don't want others to know about."
CONVERSATION_5220,"You can't expect them to give you a hearty farewell party when you leave, can you?"
CONVERSATION_5221,"I was branded a traitor. They chased me and attacked me for countless nights..."
CONVERSATION_5221_1,"That was when Dominics, Cleo's master, helped me out."
CONVERSATION_2764,"Dominics the Great Sage!"
CONVERSATION_2765,"Do you know him?"
CONVERSATION_2766,"He's a great sage who once was a court wizard. I heard he's been living quietly at the Tower of Sage."
CONVERSATION_2767,"Humph! That old man is nothing great compared to me!"
CONVERSATION_2768,"Not that I've ever beaten him, but..."
CONVERSATION_2769,"So, Dominics saved my life, and I decided to pay him back."
CONVERSATION_2770,"Though I have no idea how that oath became an order to look after this tomboy."
CONVERSATION_2771,"Who's a tomboy?"
CONVERSATION_2772,"Haha!"
CONVERSATION_5222,"I'm not a tomboy!"
CONVERSATION_2787,"Okay, stubborn lady."
CONVERSATION_2788,"Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2789,"Hahaha...."
CONVERSATION_5223,"Why would the Laughing Masks come after me?"
CONVERSATION_5224,"Perhaps... Was it me that they were trying to kill that day when Brian died?"
CONVERSATION_5225,"If it was, Brian was... Because of me..."
CONVERSATION_5226,"No, it can't be... That can't be right..."
CONVERSATION_158,"Huh? Aren't those goblins?"
CONVERSATION_5227,"Strange. This place doesn't seem like where goblins would choose to live."
CONVERSATION_5228,"I agree. They normally don't step outside of their territory. I wonder why they're here."
CONVERSATION_5229,"They normally do not step outside of their territory. I wonder why they're here."
CONVERSATION_5230,"The goblins may have seen the expedition. Could you go ask them, Frey?"
CONVERSATION_5231,"Wait. Goblins don't take it nicely when someone bigger than them approaches."
CONVERSATION_5232,"I advise you not to make an approach so carelessly."
CONVERSATION_5233,"Haha, don't you worry."
CONVERSATION_5234,"It's true that Goblins are sensitive,"
CONVERSATION_5235,"but I don't think they'll harm us unless we attack them first."
CONVERSATION_5236,"They will not fear a priestess from the Lua Order."
CONVERSATION_5237,"Hmm. The Lua Order must have a lot of free time to show such mercy to goblins."
CONVERSATION_5238,"Miss Cleo, goblins are precious children of the Goddess Lua, too."
CONVERSATION_5239,"You shouldn't speak so thoughtlessly."
CONVERSATION_5240,"Wow, you seem to know a lot about goblins."
CONVERSATION_5241,"I ran into them quite a few times when I was doing relief activities back in the day."
CONVERSATION_5241_1,"Please wait here."
CONVERSATION_5241_2,"Hello, goblin friends! Can I ask you a que-"
CONVERSATION_5242,"Humans? Argh! Humans! Humans disrespect us!"
CONVERSATION_5243,"Oh, the mood seems pretty sour here."
CONVERSATION_5244,"We no scared anymore! We show you we strong!"
CONVERSATION_5245,"Kyaaa!"
CONVERSATION_5246,"Get your hands off Frey!"
CONVERSATION_5247,"Soft..."
CONVERSATION_5248,"Is that where you rest your head?"
CONVERSATION_5249,"What are you waiting for, you two? Aren't you going to fight back!?"
CONVERSATION_5250,"Such silly thoughts! I need to snap out of it."
CONVERSATION_5251,"I-I'm coming! Hi-yah!"
CONVERSATION_5252,"Oh! A stronger hi-yah than the usual!! Get rid of them all, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5253,"Or was that a hi-yah to hide his embarrassment..."
CONVERSATION_5254,"Okay. So much for Frey thinking goblins are the precious children of Lua."
CONVERSATION_5255,"That was pretty wild, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5256,"Those who attack travelers for no reason deserve to be punished!"
CONVERSATION_5257,"Something's wrong. They're usually not this aggressive."
CONVERSATION_5258,"The situation is difficult to understand, for sure."
CONVERSATION_5259,"If goblins are this aggressive, they could've attacked the troops, too."
CONVERSATION_5260,"That's a possibility."
CONVERSATION_5261,"But I doubt an expedition made up of Orvelian Royal Knights would have been defeated by goblins."
CONVERSATION_5262,"Of course."
CONVERSATION_5263,"However, the real problem is.."
CONVERSATION_5264,"If those goblins keep rampaging about,"
CONVERSATION_5265,"it's only a matter of time before they trample and erase all the traces of the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5266,"No way..!"
CONVERSATION_5267,"And what remaining traces may belong to the goblins, not the Expedition."
CONVERSATION_5268,"Then, the only way to be sure is to ask the goblins, right?"
CONVERSATION_5269,"What, Frey? Are you still thinking about talking to the goblins after all we've been through?"
CONVERSATION_5270,"It's inappropriate to assume every goblin is bad."
CONVERSATION_5271,"We should try to talk first, and then use force if things don't work out."
CONVERSATION_5272,"I mean, we can tie them up with ropes and get them to talk."
CONVERSATION_5273,"and drag the truth out of them in time one way or another!"
CONVERSATION_5274,"You're smiling while saying that..? How creepy.."
CONVERSATION_5275,"Well, that doesn't seem like a bad idea."
CONVERSATION_5276,"Shall we go? I hope the next goblin we meet is a nice one."
CONVERSATION_5277,"That'll be good for the goblin, too."
CONVERSATION_5278,"They look like they are ready to fight. I guess we'll have to go into the hard way."
CONVERSATION_5279,"It's too bad we didn't get to meet a nice one."
CONVERSATION_5280,"I guess we can't ask questions during the battle, right?"
CONVERSATION_5281,"No, we will have to subdue all the small ones, and then interrogate the boss!"
CONVERSATION_5279_1,"It would've been great if we could lower our weapons and talk this through,"
CONVERSATION_5280_1,"but that doesn't seem to be the case."
CONVERSATION_5281_1,"Let's clear the area first. Then we can find the one that we can talk to."
CONVERSATION_5282,"Great. Shall we begin?"
CONVERSATION_2817,"Hmm.. They're unexpectedly well equipped."
CONVERSATION_2818,"Goblins are goblins though!"
CONVERSATION_2819,"I see some kind of light over there!"
CONVERSATION_2820,"Are those... flames?"
CONVERSATION_2821,"Could there be a goblin that uses fire magic?"
CONVERSATION_2822,"How rude! You just compared my fire magic to that crap!"
CONVERSATION_2823,"I doubt it. It looks like a flame coming out of a machine."
CONVERSATION_2824,"Come to think of it, my old goblin friend liked to meddle with machinery."
CONVERSATION_2825,"who also liked to play with machines."
CONVERSATION_2825_1,"A goblin friend, huh? It's surprising that you made friends with a goblin."
CONVERSATION_2825_2,"Let's say that it was a rare occasion."
CONVERSATION_2826,"That's awesome!"
CONVERSATION_2827,"What's so great about machines like that one?"
CONVERSATION_2828,"They smell greasy, make noises... To top it all, they're dirty!"
CONVERSATION_2829,"I think it's called 'preferences'."
CONVERSATION_2831,"Can I use one of those, too?"
CONVERSATION_2832,"I don't want one, but I am curious about its structure."
CONVERSATION_2830,"I can see that they're not going to let us just through."
CONVERSATION_2831,"Can I use one of those, too?"
CONVERSATION_2832,"I don't want one, but I am curious about its structure."
CONVERSATION_2833,"My fire is much more amazing than that crap!"
CONVERSATION_2834,"I will blast them all to dust!"
CONVERSATION_5283,"Wait, Miss Cleo! We must catch them alive!"
CONVERSATION_2835,"Damn! It's hot!"
CONVERSATION_2836,"That fire is annoying..."
CONVERSATION_2837,"Kasel! Knock that one down!"
CONVERSATION_2838,"My dagger is no good, but I think your broad sword should do the trick."
CONVERSATION_2839,"Ok, I got it!"
CONVERSATION_2840,"Whew! Now we can catch our breath."
CONVERSATION_2841,"No, not yet!"
CONVERSATION_2842,"The goblins will start shooting fire again when they get up."
CONVERSATION_2843,"Then you can knock him down every time?"
CONVERSATION_2844,"I can't do this every so often..."
CONVERSATION_5284,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5285,"I got you!"
CONVERSATION_5286,"Kyak!"
CONVERSATION_5287,"Have you encountered an expedition group recently?"
CONVERSATION_5288,"Expedition group? What that?"
CONVERSATION_5289,"I think 'expedition group' is probably too difficult for the goblins to understand."
CONVERSATION_5290,"How should I put it.. like a group of humans wearing steel armor?"
CONVERSATION_5291,"Armed humans? I saw! They head east!"
CONVERSATION_5292,"Are you sure?"
CONVERSATION_5293,"No lie! Truth!"
CONVERSATION_5294,"Huh? You mean your battle formation wasn't ready?"
CONVERSATION_5295,"Kyak!"
CONVERSATION_5296,"I guess you're right."
CONVERSATION_5297,"Why did you attack us?"
CONVERSATION_5298,"Humans. Ignore. Reject us."
CONVERSATION_5299,"We stronger now. Ach, no run more from humans!"
CONVERSATION_5300,"Kingdom! Ack, take over! "
CONVERSATION_5301,"Gas full, take now!!"
CONVERSATION_5302,"Urgh!"
CONVERSATION_5303,"Kekekekek!!"
CONVERSATION_5304,"That little monster!"
CONVERSATION_5305,"Kasel, are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_5306,"I'm okay. So, I guess the goblins and expedition never clashed into each other."
CONVERSATION_5307,"Well, I don't know about now though. "
CONVERSATION_5307_1,"The goblins are wreaking havoc all over the area. There's going to be an encounter sooner or later."
CONVERSATION_5308,"Clause..."
CONVERSATION_5309,"Don't worry. Frey."
CONVERSATION_5310,"As clumsy as he may seem, he is known as the 'Knight of Iron Defense' among the Royal Knights."
CONVERSATION_5311,"Ho! He's that good?"
CONVERSATION_5312,"Yes, I'm concerned about the others of the group though."
CONVERSATION_5313,"We should hurry."
CONVERSATION_2861,"Mr. Roi. Did you say you had a goblin friend?"
CONVERSATION_2862,"Kind of, yes."
CONVERSATION_2863,"Heh heh! A goblin friend. That's unusual."
CONVERSATION_2864,"They probably became friends because Roi looks like a goblin!."
CONVERSATION_2865,"So, you became friendly with slimes because you look like one, too?"
CONVERSATION_2866,"Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2867,"Hahaha."
CONVERSATION_2868,"He was peculiar indeed, even among goblins."
CONVERSATION_2869,"As a goblin with albino-white skin, he was shunned by the other goblins."
CONVERSATION_2870,"I rescued him once, when he was being chased by the others. That was the start of our friendship."
CONVERSATION_2871,"Wow! It's surprising to see that Roi cares about others."
CONVERSATION_2872,"You... how many times have I saved you?"
CONVERSATION_2873,"I saved you, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2874,"Hah!"
CONVERSATION_2875,"Haha. Do you still see that goblin friend of yours?"
CONVERSATION_2876,"No, it's been a while since I've seen him."
CONVERSATION_2877,"He locked himself away to make a custom hand cannon, Lakrak MK-1 or something,"
CONVERSATION_2878,"and hasn't been seen since."
CONVERSATION_2879,"You seem to remember the name clearly enough."
CONVERSATION_2880,"Huh? Do you hear explosions?"
CONVERSATION_5600,"Could it be the expedition fighting the goblins?"
CONVERSATION_5601,"Let's go find out, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2883,"Okay! Let's go right away!"
CONVERSATION_2884,"It's that way!"
CONVERSATION_2885,"Huh? What's that over there?"
CONVERSATION_2886,"Umm... A white goblin?"
CONVERSATION_2887,"Who, you!? Why steal my prey!?"
CONVERSATION_2888,"Prey?"
CONVERSATION_2889,"Who interfere will pay! Ach! Blow up all!"
CONVERSATION_2890,"Hmm? Lakrak?"
CONVERSATION_2891,"Huh? You know my name?"
CONVERSATION_2892,"Ach, no matter! All you blow up!!"
CONVERSATION_2893,"I just remembered. He was always like this..."
CONVERSATION_2894,"Kyak! Stop, stop! Ach, sorry!"
CONVERSATION_2895,"You, what! Ach, you why so strong!"
CONVERSATION_2896,"Heh, you still shoot first and think later, don't you, Lakrak?"
CONVERSATION_2897,"Eyak? Roi?"
CONVERSATION_2898,"Yes. It's been a while."
CONVERSATION_2899,"Why don't you fix that full-steam-ahead tunnel vision of yours?"
CONVERSATION_2900,"Kya, kyak! Long time, no see, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2901,"Ewww! A goblin..."
CONVERSATION_2902,"Is this your goblin friend you were talking about earlier?"
CONVERSATION_2903,"Yes. His name is Lakrak."
CONVERSATION_2903_1,"He was alienated from the rest of the goblins because of his white skin."
CONVERSATION_2903_2,"We became friends after I saved him from getting bullied."
CONVERSATION_2903_3,"Wow! It's surprising to hear about Roi caring for others."
CONVERSATION_2903_4,"You... Do you have any idea how many times I saved your life?"
CONVERSATION_2904,"Kya kyak! You with bullet I shoot, but you okay, ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2905,"Ach, tough ones I like!!"
CONVERSATION_2906,"Being sturdy doesn't mean bullets are not painful, but okay..."
CONVERSATION_2907,"Anyway, why were you fighting here?"
CONVERSATION_2908,"I test new weapon and some goblins attack me! So, I test my new weapon on them!"
CONVERSATION_2909,"So, that was the reason.."
CONVERSATION_2910,"And today! Ach! Shoot Goblins! Shoot humans!!"
CONVERSATION_2911,"Good result, ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2912,"Hahaha.."
CONVERSATION_2913,"Gunpowder more I need! Fix I go!"
CONVERSATION_2914,"Hey!"
CONVERSATION_2915,"Later see you!! Ach!"
CONVERSATION_2916,"He's gone."
CONVERSATION_2917,"Yeah, he was always like that."
CONVERSATION_2918,"I was flustered by his attack when we were only trying to rescue him."
CONVERSATION_2919,"Yeah, yeah! Such a rude goblin!"
CONVERSATION_2920,"I'll apologize in his stead. I'm sorry."
CONVERSATION_2921,"Since everyone is okay, that should be fine, right?"
CONVERSATION_2922,"I'm not okay, but..."
CONVERSATION_2923,"Still! I definitely hate goblins!"
CONVERSATION_2924,"Why don't we take a break for a while? Seems like everyone is exhausted."
CONVERSATION_2925,"Everyone seems pretty exhausted."
CONVERSATION_2926,"Agreed. I see some tough-looking goblins ahead of us."
CONVERSATION_2927,"It'd be wise for us to get some rest and regroup."
CONVERSATION_2928,"Great. I feel a little bit tired from all the fighting."
CONVERSATION_2929,"Then, let's take a break and move again."
CONVERSATION_2944,"Hmm? I think I hear a familiar voice."
CONVERSATION_2945,"You do? I can't hear it since it's so noisy in front of us."
CONVERSATION_2946,"Kya kyakyak! My custom hand cannon, Lakrak MK-1! Ach, how taste?!!"
CONVERSATION_2947,"Kyak! You, Lakrak! Ach, Why here?"
CONVERSATION_2948,"You bother me! Taste my new weapon!"
CONVERSATION_2949,"That's definitely the Lakrak we met yesterday."
CONVERSATION_2950,"So, the guards were lax because of this guy."
CONVERSATION_2951,"Can't we just slip away while they're fighting?"
CONVERSATION_2952,"He's doing a great job fighting them all by himself!"
CONVERSATION_2953,"But we can't pretend we didn't see him. We have to help him."
CONVERSATION_2954,"Huh? Kasel, I think that goblin over there might be the leader."
CONVERSATION_2955,"He's wearing different armor, and he's a lot bigger than others!"
CONVERSATION_2956,"He must be controlling this area."
CONVERSATION_2957,"I don't think Lakrak can handle him alone."
CONVERSATION_2958,"Eeeek. Do we really have to go?"
CONVERSATION_2959,"Then why don't you just wait for those goblins who are running this way to capture you."
CONVERSATION_2960,"Fine, I'm coming!!"
CONVERSATION_2961,"Kyak! Again you, steal prey! Ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2962,"We were just passing by."
CONVERSATION_2963,"Go pass by, ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2964,"That one mine!"
CONVERSATION_2965,"Kekek, who you catch?!"
CONVERSATION_2966,"Kyak! Marrik!"
CONVERSATION_2967,"This time only, him you catch!! Kyak!!"
CONVERSATION_2968,"Not because you're afraid of him?"
CONVERSATION_2969,"Kyak! Lakrak no afraid!!"
CONVERSATION_2970,"My cannon power, show you!!"
CONVERSATION_2971,"Kyak! Your cannon, block with shield!!"
CONVERSATION_2972,"What you do, ach!! Front go stand!!"
CONVERSATION_2973,"..."
CONVERSATION_2974,"I told you we should just leave..."
CONVERSATION_2975,"I know. We should've listened to you."
CONVERSATION_2976,"Come, kyak!!"
CONVERSATION_2977,"Kyak! Master Bodakka..."
CONVERSATION_2978,"Kyak! I get!!"
CONVERSATION_2979,"No, it was me who got him!"
CONVERSATION_2980,"No! No! Me! Cannon exploded and...!"
CONVERSATION_2981,"That's not true! It was MY FLAME that exploded last and...!"
CONVERSATION_2982,"Great conversation..."
CONVERSATION_2983,"Well, we can move forward now so that's good for us."
CONVERSATION_2984,"By the way, he mentioned Boddakka just now..."
CONVERSATION_2985,"Marrik! Who Bodakka!"
CONVERSATION_2986,"Bodakka who is?"
CONVERSATION_2987,"Kyak! You I know no know him!"
CONVERSATION_2988,"A great goblin Bodakka, ach! Dark Lord power!"
CONVERSATION_2989,"True boss. Him lead us!!"
CONVERSATION_2990,"Nonsense! I no heard that name before!"
CONVERSATION_2991,"Liar!"
CONVERSATION_2992,"Yakyak! Cannon put away! Truth tell ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2993,"Master Bodakka true leader! Kyak! He unite us!"
CONVERSATION_2994,"Unite one strong tribe! Ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2995,"Tell us more about how he gained the power of the Dark Lord!"
CONVERSATION_2996,"Bodakka strong! Very strong! Only Dark Lord make you so strong!"
CONVERSATION_2997,"So, Bodakka the Dark Lord!! Ach!"
CONVERSATION_2998,"That's not even worth listening to."
CONVERSATION_2999,"Kyakyak! Bodakka you all---!!"
CONVERSATION_3000,"Shut up ach!"
CONVERSATION_3001,"Enough test today. I go now! Yak!"
CONVERSATION_3002,"See later! Ach!"
CONVERSATION_3003,"Lakrak!"
CONVERSATION_3004,"Another disruptive departure."
CONVERSATION_3005,"A goblin Dark Lord~!? It can't be true!! Hahahaha!!"
CONVERSATION_3006,"Well, I think it's true that Bodakka is their leader."
CONVERSATION_3007,"part of what he said could be true "
CONVERSATION_3008,"that Bodakka is leading the goblins."
CONVERSATION_3009,"If we put him down, the goblins here might scatter."
CONVERSATION_5314,"Then, all we have to do is to find the expedition group and capture the goblin, Bodakka!"
CONVERSATION_3017,"You say it like it's nothing."
CONVERSATION_3018,"Well, what do you expect of someone on the same level as a goblin."
CONVERSATION_3019,"I'm not!"
CONVERSATION_TU_140,"Kasel, look!"
CONVERSATION_TU_141,"A temple in a place like this?"
CONVERSATION_TU_142,"I've never heard of any temples around here."
CONVERSATION_TU_143,"A temple that even a priestess has never heard of? Hmm."
CONVERSATION_5315,"Let's go check that place out. We may find some clues about the expedition."
CONVERSATION_TU_145,"What is this place..?"
CONVERSATION_TU_146,"I have no idea. I didn't know this temple existed."
CONVERSATION_5316,"This place is the Hall of Heroes, a place where only true heroes may enter."
CONVERSATION_TU_148,"Wow!"
CONVERSATION_5317,"My name is Hillia, the one who awaits for someone who would become a hero in the future.."
CONVERSATION_5318,"I am waiting for a hero who would face the darkness inside and emerge victorious."
CONVERSATION_5319,"Only those who win the battle against their own darkness mayst become heroes."
CONVERSATION_TU_152,"Face the darkness inside and emerge victorious...?"
CONVERSATION_5602,"You must be... Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_157_1,"H-how do you know my name?"
CONVERSATION_5320,"The path is one of hardship..."
CONVERSATION_5321,"To continue your journey, you must overcome this ordeal."
CONVERSATION_5322,"And, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_157,"Uh, how do you know my name?"
CONVERSATION_5323,"Thou shouldst pass this ordeal now."
CONVERSATION_5324,"Where thou art headed is full of hardships."
CONVERSATION_5325,"A path of hardships... Iris the Great Priestess clearly advised me..."
CONVERSATION_5326,"to protect him from succumbing to darkness."
CONVERSATION_5327,"Are you prepared to meet your challenge and become a hero?"
CONVERSATION_5328,"I'm a little busy right now..."
CONVERSATION_5329,"No, Kasel. You must do it now."
CONVERSATION_5330,"Huh? But the expedition..."
CONVERSATION_5331,"If Kasel overcomes this ordeal, will you shed light on his path?"
CONVERSATION_5332,"Of course. Frey, the priestess who follows the path of light."
CONVERSATION_5333,"What am I supposed to do?"
CONVERSATION_5334,"You must enter the Room of Ordeals in the Hall of Heroes."
CONVERSATION_5335,"To open the Room of Ordeals, each hero needs fragments that fit them."
CONVERSATION_5336,"When you submit the required number of fragments, the Room of Ordeals will open,"
CONVERSATION_5337,"and you will face the darkness inside of you."
CONVERSATION_5338,"Kasel, you have defeated your own darkness."
CONVERSATION_5339,"Yes. I suppressed the horrible thing, and this thing came out."
CONVERSATION_5340,"Now, you must take it to the Room of Purification."
CONVERSATION_5341,"When you purify the darkness, you will finally awaken"
CONVERSATION_5342,"and gain another light."
CONVERSATION_5343,"T-this power is..."
CONVERSATION_5344,"What's it like? Is it really that amazing?"
CONVERSATION_5345,"Yes. I feel so much stronger!"
CONVERSATION_5346,"Can I do it, too, Hillia?"
CONVERSATION_5347,"Of course, Child of Fire."
CONVERSATION_5348,"All who open the door with the correct amount of fragments shall face the darkness within them."
CONVERSATION_5349,"You can make your magic stronger by overcoming the ordeal."
CONVERSATION_5350,"Where can I get the fragments from?"
CONVERSATION_5351,"What do you think money is for?"
CONVERSATION_5352,"Excuse me?"
CONVERSATION_5353,"My apologies. A ghostly spirit just invaded my mouth, so I had to exorcise it."
CONVERSATION_5353_1,"You can find fragments in special places all over the world."
CONVERSATION_5354,"You will discover them one by one during your journey."
CONVERSATION_5355,"And, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5356,"The one you're looking for and the one that's looking for you are both at the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5357,"The World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_5358,"We have to go north to get to the World Tree!"
CONVERSATION_5359,"Let's hurry!"
CONVERSATION_5360,"Thank you, Hillia."
CONVERSATION_5361,"See you soon! I'll come back when I've collected my fragments to purify my darkness, too!"
CONVERSATION_5362,"There are two ways to getting to the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5363,"The north and the west..."
CONVERSATION_5364,"What is the distance?"
CONVERSATION_5365,"Similar."
CONVERSATION_5366,"Then, we should go west. For some reason, the goblins are gathering to the north."
CONVERSATION_5367,"If we want to reach the World Tree quickly, it's be better to deal with fewer enemies, even though it makes me nervous."
CONVERSATION_5368,"Cool. Then let's head to north."
CONVERSATION_265,"Hiyaa!"
CONVERSATION_266,"Urk... You're pretty strong for a human!"
CONVERSATION_267,"You're pretty good for a child!"
CONVERSATION_268,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_269,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_270,"Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_271,"What are you doing here?"
CONVERSATION_5369,"Where are all the other members of the expedition!? Why are you fighting alone!?"
CONVERSATION_5370,"All the other humans ran away."
CONVERSATION_5371,"What?!"
CONVERSATION_5372,"Hmm, I don't recall inviting this little kid knight!"
CONVERSATION_275,"Step back, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5373,"Even Frey is here.."
CONVERSATION_276,"Who is this old woman!"
CONVERSATION_277,"Oh, my... We've got too many uninvited guests. I'll have to do put some of you down."
CONVERSATION_278,"Too many uninvited guests."
CONVERSATION_279,"Don't ruin our fun. We're having a good time."
CONVERSATION_280,"I guess I need to clean up some of this mess."
CONVERSATION_281,"Damn it, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_282,"Run!"
CONVERSATION_283,"You can't beat her!"
CONVERSATION_284,"Where are you looking at, knight?"
CONVERSATION_285,"I'm the one you want!"
CONVERSATION_5374,"Damn it.. at this rate..."
CONVERSATION_5375,"Those two, they're not like any other enemies we've fought before."
CONVERSATION_5376,"What should I do? At this rate, Clause is.."
CONVERSATION_5376_1,"No! I can't lose him here!"
CONVERSATION_5376_2,"Frey, Cleo, and Roi... Please lend me your strength."
CONVERSATION_5376_3,"This will be a tough battle, but please, I need your help."
CONVERSATION_5376_4,"I need to save Clause!"
CONVERSATION_5377,"Well said, Kasel! Who else other than this archmage will help you when you're in trouble?"
CONVERSATION_5378,"Clause is family to me as well. I won't let him get hurt!"
CONVERSATION_5379,"Gah, escorting this tomboy is a lot more tiring than I ever expected."
CONVERSATION_5380,"Be careful. Like Kasel said, they're quite strong."
CONVERSATION_288,"The four of you kids are going to stand against me? How adorable~"
CONVERSATION_289,"Okay, children. I'll play along. Just don't die too quickly, okay?"
CONVERSATION_5381,"Argh!"
CONVERSATION_5382,"Kasel, no!"
CONVERSATION_5383,"Oh, is that it? I was just starting to get excited."
CONVERSATION_5384,"Stand up, children. You can do better than this, can't you?"
CONVERSATION_5385,"Gah... R-run way, everyone. I'll stop her..!"
CONVERSATION_5386,"Don't be ridiculous! How can I leave you when you can't even stand up!"
CONVERSATION_5387,"I haven't seen anything this powerful... Is this the power of demons?"
CONVERSATION_5388,"Pull yourself together, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5389,"Do you want to die here?"
CONVERSATION_5390,"Tsk, this is boring. I was a fool to think I could have a little fun out of this."
CONVERSATION_5391,"I'm bored now, kids. Now die."
CONVERSATION_5392,"And don't blame me too much, okay? Fufufu!"
CONVERSATION_5393,"No... I can't give up like this..."
CONVERSATION_5394,"Clause... Everyone I dragged into this... I must protect them with my life!"
CONVERSATION_5395,"Even if I die here, I have to stop them!"
CONVERSATION_5396,"Can't let them die. Have to get up... even if it kills me!"
CONVERSATION_5397,"Wh-what is this?"
CONVERSATION_5398,"Some energy is coming from the deep down inside.."
CONVERSATION_5399,"I can feel it..."
CONVERSATION_5400,"An immense power that I've never felt before!"
CONVERSATION_5401,"That sword is...!"
CONVERSATION_331,"Oh no..."
CONVERSATION_332,"This kid...!"
CONVERSATION_333,"Maria!"
CONVERSATION_334,"Move out of the way, knight!"
CONVERSATION_335,"Yikes!!"
CONVERSATION_336,"Are you all right, Maria!"
CONVERSATION_5402,"I'm fine, Morrah."
CONVERSATION_5403,"Hmph, I've discovered something unexpected and interesting."
CONVERSATION_5404,"Let's back off for today. It's going to be even more entertaining from now on..."
CONVERSATION_341,"Are you running away?"
CONVERSATION_342,"Not exactly 'running away'.. but we will let you live this time."
CONVERSATION_5405,"We will meet again soon."
CONVERSATION_5406,"We may even join forces, who knows?"
CONVERSATION_5407,"Don't make me laugh! Who'd be your ally, hag?"
CONVERSATION_5408,"Hey, wizard chick. I really should thank you."
CONVERSATION_5409,"You reminded me of an old friend of mine who used to cast fire magic."
CONVERSATION_5410,"The memory of my old friend who was a fire sorceress just like yourself."
CONVERSATION_5411,"Even so, I thought about killing you..."
CONVERSATION_5412,"For now, I'll let you live. Live until you meet me, again."
CONVERSATION_5413,"Next time we meet, you'll either have to join me or die."
CONVERSATION_5414,"See you later. Ahahaha.."
CONVERSATION_5415,"Wait! Hey you! You hag!"
CONVERSATION_5416,"Tell me more.. I want to hear more about it..."
CONVERSATION_5417,"Ugh..."
CONVERSATION_5418,"Are you all right, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5419,"Huh! Clause? You're still alive!"
CONVERSATION_5420,"What about Frey? Are Cleo and Roi okay, too?"
CONVERSATION_5421,"I'm here."
CONVERSATION_5422,"We owe you our lives, too, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5423,"What about the witch and the servant demon girl?"
CONVERSATION_5424,"They ran away."
CONVERSATION_5425,"What! Are you sure!? You guys are awesome!!"
CONVERSATION_5426,"You're so strong, Clause, Cleo, Roi!!"
CONVERSATION_5427,"Frey sure did her best, as our only priestess!"
CONVERSATION_5428,"I feel pathetic, being the only one to pass out."
CONVERSATION_5429,"What are you talking about, Kasel? You saved all of us."
CONVERSATION_5430,"Excuse me?"
CONVERSATION_5431,"Don't you remember? It was awesome!! The sword started to shine, even though it was just for a moment."
CONVERSATION_5432,"And you defeated two powerful demons with only a few attacks."
CONVERSATION_5433,"And the sword changed its appearance before we realized it."
CONVERSATION_5417_1,"Is it over..?"
CONVERSATION_5418_1,"Kasel, you were amazing! You dominated those two like it was nothing!"
CONVERSATION_5419_1,"There was a flash of light every time you swung your sword! It was like a bolt of lightning."
CONVERSATION_5420_1,"By the way, Kasel, since when did you attain that power?"
CONVERSATION_5421_1,"Flash of light? Power? What are you talking about, Clause?"
CONVERSATION_5422_1,"What do you mean? Don't you remember what you did when you fought off the witch?"
CONVERSATION_5423_1,"I... All I was thinking was that I had to save everyone."
CONVERSATION_5424_1,"Then, I felt something surging inside me. After that... I don't remember."
CONVERSATION_5425_1,"I should say.. I was feeling... dazed? Like I was doing what that energy was leading me to do."
CONVERSATION_5426_1,"Speaking of which, you're now holding a different sword as well."
CONVERSATION_5434,"Oh? This sword is.."
CONVERSATION_5435,"Wait a minute. T-this can't be..."
CONVERSATION_5436,"The Holy Sword Aea?"
CONVERSATION_5437,"Yes! That is the Holy Sword Aea, the one that defeated the Dark Lord Angmund long ago!"
CONVERSATION_368,"Wow!"
CONVERSATION_369,"Wh-what?"
CONVERSATION_5438,"Oops! I was so excited I jumped out of nowhere!"
CONVERSATION_5439,"Sorry. I am the World Tree Fairy, Rhill."
CONVERSATION_5440,"A World Tree Fairy? I mean, what is this Holy Sword doing in my hands?"
CONVERSATION_5441,"Of course, it's there because it chose you."
CONVERSATION_5442,"Huh? I believe that last owner of the Holy Sword was Kyle, a warrior king that lived 100 years ago."
CONVERSATION_5443,"Because it belongs to you."
CONVERSATION_5444,"No, the holy sword belongs to King Kyle...."
CONVERSATION_5445,"Kyle was also the one chosen by the holy sword, ever since he was born."
CONVERSATION_5446,"Then... that means Kasel was also..."
CONVERSATION_5447,"Yes. Kasel was also fated to be with the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5448,"I'm just an apprentice knight. I could never dream of living the same destiny as King Kyle..."
CONVERSATION_5449,"The holy sword first emerged during the time of King Kyle, when the demons raided into the world."
CONVERSATION_5450,"There is no evidence that it only chooses kings."
CONVERSATION_5451,"That's right. I also do not know how the holy sword chooses its master."
CONVERSATION_5452,"As the World Tree Fairy, all I've been doing is watching over this sealed holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5453,"But the holy sword in front of you is not whole, yet."
CONVERSATION_5454,"Before King Kyle's companions sealed the holy sword inside the World Tree,"
CONVERSATION_5455,"they shared the power of Lua that was imbued in the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5456,"You have to collect this power, and return it to the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5457,"You should meet the Elves at Elidora Forest first."
CONVERSATION_5458,"So, what you are saying Kasel is, he needs the power of the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_5459,"Yes. The fact that the holy sword revealed itself after being sealed for a long time means"
CONVERSATION_5460,"it realizes the world is in need of its power."
CONVERSATION_5461,"That means...the holy sword must have had various masters before me."
CONVERSATION_5462,"It just had no reason to reveal itself."
CONVERSATION_5463,"In other words, the holy sword existed even before the time of king Kyle,"
CONVERSATION_5464,"but it may have only revealed itself to protect the world from the demons."
CONVERSATION_5465,"Certainly sounds plausible."
CONVERSATION_5466,"Fate. I don't like this subject."
CONVERSATION_5467,"Anyway, I don't see Cleo. Where has she gone?"
CONVERSATION_5468,"Ah, the kid has her own issues, too."
CONVERSATION_5469,"Then, let's go to find her."
CONVERSATION_5470,"I will have to thank her for the time we spent."
CONVERSATION_5471,"No, you don't need to do that."
CONVERSATION_5472,"Kasel and Frey have to help us from now on."
CONVERSATION_5473,"Hah. Not us. You mean just you."
CONVERSATION_5474,"I heard your story."
CONVERSATION_5475,"Considering that witch has some business with you..."
CONVERSATION_5476,"I will stick around with you."
CONVERSATION_5477,"You need to see her again?"
CONVERSATION_5478,"Hah... It's going to take forever explaining. Can we go for a short walk?"
CONVERSATION_5449_1,"I also don't know how the Holy Sword chooses its master."
CONVERSATION_5449_2,"As the World Tree Fairy, all I've been doing was watching over this sealed Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5449_3,"The Holy Sword is unstable now, though."
CONVERSATION_5449_4,"It's because Kyle and his comrades shared its power before sealing it away."
CONVERSATION_5449_5,"You will have to find the scattered power of the Holy Sword to make it complete."
CONVERSATION_5449_6,"Go to Elidora Forest. There, you will learn what you'll have to do."
CONVERSATION_5450_1,"Since the Holy Sword has chosen Kasel as its master, there's no backing out now, huh?"
CONVERSATION_5451_1,"After its long sleep, the Holy Sword has finally appeared."
CONVERSATION_5451_2,"This means that it knows when it's needed, and who it belongs to."
CONVERSATION_5452_1,"(I.. called for the power of the Holy Sword..? I just wanted to keep everyone safe...)"
CONVERSATION_5453_1,"What do you say, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5453_2,"Destiny or not, what really matters is what you decide to do from now on."
CONVERSATION_5454_1,"I-I'm not sure. This is happening all too fast..."
CONVERSATION_5455_1,"Yeah, I feel you.. it's a lot to take in."
CONVERSATION_5455_2,"You should think carefully before making a decision."
CONVERSATION_5456_1,"Thank you for your kind words..."
CONVERSATION_5457_1,"By the way, is everything okay with Cleo? She hasn't been looking so well for some time."
CONVERSATION_5458_1,"Umm..."
CONVERSATION_5458_2,"Wake up now, Cleo. The witch is gone."
CONVERSATION_5459_1,"I know..."
CONVERSATION_5460_1,"I don't think you do. It's not like you to get stuck in the past."
CONVERSATION_5460_3,"Feeling so down over the past... You're letting down all the people who know you as a tomboy."
CONVERSATION_5461_1,"Roi, you!"
CONVERSATION_5462_1,"Hahaha. That's the Cleo everyone knows."
CONVERSATION_5463_1,"Shut up!"
CONVERSATION_5464_1,"You'll meet the witch again, sooner than you think."
CONVERSATION_5464_2,"She said that she'd come for us. There's no need to fret over it."
CONVERSATION_5465_1,"Hmph!"
CONVERSATION_5466_1,"*Giggle* Even though you talk that way to Cleo, you really seem to care a lot about her."
CONVERSATION_5467_1,"*Sigh* Like I said before, that's a joke I never want to hear again."
CONVERSATION_5468_1,"Same here. I'll burn your mouth with magic!"
CONVERSATION_5469_1,"Hahaha!"
CONVERSATION_5470_1,"Umm... Roi, Cleo. Thank you for helping me, then. I really appreciate it."
CONVERSATION_5470_2,"You helped me meet Clause again."
CONVERSATION_5470_3,"Thank you. You've done a lot for my little brother and sister."
CONVERSATION_5471_1,"There is no need for you to thank us."
CONVERSATION_5471_2,"That witch had some deep interest in you. I think I'll hang around you a little longer."
CONVERSATION_5472_1,"Huh? What do you mean?"
CONVERSATION_5473_1,"... I don't even know anymore..."
CONVERSATION_5479,"So, Cleo is looking for her mother,"
CONVERSATION_5480,"and the witch seemed to know about her mother,"
CONVERSATION_5481,"and now, she wants to be with me to see the witch again."
CONVERSATION_5482,"Then, do you want this sword, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5483,"Oh! Oh! Are you sure? If I may, I'm sure I can collect the power of the holy sword much faster than you!"
CONVERSATION_5484,"Kasel! You can't hand off your holy sword to anyone!"
CONVERSATION_5485,"The holy sword will not give its strength to anyone but its chosen master."
CONVERSATION_TU_231,"Humph! What a petty sword."
CONVERSATION_TU_232,"Hahaha! Funny little girl!"
CONVERSATION_TU_233,"Little girl?! I'll have you know I am a great sorceress from the Tower of the Sage!"
CONVERSATION_TU_234,"The Holy Sword Aea is not like other weapons."
CONVERSATION_TU_235,"It grows stronger when the owner becomes stronger."
CONVERSATION_5486,"Excuse me? Is this rude knight coming with us?"
CONVERSATION_5487,"Hahaha. I apologize, little sorceress."
CONVERSATION_5488,"I have something I need to do, too."
CONVERSATION_5486_1,"So, Cleo is looking for her mother, "
CONVERSATION_5486_2,"and the witch seemed to know something about her?"
CONVERSATION_5487_1,"Right. It happens that the witch is after you,"
CONVERSATION_5487_2,"so it'll be easier for us to meet that witch again if I stick with you."
CONVERSATION_5488_1,"... I haven't decided what I should do yet."
CONVERSATION_5488_2,"I'll have to do something when she shows up again, but..."
CONVERSATION_5489_1,"Argh, come on, Kasel! Stop being so indecisive and make up your mind."
CONVERSATION_5489_2,"Whether you like it or not, the witch will come back. You can't be so wishy-washy now."
CONVERSATION_5490_1,"Cut it out, Cleo. It's Kasel's decision."
CONVERSATION_5491_1,"But..."
CONVERSATION_5492_1,"Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5493_1,"... Tsk. Okay, okay. I got it!"
CONVERSATION_5494_1,"Hahaha, two trusted comrades, taking good care of Kasel! As a brother, I'm glad for you!"
CONVERSATION_5495_1,"Hmph! What are you so happy about?"
CONVERSATION_5496_1,"Well now, lady. Don't be so harsh on him. Kasel only came here to see if his brother was fine."
CONVERSATION_5496_2,"However, he now has to decide whether he'll have to become the master of the Holy Sword or not. Anyone would be confused in this situation."
CONVERSATION_5497_1,"I know that! I'm just frustrated..."
CONVERSATION_5498_1,"Hahaha, okay, little lady."
CONVERSATION_5499_1,"Don't you call me little lady! I'm the archmage of the Tower of Sage, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5500_1,"Understood, little wizard."
CONVERSATION_5489,"I said I'm an archmage!"
CONVERSATION_5490_1_P,"Calm down, Cleo. And you too, Clause."
CONVERSATION_5491_1_P,"Hahaha, I'm sorry."
CONVERSATION_5491_2_P,"Anyway... I think it's time we get back to business."
CONVERSATION_5492_1_P,"You mean the leader of the goblins?"
CONVERSATION_5493_1_P,"It's always best to nip the problem in the bud."
CONVERSATION_5494_1_P,"Well said."
CONVERSATION_5495_1_P,"I'll join you, Clause."
CONVERSATION_5495_2_P,"As a knight, I can't let goblins hurt people."
CONVERSATION_5496_1_P,"Ooh, you've really grown!"
CONVERSATION_5496_2_P,"Okay, we'll finish this off quickly!"
CONVERSATION_5490,"So are you going to capture the goblin boss that is taking over King's Plains?"
CONVERSATION_5491,"Kasel. You have a smart companion."
CONVERSATION_5492,"People who are a bit dense like yourself need smart friends."
CONVERSATION_5493,"No, I'm his smartest AND strongest companion!"
CONVERSATION_5494,"Hahaha. I understand, little sorceress."
CONVERSATION_5495,"You keep adding 'little' every time you refer to me! Little!"
CONVERSATION_5496,"Do you want see what the fire of a great sorceress can do to you?!"
CONVERSATION_5497,"Miss Cleo, throwing fire over such a trivial topic isn't a good idea."
CONVERSATION_5498,"Oh, uh...that's true."
CONVERSATION_5499,"Damn goblins! I, the great sorceress, will rain fire on you."
CONVERSATION_5501,"Clause?"
CONVERSATION_5502,"Frey. You're up, too."
CONVERSATION_5503,"Are you here for Kasel? Did the Great Priestess send you?"
CONVERSATION_5504,"How did you know?"
CONVERSATION_5505,"The Great Priestess visited me the night before the expedition left."
CONVERSATION_5506,"She knew we were headed in this direction, so she asked me to protect the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5507,"Was that the reason you were fighting alone while everyone else was running away?"
CONVERSATION_5508,"I couldn't just let the demons bring chaos into our world like this."
CONVERSATION_5509,"To tell you the truth, we were ordered to fall back when the witch attacked us."
CONVERSATION_5510,"But... I just couldn't."
CONVERSATION_5511,"Yes.. She said the same words to me, too. She said I would face hardships with him"
CONVERSATION_5512,"and that I had to help him on his journey so he would not sink into the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5513,"A path of hardships."
CONVERSATION_5510_1,"I had this feeling that I would lose people that I care about"
CONVERSATION_5510_2,"if I failed to keep the World Tree safe."
CONVERSATION_5510_3,"Then, I realized that might have been the reason why the Great Priestess told me to protect the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5511_1,"By people that you care about, you mean..."
CONVERSATION_5512_1,"Surprisingly, Kasel was one of the first to come to mind."
CONVERSATION_5512_2,"Of course, you, Grandpa, and all the brothers and sisters mean the world to me."
CONVERSATION_5512_3,"But strangely, I had this image of Kasel stuck in my mind that time... I couldn't think about anyone else."
CONVERSATION_5513_1,"Clause..."
CONVERSATION_5514,"Hah. When she asked me to protect the World Tree,"
CONVERSATION_5515,"I thought I might be the one that the Holy Sword would choose as its master."
CONVERSATION_5516,"I never expected Kasel would be the one to shoulder such a heavy burden..."
CONVERSATION_5517,"I never expected it would be a burden for Kasel to shoulder."
CONVERSATION_5518,"If I had known, I would've just followed the order to retreat."
CONVERSATION_5519,"No, You did well, Clause."
CONVERSATION_5520,"You did what you were supposed to do with the guidance of Lua."
CONVERSATION_5521,"Haha. You've become a true priestess, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5522,"I know this isn't something I should say in front of a priestess like you, Frey,"
CONVERSATION_5523,"but I am quite resentful that the goddess burdened Kasel with such hardship."
CONVERSATION_5524,"..."
CONVERSATION_5525,"There will be another battle tomorrow. Let's go inside, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5526,"Well, anyway. Bodakka, was it? The leader of the goblins?"
CONVERSATION_5527,"Once we get rid of him and the goblins are no longer a threat,"
CONVERSATION_5528,"I will return to Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5529,"Take care of Kasel while I'm gone."
CONVERSATION_5530,"Don't worry."
CONVERSATION_5531,"I am Lua's chosen one."
CONVERSATION_5532,"I'll do my best to protect Kasel from succumbing to darkness."
CONVERSATION_5533,"The defense seems tight here, more than elsewhere."
CONVERSATION_5534,"This looks like the Goblins' base."
CONVERSATION_5535,"So, is Bodakka here?"
CONVERSATION_5536,"I heard this goblin Bodakka runs around on a boar."
CONVERSATION_5537,"If that's a fact, it might be easier for us to spot him among the others."
CONVERSATION_5538,"Really? That sounds like fun! I want to meet him quickly!!"
CONVERSATION_5539,"Where did you get all this information?"
CONVERSATION_5540,"It's a method... that I wouldn't share with a priestess."
CONVERSATION_5541,"We got rid of their leader. They won't be a threat to us for a while."
CONVERSATION_5542,"No, wait."
CONVERSATION_5543,"Doesn't it look like the ones that were scattered are all gathering in one place?"
CONVERSATION_5544,"What?"
CONVERSATION_5545,"Hmm... There must still be something that's uniting the goblins as one."
CONVERSATION_5546,"Let's try to think positively."
CONVERSATION_5547,"They may end up showing us what they're hiding."
CONVERSATION_5548,"I hope that is the case, but... "
CONVERSATION_5603,"Let's move. We can see what this is all about,"
CONVERSATION_5604,"and decide what to do with them later."
CONVERSATION_5604_1,"Well.. Doesn't sound bad."
CONVERSATION_5604_2,"All right. Then, let's move."
CONVERSATION_5549,"Kasel, didn't we sense this feeling before?"
CONVERSATION_5550,"Yes... It's oddly familiar..."
CONVERSATION_5550_1,"Right! It's similar to what I felt in the Hall of Heroes!"
CONVERSATION_5551,"That's right! It's like when we opened the Door of Ordeals!"
CONVERSATION_5552,"But there's something different about it."
CONVERSATION_5552_1,"If the Door of Ordeals was a big, flat piece of glass,"
CONVERSATION_5552_2,"this place feels like it has small pieces of glass scattered all over it."
CONVERSATION_5553,"Small pieces of glass..."
CONVERSATION_5554,"Ah! Could this be what Hillia mentioned before?"
CONVERSATION_5555,"She said fragments could be found in special places of the world."
CONVERSATION_5556,"If we have a chance, let's check if there really are fragments in this place."
CONVERSATION_5557,"Good idea."
CONVERSATION_5558,"Apparently we can find the fragments we need for the awakening here."
CONVERSATION_5559,"We should say our good-byes here, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5560,"We've finished off Bodakka and found where the gunpowder storage is located."
CONVERSATION_5561,"I have to go back to the capital and hand in my report."
CONVERSATION_5562,"Oh! I had something to finish in Orvel, too."
CONVERSATION_5563,"That stupid Roi messed up all my plans as soon as I arrived in Orvel..."
CONVERSATION_5564,"Then we can go together. We should hurry."
CONVERSATION_5565,"Wait, are you going to leave without this great sorceress?"
CONVERSATION_5566,"There must be another way ..."
CONVERSATION_5567,"Oh, Miss Cleo! Do you mean you can open a portal?"
CONVERSATION_5568,"Portal?"
CONVERSATION_5569,"Hah! Totally!! We can get back to where we were in no time!"
CONVERSATION_5570,"We should really say goodbye, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5571,"It was so good to see you return safely."
CONVERSATION_5572,"We came home together, but now it's your turn to leave."
CONVERSATION_5573,"I can't help the fact that I was chosen to do this. I know I have to go."
CONVERSATION_5574,"I will join you as soon as I finish things here."
CONVERSATION_5575,"Sounds like the Knighthood is more liberal than I thought."
CONVERSATION_5576,"Well, if not, I can submit a request to be dispatched."
CONVERSATION_5577,"If all else fails, I can just drop out of the knighthood."
CONVERSATION_5578,"That's another liberty to be able to drop out anytime anywhere."
CONVERSATION_5579,"Wait, didn't you say Kasel is a squire?"
CONVERSATION_5580,"Well, nothing has been posted for the squires for 10 days after the expedition left."
CONVERSATION_5581,"Oh, that's right. I need to go through the process of resigning my knighthood."
CONVERSATION_5582,"We are affiliated with the Royal Knights. We can take care of that at the palace."
CONVERSATION_5583,"Now I'm going to the barracks."
CONVERSATION_5584,"Take care of yourself till we meet again, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5585,"And, don't tell anyone about the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5586,"I know. Rumors of the holy sword's resurrection will make the rounds in a jiffy."
CONVERSATION_5587,"It can put Orvel in danger, too."
CONVERSATION_5588,"That's my brother. You are very considerate."
CONVERSATION_5589,"All right. Roi!... And the archmage, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5590,"Please look after Kasel and Frey while I'm away."
CONVERSATION_5591,"Hmm. Suddenly I'm a 'great sorceress' when somebody needs my help!"
CONVERSATION_5592,"Haha, did I say that? Hahah."
CONVERSATION_5593,"Fufufu."
CONVERSATION_5594,"Time to go. See you later."
CONVERSATION_5605,"That day..."
CONVERSATION_5606,"I clearly remember that day,"
CONVERSATION_5607,"when nightmarish creatures attacked the village."
CONVERSATION_5608,"I came to realize later that those creatures were Demons."
CONVERSATION_5609,"Like all other villagers that day,"
CONVERSATION_5610,"my parents too, had their lives taken away by those Demons."
CONVERSATION_5611,"I can't recall it well, but I was running into the village."
CONVERSATION_5612,"And I witnessed my mom slowly losing her consciousness from outside the door."
CONVERSATION_5613,"I was so scared and shocked that I couldn't go closer to her."
CONVERSATION_5614,"My mom then saw me, and slowly shambled toward me."
CONVERSATION_5615,"Only then did I cry, bursting loudly into tears."
CONVERSATION_5616,"She grabbed my hands,"
CONVERSATION_5617,"and led me to the loft."
CONVERSATION_5618,"She then distorted a dimension with her hand gestures."
CONVERSATION_5619,"She pushed me in there, and my memory ends there."
CONVERSATION_5620,"Before pushing me into that dimension,"
CONVERSATION_5621,"she definitely said something to me."
CONVERSATION_5622,"Maybe I was out of my mind with fear.. I still don't recall her words to this day."
CONVERSATION_5623,"But there's one thing I clearly remember..."
CONVERSATION_5624,"It's her face when she bid me goodbye..."
CONVERSATION_5626,"When you go to the Northeast, you will be able to meet the elf druid who possesses part of the holy sword's power."
CONVERSATION_5627,"Eh!? Since when were you following us?"
CONVERSATION_5628,"When I saw you headed towards the Elidora Forest at the World Tree,"
CONVERSATION_5629,"I rushed here to guide you."
CONVERSATION_5630,"I can't stray too far from the World Tree. I can direct you only a little further."
CONVERSATION_5631,"First, go straight to the East."
CONVERSATION_5632,"This forest is bigger than I had expected. Wish there's some kind of a milestone..."
CONVERSATION_5633,"Rill, Rhill or whatever that fairy's name was, I think it lied to us."
CONVERSATION_5634,"I'm not seeing any 'clear' path here. All I see are trees and weeds."
CONVERSATION_5635,"Hmm? I'm seeing a road to the north."
CONVERSATION_5636,"Look at this, a flat pathway. Not bad."
CONVERSATION_5637,"What's so special about a flat pathway?"
CONVERSATION_5637_1,"This could mean that a lot of animals and people stroll on it."
CONVERSATION_5637_2,"Ohhh, does that mean this could be a legit path?"
CONVERSATION_5637_3,"Pretty much."
CONVERSATION_5637_4,"Still, we should be careful."
CONVERSATION_5637_5,"It's risky to let our guard down when we don't know anything about this area yet."
CONVERSATION_5638,"Is that.. a ghost...?"
CONVERSATION_5639,"This is odd. We had a pack of wolves attacking us, and now even ghosts..."
CONVERSATION_5640,"You're right. I don't sense any irregular magical power from them though.."
CONVERSATION_5641,"Watch out, Kasel. Physical Attacks are of no use against that spectral wolf."
CONVERSATION_5642,"Oh no. Then I have no means to—"
CONVERSATION_5643,"Hehe~ Don't worry. Ghosts are nothing to the archmage like me! Let me care of them!"
CONVERSATION_5644,"Ehehehe..."
CONVERSATION_5645,"Feels like I'm the one stuck with drawing the short straw..."
CONVERSATION_5646,"No, you're not!"
CONVERSATION_5647,"I'm telling you again, the holy sword belongs to you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5648,"I wonder if you have considered the efforts of a fairy trying to safekeep something that isn't even theirs."
CONVERSATION_5649,"I didn't want the sword to begin with.."
CONVERSATION_5650,"Be proud yourself!"
CONVERSATION_5651,"The Holy Sword Aea is a gift to humanity from the goddess, Lua."
CONVERSATION_5652,"Yes! I want one too! My own, unique weapon!"
CONVERSATION_5653,"Oh, right."
CONVERSATION_5654,"There was an old old saying that other unique weapons beside the holy sword exist."
CONVERSATION_5655,"You might find your own unique weapon someday, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5656,"Really?? Then you should have said so earlier! I didn't know that!"
CONVERSATION_5657,"That's only if you are a world saving hero, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5658,"Hah, Kasel has his unique weapon! Why can't this great sorceress have one?!"
CONVERSATION_5659,"Let's search for it together if possible!"
CONVERSATION_5660,"Everyone, please take care!"
CONVERSATION_5661,"May the blessings of Goddess Lua be with you."
CONVERSATION_5662,"Look, dryads! Wow, I've never seen one before, except in books!"
CONVERSATION_5663,"Dryad?"
CONVERSATION_5664,"They're the sentinels of Elidora Forest."
CONVERSATION_5665,"They are known to be kind and generous to everyone."
CONVERSATION_5666,"Wait, something's not right."
CONVERSATION_5667,"W-what did I just see? Did it just kill one of their own?"
CONVERSATION_5668,"Uh-oh, it spotted us. Looks like we are next."
CONVERSATION_5669,"What's going on here...?"
CONVERSATION_5670,"Discussion later. Let's deal with them first."
CONVERSATION_5671,"Brace yourselves! They're coming!"
CONVERSATION_5672,"Dryads would never say such words!!"
CONVERSATION_5673,"What should we do?"
CONVERSATION_5674,"We are in danger, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5675,"It's my duty to keep you safe. I can't back off from this fight."
CONVERSATION_5676,"The rest of you take care of yourselves."
CONVERSATION_5677,"Then we'll just have to help each other!"
CONVERSATION_5678,"Look, a wounded dryad over there! I think it's still alive..."
CONVERSATION_5679,"Hold on, it could be a trap."
CONVERSATION_5680,"Trap or not, I have to help. As a priest, I cannot let someone die in pain."
CONVERSATION_5681,"Are you alright? Please hang in there. Let me heal—"
CONVERSATION_5682,"D-don't... It's hopeless, give up on me..."
CONVERSATION_5683,"E-elidora Forest is... already corrupted... by darkness."
CONVERSATION_5684,"M-many of us in here... are being c-controlled by... the darkness..."
CONVERSATION_5685,"No... NO!!!"
CONVERSATION_5686,"She's dead..."
CONVERSATION_5687,"Being dominated by dark power? Could that mean..."
CONVERSATION_5688,"What is it? Is there anything you know of?"
CONVERSATION_5689,"I've heard of mind controls, a mean to control beasts such as lions and wolves."
CONVERSATION_5690,"But I didn't expect the same thing would work on the noble intellectual beings such as dryads."
CONVERSATION_5691,"What are you talking about…?"
CONVERSATION_5692,"I may be wrong, but I think it's one of the mind control magics that Demons use."
CONVERSATION_5693,"I'm pretty sure I'm right. That dryad said 'controlled by the darkness.'"
CONVERSATION_5694,"Demons... Perhaps it's a deed of that witch we saw last time?"
CONVERSATION_5695,"That, I'm not too sure. So far, I haven't sensed her magic power."
CONVERSATION_5696,"Then who..."
CONVERSATION_5697,"Kasel, why don't we step back for now? I think it'd be too dangerous to go further."
CONVERSATION_5698,"Especially if that magic is strong enough to corrupt intellectual beings such as dryads,"
CONVERSATION_5699,"controlling humans like us would be a cakewalk."
CONVERSATION_5700,"I agree that this place is dangerous, but that's a hasty decision."
CONVERSATION_5701,"It's not like this place is fully shrouded in darkness that we can't even breathe."
CONVERSATION_5702,"We've only faced packs of wolves and dryads. That's all."
CONVERSATION_5703,"After going through all the troubles, we've finally managed to find the correct path. Why should we step back now?"
CONVERSATION_5704,"I'm afraid I can't accept your decision."
CONVERSATION_5705,"I'm sorry, but if Kasel gets corrupted by the darkness..."
CONVERSATION_5706,"Err... Cleo? How about you? What are your thoughts?"
CONVERSATION_5707,"I did sense power of darkness from the dryad's dead body."
CONVERSATION_5708,"Other than that, I didn't sense any other ominous energy."
CONVERSATION_5709,"If that's the case.. let's keep moving."
CONVERSATION_5710,"Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5711,"Frey, I know what you're worried about, but I must move on."
CONVERSATION_5712,"If Elidora Forest is truly being corrupted by the darkness,"
CONVERSATION_5713,"all the lives of this forest will suffer more and more as time goes."
CONVERSATION_5714,"I believe it's my duty to end this suffering."
CONVERSATION_5714_1,"But..."
CONVERSATION_5714_2,"I'll be fine as long as I have you."
CONVERSATION_5714_3,"I have someone who was sent by the Great Priestess. Nothing could possibly go wrong."
CONVERSATION_5714_4,"Heh, I couldn't have said it better myself."
CONVERSATION_5714_5,"Totally."
CONVERSATION_5714_6,"Okay... Then promise me that you'll be cautious at all times."
CONVERSATION_5714_7,"Like I said before, the power of darkness that lurks within this forest is very dangerous."
CONVERSATION_5714_8,"I will. Don't worry, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5715,"Look at that. That's um... Ents! Looks like they aren't corrupted by the power of darkness."
CONVERSATION_5716,"But they look very angry. I don't think we can pass through here easily."
CONVERSATION_5717,"How dare you defile this holy ground! You shall all be punished for what you've done!"
CONVERSATION_5718,"They must be thinking that we're the cause of the problem. We must clear up the misunderstanding somehow!"
CONVERSATION_5719,"They seem very agitated. Talks aren't enough to solve this problem."
CONVERSATION_5720,"But...!"
CONVERSATION_5721,"As you can see, they are considering us as enemies."
CONVERSATION_5722,"Careless approach will only exacerbate the situation."
CONVERSATION_5723,"They're angry at the sudden spread of corruption."
CONVERSATION_5724,"If battle is inevitable, there will be no choice."
CONVERSATION_5725,"But let's first try to find an ent who's willing to talk."
CONVERSATION_5726,"Hmm.. That sounds like a high-risk gamble to me."
CONVERSATION_5726_1,"I would prefer not to put Cleo in danger as much as possible."
CONVERSATION_5726_2,"Yeah right. Since when did you ever worry about me?"
CONVERSATION_5726_3,"*Sigh* Yeah.. it was foolish of me to even start worrying about you."
CONVERSATION_5726_4,"Anyways, about finding an ent who's open to a talk... I don't think it's possible to check all of them."
CONVERSATION_5726_5,"Since all of them are out their minds, my suggestion would be to subdue them first."
CONVERSATION_5726_6,"Sounds good. Then, let's try to knock them out instead of killing."
CONVERSATION_5726_7,"Roger that."
CONVERSATION_5727,"This is bad."
CONVERSATION_5728,"No matter how many times we put them down, they get back up. There's no end to this."
CONVERSATION_5729,"Ugh, my fire magic would easily finish them. Too bad they're not monsters."
CONVERSATION_5730,"No fire magic this time, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5731,"That would possibly cause a huge forest fire, then all the creatures in the forest would definitely become our foes."
CONVERSATION_5732,"I know, I know... But it's just so frustrating!"
CONVERSATION_5733,"Only if these ents would listen to us..."
CONVERSATION_5734,"Halt!"
CONVERSATION_5735,"Ah, Selene, the Princess of Elves!"
CONVERSATION_5736,"Princess... of Elves?"
CONVERSATION_5737,"Please be at ease, strong-rooted ent friends, for they are not your enemies."
CONVERSATION_5738,"What are you saying, Princess Selene?"
CONVERSATION_5739,"For days we have searched Elidora Forest thoroughly,"
CONVERSATION_5740,"and these beings were the ones with the most outlandish look."
CONVERSATION_5741,"If it's not them, then who might be the ones behind all this?"
CONVERSATION_5742,"Lady Lorraine has found the culprit."
CONVERSATION_5743,"Everything will soon be under control. Now then, please calm yourselves."
CONVERSATION_5744,"The Great Sage has said that? If so, that's a relief!"
CONVERSATION_5745,"(The Great Sage...?)"
CONVERSATION_5746,"Hey uh, sorry for interrupting, but..."
CONVERSATION_5747,"It was really intense a while ago. You ents badly misunderstood us."
CONVERSATION_5748,"Oh, we sincerely apologize for it."
CONVERSATION_5749,"It could have escalated to the point of no return. Please accept our sincerest apology."
CONVERSATION_5750,"Yeah, right! An apology after asking for one! I bet you guys didn't even bother trying to figure out who we were!"
CONVERSATION_5751,"Hey Cleo, I know how you feel, but let's listen to their side of the story first."
CONVERSATION_5752,"We don't have a single clue as to what's going on here, and why the ents acted that way."
CONVERSATION_5753,"Roi is right. They could have approached us with less violence, but that's probably because they care much about this forest."
CONVERSATION_5754,"Also, I believe they can tell us about their troubles. Let's hear them out first, alright?"
CONVERSATION_5755,"Tsk, whatever!"
CONVERSATION_5756,"I do not know the whole story, but it seems our ents have caused you quite a bit of trouble."
CONVERSATION_5757,"It's ok. We're fine after all."
CONVERSATION_5758,"By the way, you mentioned that you now know the culprit behind all this. Were you talking about the darkness that engulfed this forest?"
CONVERSATION_5759,"How did you...? I thought this was not yet known to the outsiders."
CONVERSATION_5760,"Oh, that's..."
CONVERSATION_5761,"I see... So even the dryads have now fallen to the darkness..."
CONVERSATION_5762,"Would you mind telling us what's going on in detail?"
CONVERSATION_5763,"Now that we know the situation, we can help you out if you need our assistance."
CONVERSATION_5764,"Hold on, that's not what we should be worrying about. We don't have time for such matters."
CONVERSATION_5765,"Remember what Rhill said before? Rhill said that we'll find our next destination in the Elidora Forest."
CONVERSATION_5766,"And the ent mentioned something about the 'Great Sage.'"
CONVERSATION_5767,"I assume that person knows something about the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5768,"Oh, so your plan is to help them in return for information about the sword?"
CONVERSATION_5768_1,"Yes. I think it's better to get their help than helplessly wandering around."
CONVERSATION_5768_2,"Why don't we just help, then get help from those who know this place well?"
CONVERSATION_5768_3,"Wow~ you're right! That's smart."
CONVERSATION_5768_4,"Sounds like a plan to me. I'm in."
CONVERSATION_5768_5,"Eh, Roi? You heard all that?"
CONVERSATION_5768_6,"You can say that I'm always all ears."
CONVERSATION_5768_7,"S-sure..."
CONVERSATION_5768_8,"Thank you for your kind words, but I don't think we are desperate enough to seek aid of the out—"
CONVERSATION_5768_9,"I'm sure whatever trouble you are having can be solved quicker with our help."
CONVERSATION_5768_10,"Two is always better than one."
CONVERSATION_5768_11,"Hmm..."
CONVERSATION_5768_12,"Looks like you don't trust us."
CONVERSATION_5768_13,"No, it's not like that at all."
CONVERSATION_5768_14,"Ok then, how about I take you all to the Great Sage for the detailed story? Please follow me."
CONVERSATION_5769,"I, Selene, the Princess of the Elves, have just returned."
CONVERSATION_5770,"These travelers here offered to aid us, so I guided them here."
CONVERSATION_5771,"Please introduce yourselves to our revered druid, Lorraine."
CONVERSATION_5772,"A druid? For real?"
CONVERSATION_5773,"It is an honor to meet you."
CONVERSATION_5774,"I am Kasel from Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_5775,"Welcome, travelers."
CONVERSATION_5776,"The successor of the Holy Sword and his companions... We have valuable guests with us today."
CONVERSATION_5777,"How did you know...?"
CONVERSATION_5778,"Wow! Are all druids that awesome?! She already knows everything!"
CONVERSATION_5779,"That's because I felt the Holy Sword's energy resonating, that's all."
CONVERSATION_5780,"Something I've been keeping for the last hundred years just recognized its master."
CONVERSATION_5781,"The Holy Sword? Lorraine, I do not quite understand this situation."
CONVERSATION_5782,"Your highness, Kasel here is the successor of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5783,"I can feel Lua's light surrounding this man."
CONVERSATION_5784,"W-what have I…!"
CONVERSATION_5785,"Forgive me for not recognizing you! I, Selene, the Princess of the Elves, humbly welcome you to our land."
CONVERSATION_5786,"P-please don't. I'm just an ordinary squire."
CONVERSATION_5787,"No, you are the noble one, chosen by Lua.."
CONVERSATION_5788,"You are the hero who will save us all. The least I can do is to honor your presence."
CONVERSATION_5789,"I-I really don't deserve this..."
CONVERSATION_5790,"By the way, you just said that you have something that you've 'been keeping for the last hundred years.'"
CONVERSATION_5791,"Is this related to the Holy Sword?"
CONVERSATION_5792,"Hmm? Oh, you must be talking about this."
CONVERSATION_5793,"This is a portion of the Holy Sword's power."
CONVERSATION_5794,"We had our reasons to divide the Holy Sword's power 100 years ago."
CONVERSATION_5795,"Normally, I would have given back the power the moment the new master appears."
CONVERSATION_5796,"But I'm afraid I can't at the moment."
CONVERSATION_5797,"Pardon me, the Great Sage, but what exactly is going on here?"
CONVERSATION_5798,"Could you share with us the details of the current situation?"
CONVERSATION_5799,"The Lake of Eternity was the place where the ritual to separate the Holy Sword's power was carried out."
CONVERSATION_5800,"The source of mana that upholds Elidora Forest lies in that lake."
CONVERSATION_5801,"Recently, a powerful dark energy engulfed the whole lake,"
CONVERSATION_5802,"and since that day, the dark energy started corrupting the forest's lifeforms one by one."
CONVERSATION_5803,"I believe someone intentionally planted the Core of Darkness deep inside the lake."
CONVERSATION_5804,"The culprit seems to have left long ago, however."
CONVERSATION_5805,"So that's the reason why gentle dryads turned so violent."
CONVERSATION_5806,"Those who are more sensitive to magic are the ones to be greatly influenced. It is a tragedy..."
CONVERSATION_5807,"If what you're saying is true, then aren't all your elves in danger as well?"
CONVERSATION_5808,"We elves are safe, thanks to the magic barrier cast by Lorraine."
CONVERSATION_5809,"If we are struck by a being corrupted by the power of darkness however, we too, will become corrupted."
CONVERSATION_5810,"How can we help?"
CONVERSATION_5811,"We will go to the Lake of Eternity. There, I want you to help us destroy the Core of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5812,"The Core of Darkness... is it something we can easily destroy?"
CONVERSATION_5813,"We do not know how they planted the Core of Darkness inside the lake,"
CONVERSATION_5814,"but there was no news of Demons appearing near the lake yet."
CONVERSATION_5815,"If we get there quickly, we should be able to destroy the core with ease."
CONVERSATION_5816,"Hmm... Anything else we have to worry about?"
CONVERSATION_5817,"The Lake of Eternity is in harpy's territory. To enter the lake, we must first get permission from the harpies."
CONVERSATION_5818,"But that is not the matter you should be worried about. We elves are on good terms with harpies."
CONVERSATION_5819,"But the Core of Darkness is emitting darkness powerful enough to corrupt those who are kind at heart."
CONVERSATION_5820,"We can't just go to there without a plan—"
CONVERSATION_5821,"That you do not have to worry about."
CONVERSATION_5822,"Haaa!"
CONVERSATION_5823,"This is...!"
CONVERSATION_5824,"This barrier will protect you from the power of darkness."
CONVERSATION_5825,"Dear Great Sage, thank you."
CONVERSATION_5826,"Let's move. We should destroy the core before it corrupts more beings."
CONVERSATION_5827,"Is she coming with us?"
CONVERSATION_5828,"While you destroy the Nucleus of Darkness, I have relief responsibilities to handle."
CONVERSATION_5829,"I need a proper foothold for this."
CONVERSATION_5830,"Could you prescribe something for us so we are not affected by the Nucleus of Darkness?"
CONVERSATION_5831,"Of course. Let's get ready to leave."
CONVERSATION_5832,"Look, dryads. I think they're being hostile to us..."
CONVERSATION_5833,"They also must have been corrupted by the power of darkness."
CONVERSATION_5834,"We can't revert them while they are conscious."
CONVERSATION_5835,"I'm afraid we will have to neutralize them to proceed."
CONVERSATION_5836,"I guess we have no choice. Ok then."
CONVERSATION_5837,"Our paths will separate here. I will find the corrupted ones and heal them."
CONVERSATION_5838,"Your highness, you should go with them to destroy the core."
CONVERSATION_5839,"As you wish, Lorraine."
CONVERSATION_5840,"Successor of the Holy Sword, please take good care of our princess."
CONVERSATION_5841,"I will. Dear Great Sage, please take good care of yourself as well."
CONVERSATION_5842,"I must be dreaming... An adventure with the warrior of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5843,"I am truly honored to be with you, my warrior."
CONVERSATION_5844,"Haha... I, um..."
CONVERSATION_5845,"Err... Frey?"
CONVERSATION_5846,"Hmm?"
CONVERSATION_5847,"Are you okay with that? I think our little Elven Princess has quite a crush on Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5848,"Is she...? I think she's just showing respect as he's the warrior of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5849,"Well if you say so, and I hope that's true. I don't want any drama here."
CONVERSATION_5850,"Love between an elf and a human... Ugh, worst drama ever."
CONVERSATION_5851,"It would be very hard for the couple to overcome the lifespan difference."
CONVERSATION_5852,"Also... Love stories of an elf and a human usually end tragically..."
CONVERSATION_5853,"Uh, Frey?"
CONVERSATION_5854,"..."
CONVERSATION_5855,"Hey, are you ok? Something bothering you?"
CONVERSATION_5855_1,"Oh... No, it's nothing."
CONVERSATION_5855_2,"Come on, let's get moving. They're already over there."
CONVERSATION_5855_3,"Okay."
CONVERSATION_5856,"Now the ents too? Watch out, my warrior. The power of darkness is growing stronger."
CONVERSATION_5857,"Now you mention it... I think the power's getting thick enough that it's hard to breathe."
CONVERSATION_5858,"Goddess Lua, please save these lost and fallen ones with your hand of salvation..."
CONVERSATION_5859,"They're coming. Brace yourselves!"
CONVERSATION_5860,"It's impossible for me to address a princess so casually."
CONVERSATION_5861,"Then can we be friends, too?"
CONVERSATION_5862,"Since we are companions to the Knight."
CONVERSATION_5863,"Of course. Make yourself comfortable when you talk to me, please."
CONVERSATION_5864,"Okay, Selene. Nice to meet you."
CONVERSATION_5865,"We are now in the harpy's territory."
CONVERSATION_5866,"Fortunately, the harpies seem unaffected by the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5867,"Greetings, brave harpy warrior. I am Selene, the Princess of the Elves."
CONVERSATION_5868,"As it happens, we have an important matter to settle in your territory. We would very much appreciate your cooperation."
CONVERSATION_5869,"Understood, noble Princess of the Elves."
CONVERSATION_5870,"But on one condition. We would like you to give us the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5871,"What?"
CONVERSATION_5872,"Huhhh? Are you kidding?! No way!"
CONVERSATION_5873,"If you deny, then we will have to resort to force."
CONVERSATION_5874,"What did you just say?"
CONVERSATION_5874_1,"Hey, you chicken-bird! Stop talking nonsense and show some respect, will ya?"
CONVERSATION_5874_2,"We are here to destroy the Core of Darkness planted inside the lake! We are here to help you guys!"
CONVERSATION_5874_3,"W-what?! Kid, say that again!"
CONVERSATION_5874_4,"How dare an outsider insult the proud harpy warrior! Know your place!"
CONVERSATION_5874_5,"I, Naila, will teach you a lesson!"
CONVERSATION_5874_6,"What?! Is this chicken-bird serious? Who do you think I am?"
CONVERSATION_5874_7,"Bring it on! I'm going to crush you so hard that you will cry for mercy!"
CONVERSATION_5874_8,"Um, Roi? I think Cleo is quite inflamed."
CONVERSATION_5874_9,"Yeah.. Tell me about it…"
CONVERSATION_5875,"Argh..."
CONVERSATION_5876,"Come on, is that all you've got? That was too easy."
CONVERSATION_5877,"You picked the wrong person to mess with. An archmage like myself is too much for you to... Eh?"
CONVERSATION_5878,"W-what are you doing, Roi?"
CONVERSATION_5879,"Let me ask you one thing. How did you know that he has the Holy Sword?"
CONVERSATION_5880,"And what do you intend to do with the Holy Sword?"
CONVERSATION_5881,"It was an order from my queen. She told us that we need the Holy Sword to solve the matter."
CONVERSATION_5882,"She also told us that the successor of the Holy Sword is someone who carries a breeze purer than anyone else,"
CONVERSATION_5883,"therefore it'd be easy for us to find him."
CONVERSATION_5884,"So you knew it by sensing his wind."
CONVERSATION_5885,"Sensing my wind? What does that mean?"
CONVERSATION_5886,"Harpies have an innate ability that allows them to sense the energy of the wind."
CONVERSATION_5887,"Not only does this ability enables them to predict enemy's movement during the battle,"
CONVERSATION_5888,"but also allows them to instinctively sense changes in weather, and baleful omens. "
CONVERSATION_5889,"No wonder. I was surprised that she easily found out that I have the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5890,"Next question. Why is Queen Balalaika after the sword? Why would she need the sword?"
CONVERSATION_5891,"Please help us, Princess Selene. All our kin is going mad."
CONVERSATION_5892,"It seems the Core of Darkness... is now corrupting harpies as well."
CONVERSATION_5893,"Let us hurry. We should go to the Lake of Eternity at once."
CONVERSATION_5894,"Are you... helping us?"
CONVERSATION_5895,"I believe your name was.. Naila? Please guide us to the Lake of Eternity."
CONVERSATION_5896,"Thank you... Thank you so much! I Naila, the harpy warrior, will never forget your deed!"
CONVERSATION_5897,"Princess Selene, do you have a minute?"
CONVERSATION_5898,"Why? What's the matter?"
CONVERSATION_5899,"Relax. I just want to ask you a few questions, nothing more. "
CONVERSATION_5900,"Hmm, to me?"
CONVERSATION_5901,"Remember what that harpy warrior said?"
CONVERSATION_5902,"Her queen wants the Holy Sword to solve the matter."
CONVERSATION_5903,"You're quite a keen one, impressive."
CONVERSATION_5904,"As you know, I did not know that the Holy Sword even existed before I met our warrior."
CONVERSATION_5905,"I thought the warrior would be someone with energy more pure and brilliant than that of ordinary humans."
CONVERSATION_5906,"It is true that the harpies can sense many things with wind,"
CONVERSATION_5907,"but even for them, it's not easy to recognize the Holy Sword without prior knowledge or exposure to it."
CONVERSATION_5908,"I see. So what was the elves' original plan to destroy the Core of Darkness?"
CONVERSATION_5909,"Is there a way to destroy it without using the power of the Holy Sword?"
CONVERSATION_5910,"I do not know much about that. I trust Lorraine, and act as she speaks."
CONVERSATION_5911,"I have faith that, through Lorraine, the Core of Darkness will soon be destroyed, and those who are suffering will be freed as well."
CONVERSATION_5912,"..."
CONVERSATION_5912_1,"Is something wrong? Or is it that you don't trust me?"
CONVERSATION_5912_2,"No, I was just pulling my thoughts together."
CONVERSATION_5913,"I see. Is there anything more you wish to talk about?"
CONVERSATION_5914,"That was more than enough. Thank you for the conversation."
CONVERSATION_5915,"Well then, I'll get going to see the warrior. I shouldn't be away from him for too long."
CONVERSATION_5916,"Okay."
CONVERSATION_5917,"(Hm... It doesn't sound like the princess is lying...) "
CONVERSATION_5918,"(That means the harpy queen must be the one who's lying...)"
CONVERSATION_5919,"(The fact that she knew that her people are going mad, and she had prior knowledge about the Holy Sword...)"
CONVERSATION_5920,"(Moreover, the Holy Sword is not exactly needed to destroy the Core of Darkness...)"
CONVERSATION_5921,"(These two facts are more than enough to say that she wants to lure Kasel and the Holy Sword...)"
CONVERSATION_5921_1,"(But that harpy warrior doesn't seem to know anything about her queen's intention...)"
CONVERSATION_5921_2,"(Argh... This is so obvious, but on the other hand, nothing is perfectly certain yet.) "
CONVERSATION_5921_3,"(I guess I have no choice but to watch how the situation unfolds for now...)"
CONVERSATION_5922,"How could such a thing happen..."
CONVERSATION_5923,"They look like soulless zombies... Is that what the Core of Darkness is capable of?"
CONVERSATION_5924,"Their bodies and minds have succumbed to the power of darkness…"
CONVERSATION_5925,"Naila..."
CONVERSATION_5926,"We have no choice... but to defeat them to move on."
CONVERSATION_5927,"We are almost at the Lake of Eternity."
CONVERSATION_5928,"My sister should be waiting for you at the entrance."
CONVERSATION_5929,"(Waiting for us...?)"
CONVERSATION_5930,"Wait, I have a bad feeling about this. This might be a trap."
CONVERSATION_5931,"Princess Selene, what are you saying? Do you doubt me?"
CONVERSATION_5932,"We elves did not know anything about the Holy Sword before we met our warrior."
CONVERSATION_5933,"But you, the protectors of the Lake of Eternity, already knew about the Holy Sword and have been waiting for us?"
CONVERSATION_5933_1,"We've also seen corrupted harpies on our way here."
CONVERSATION_5933_2,"Sorry to say this, but we have every right to be suspicious."
CONVERSATION_5933_3,"Does that mean you are doubting my sister and all my kin?"
CONVERSATION_5933_4,"Not all harpies are corrupted. Please refrain from suspecting us."
CONVERSATION_5933_5,"What should we do?"
CONVERSATION_5933_6,"Princess Selene has a point, but Naila doesn't look like someone who would lie..."
CONVERSATION_5933_7,"(Princess Selene absolutely has a point...)"
CONVERSATION_5933_8,"(But she is being too direct with her suspicion. This is troublesome...)"
CONVERSATION_5933_9,"Um... Roi?"
CONVERSATION_5933_10,"This is tough. Princess has a point, and I agree with her but..."
CONVERSATION_5933_11,"But it is true that the harpies were acting strangely."
CONVERSATION_5933_12,"And don't forget that chicken-bird one attacked us and tried to forcefully take away the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5933_13,"Hmm... How about you, Kasel. Any thoughts?"
CONVERSATION_5933_14,"I think we should trust Naila."
CONVERSATION_5933_15,"My warrior!"
CONVERSATION_5933_16,"Kasel, are you really sure about that?"
CONVERSATION_5933_17,"If she wanted to trick us, then she wouldn't have fought us directly in the first place."
CONVERSATION_5933_18,"She could've just made us lower our guards, then take away the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5933_19,"But...!"
CONVERSATION_5933_20,"Moreover, Naila put down her own kin to guide us here."
CONVERSATION_5933_21,"Though they were corrupted by darkness, those harpies were her friends and sisters."
CONVERSATION_5933_22,"But us? We are just outsiders to her."
CONVERSATION_5933_23,"I don't think it was an easy decision to attack her own kin to help outsiders."
CONVERSATION_5933_24,"I think that Naila's heart is in the right place. She really wants to save her kin."
CONVERSATION_5933_25,"Human..."
CONVERSATION_5933_26,"Impressive, Kasel. Didn't expect to hear such thoughtful words from you."
CONVERSATION_5933_27,"I know right? Where did our indecisive Kasel at the World Tree go?"
CONVERSATION_5933_28,"Hahaha... I voiced my opinion, that's all."
CONVERSATION_5933_29,"No, Kasel. That was brilliant."
CONVERSATION_5933_30,"Thank you, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5933_31,"Anyways, I think we should make haste. We have no time for more talks."
CONVERSATION_5933_32,"Please lead us the way, Naila."
CONVERSATION_5933_33,"Will do. And thank you so much... human."
CONVERSATION_5934,"Ugh...! Be on your guard, everyone! I feel a strong presence of the power of darkness nearby."
CONVERSATION_5935,"T-this can't be... No! Himmullis!!"
CONVERSATION_5936,"Sister!"
CONVERSATION_5937,"Good to see you here, Naila. Is there something wrong? The look on your face doesn't look so good."
CONVERSATION_5938,"Good to see that you're still okay, Himmullis..."
CONVERSATION_5939,"Wait, don't get any closer!"
CONVERSATION_5940,"Look at them carefully. Their skins are all jet-black! They must be corrupted!"
CONVERSATION_5941,"W-what? No, that can't be..."
CONVERSATION_5942,"My sister is a warrior like me. She would never succumb to darkness!"
CONVERSATION_5943,"Please don't go near them! I can sense malicious power residing within them!"
CONVERSATION_5944,"I know it's hard, but we can't let you get corrupted by the darkness like them!"
CONVERSATION_5945,"Lies... This is all lies... This can't be happening... This can't be...!"
CONVERSATION_5946,"What's wrong, Naila? Come here, my little sister."
CONVERSATION_5947,"Accept this power, and become one of us."
CONVERSATION_5948,"Himmullis... Did you really surrender your all to that vile demonic power?"
CONVERSATION_5949,"Naila, my dearest sister, join me. Let's be embraced by 'him' together."
CONVERSATION_5950,"Pride and tribe... They're nothing but obstacles in our life. Sacrifice your body and your thoughts to him."
CONVERSATION_5951,"He will reward you with the eternal paradise... if you give your all to him."
CONVERSATION_5952,"Himmullis!"
CONVERSATION_5953,"Please stay back. We can't have you slaughter your own sibling."
CONVERSATION_5954,"We... will handle them."
CONVERSATION_5955,"She is.. my sister... If my only sister has been consumed by the darkness,"
CONVERSATION_5956,"it must be I who ends her suffering!"
CONVERSATION_5957,"..."
CONVERSATION_5958,"I know that it's an inevitable fight, but I don't think we—"
CONVERSATION_5959,"We have no other choice but to take her down. Or we'll all be corrupted by the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5960,"Let's get moving then... Let's go and help Naila and the princess."
CONVERSATION_5961,"Kasel..."
CONVERSATION_5962,"but now only death will free you!"
CONVERSATION_5963,"No, Sister!!!"
CONVERSATION_5964,"I've heard enough. Any more hesitation will endanger my Knight."
CONVERSATION_5965,"I agree. Step back if you can't fight your sister, Naila. We will do the rest."
CONVERSATION_5966,"No... This is a battle for myself."
CONVERSATION_5967,"Argh...!"
CONVERSATION_5968,"Himmullis!"
CONVERSATION_5969,"Naila...? Is... that really you...?"
CONVERSATION_5970,"Please save your breath... You are bleeding badly."
CONVERSATION_5971,"I'm glad... to see... that you are not... corrupted by that... power..."
CONVERSATION_5972,"Himmullis...?"
CONVERSATION_5973,"It's... not late yet..."
CONVERSATION_5974,"Turn back... Move far away... from this lake..."
CONVERSATION_5975,"Balalaika... Our queen... has betrayed... us."
CONVERSATION_5976,"She allied herself... with the Demons... for her own... gain..."
CONVERSATION_5977,"To cover her evil deeds... To create slaves... that will do her biddings..."
CONVERSATION_5978,"She... corrupted us... one by one... Now... The Lake of Eternity... She's trying to..."
CONVERSATION_5979,"No, this can't be... Priest! Can you please do something about it?"
CONVERSATION_5980,"..."
CONVERSATION_5981,"I beg you! Please! Save my sister... Save her!"
CONVERSATION_5982,"She's the only family I have...! Please!"
CONVERSATION_5983,"Her soul's completely corrupted..."
CONVERSATION_5984,"A soul consumed by darkness will give birth to another darkness, and corrupt others."
CONVERSATION_5985,"I'm really sorry... but I can't fulfill your request."
CONVERSATION_5986,"W-what? Hey, you...! Isn't it your job as a priest to tend the wounded?"
CONVERSATION_5987,"Don't tell me you're going to neglect a dying life as a priest!"
CONVERSATION_5988,"If I try to purify it by force, the power of darkness will go berserk."
CONVERSATION_5989,"If that happens, all of us here including you, Naila, will become corrupted by the power of darkness."
CONVERSATION_5990,"Worst of all, your sister's mind will not be able to withstand the purification."
CONVERSATION_5991,"I don't think someone dying could endure the horrible pain, the pain like one's whole body being burnt alive."
CONVERSATION_5992,"N-no... I won't accept it! No!"
CONVERSATION_5993,"E-enough... Naila... Do not blame the priest..."
CONVERSATION_5994,"Get out of here... Seek help from... the Great Sage Lorraine..."
CONVERSATION_5995,"I'm sure... she'll be able to... take down Balalaika..."
CONVERSATION_5996,"Himmullis!"
CONVERSATION_5997,"N-naila... Please save... our kin..."
CONVERSATION_5998,"Himmullis...?"
CONVERSATION_5999,"W-wake up Himmullis... Open your eyes... Himmullis... Himmullis!!!"
CONVERSATION_6000,"Oh, dear Lua... please grant peace and respite to Himmullis, for she has suffered much under the influence of the darkness."
CONVERSATION_6001,"No..."
CONVERSATION_6002,"Everything is perfectly clear now. The culprit behind all this was Queen Balalaika."
CONVERSATION_6002_1,"She used you and all the harpies to seek and deliver the Holy Sword to the Demons."
CONVERSATION_6002_2,"Balalaika!!!"
CONVERSATION_6002_3,"What a tragedy..."
CONVERSATION_6002_4,"Using her own kin to fulfill her personal desire? What a shameless queen!"
CONVERSATION_6002_5,"The world is big and full of scums. It will take a while for Naila to recover from all this."
CONVERSATION_6002_6,"I'm actually more worried about Frey. She had no choice but to just watch someone die in front of her eyes... as a priest..."
CONVERSATION_6002_7,"..."
CONVERSATION_6002_8,"Frey, are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_6002_9,"Kasel... I..."
CONVERSATION_6002_10,"I'm so sorry... Things would've been much better if I had more power..."
CONVERSATION_6002_11,"N-no... There's nothing to be sorry about it…"
CONVERSATION_6002_12,"If only.. I was—"
CONVERSATION_6002_13,"You're doing well, Kasel. Don't let this bother you."
CONVERSATION_6002_14,"..."
CONVERSATION_6002_15,"Let's go... We must move on to save the ones who are still suffering from the darkness."
CONVERSATION_6002_16,"Okay..."
CONVERSATION_6003,"Kasel and Frey... They're looking very down."
CONVERSATION_6004,"They'll need some time to get over it. Let's leave them be for now."
CONVERSATION_6005,"My warrior..."
CONVERSATION_6005_1,"Hold, I'm seeing some people. Their numbers are quite large."
CONVERSATION_6005_2,"Hm? I don't see anyone... Are they the corrupted ones?"
CONVERSATION_6005_3,"No, I've never seen anyone like them before... Hmm, they have strange-looking masks on."
CONVERSATION_6005_4,"Strange... looking masks? Those must be...!"
CONVERSATION_6005_5,"Kasel! Wait!"
CONVERSATION_6005_6,"What's with him? Why did he run off like that?"
CONVERSATION_6005_7,"Perhaps he found something...? Let's chase him."
CONVERSATION_6005_8,"As expected. The Laughing Masks!"
CONVERSATION_6005_9,"Darn it, their numbers are too large. Come to think of it, how did they enter here and find us?"
CONVERSATION_6005_10,"It's not easy to search for someone in this maze-like forest."
CONVERSATION_6006,"Is that the Holy Sword? Tsk, looks like we were too late."
CONVERSATION_6006_1,"Why are you here? Are you still after Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_6006_2,"Isn't that obvious? The mission we failed long ago... We're here to finish it."
CONVERSATION_6006_3,"Long... ago? Are you the ones who killed Brian?!"
CONVERSATION_6006_4,"Brian. Ah, now that name brings back old memories."
CONVERSATION_6006_5,"Our mission would've already been done, if it weren't for that meddling geezer."
CONVERSATION_6006_6,"Shut it! Don't you dare say my teacher's name with that foul tongue!"
CONVERSATION_6006_7,"How naive. Hey kid, are you sure about that?"
CONVERSATION_6006_8,"That 'caring and respectful teacher' Brian is just an illusion he instilled into your mind."
CONVERSATION_6006_9,"What...?"
CONVERSATION_6006_10,"Hahahaha! How clueless!"
CONVERSATION_6006_11,"Do you really think he took you as a disciple without a purpose?"
CONVERSATION_6006_12,"From the looks of it, I guess he wanted to look like an upright person, at least to you."
CONVERSATION_6006_13,"However, that doesn't change the fact that he accepted you to cover his past sins."
CONVERSATION_6006_14,"You were just a toy for his repentance!"
CONVERSATION_6006_15,"...Up..."
CONVERSATION_6006_16,"Hmm? What did you just say—"
CONVERSATION_6006_17,"I SAID SHUT UP! I'll kill you all, Laughing Masks!"
CONVERSATION_6007,"N-no... Kasel, no!!"
CONVERSATION_6008,"Kasel! Kasel wait!"
CONVERSATION_6009,"Frey! Wait up!"
CONVERSATION_6010,"What should we do, Roi? I think Frey lost it too!"
CONVERSATION_6011,"Dammit! Let's protect Frey first."
CONVERSATION_6012,"She's the only one who can calm Kasel down!"
CONVERSATION_6013,"I will kill you all.. Just like how you killed my teacher!"
CONVERSATION_6014,"Ahhhhhh!"
CONVERSATION_6015,"Ugh...! What on earth was... Huh? Hey Frey!"
CONVERSATION_6016,"Dang it, what an immense power...!"
CONVERSATION_6017,"Time to end this, Laughing Masks!"
CONVERSATION_6018,"You took Brian's life, and insulted him. For that, you will pay with your blood!"
CONVERSATION_6019,"Argh... huff... huff..."
CONVERSATION_6020,"Ha... Hahaha... Ahahahaha!!"
CONVERSATION_6020_1,"What's so funny? Are you mocking me?!"
CONVERSATION_6020_2,"You... are so naive. You still have no idea why he died?"
CONVERSATION_6020_3,"What...?"
CONVERSATION_6020_4,"It is true that we killed him…"
CONVERSATION_6020_5,"But the request to kill you... We're not the only ones who received it."
CONVERSATION_6020_6,"There are many out there... who want that massive bounty placed on your head."
CONVERSATION_6020_7,"Meaning, Brian would've been killed by others... even if we hadn't killed him."
CONVERSATION_6020_8,"All because of you...!"
CONVERSATION_6020_9,"W-what...?"
CONVERSATION_6020_10,"I have no clue why our client wants you dead..."
CONVERSATION_6020_11,"But I do know this for sure... Your existence draws death... "
CONVERSATION_6020_12,"Remember this, kid... One day..."
CONVERSATION_6020_13,"Your friends... will all meet their tragic end because of you...!"
CONVERSATION_6020_14,"B-because of me...? No... That can't be...!"
CONVERSATION_6020_15,"Ugh... Ahahahahaha! You can't change fate no matter how you look at it!"
CONVERSATION_6020_16,"Because of you, all your friends will—"
CONVERSATION_6020_17,"Cut the crap!"
CONVERSATION_6021,"Are you hurt anywhere, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_6022,"Roi...?"
CONVERSATION_6023,"Whew... Looks like you're fine."
CONVERSATION_6024,"Who are these humans? Do you know them?"
CONVERSATION_6025,"As you can see, they're the assassins who are after Kasel's life."
CONVERSATION_6026,"Outsiders like these are in our territory? And how did they get ahead of us?! "
CONVERSATION_6027,"No other entities know this place better than us."
CONVERSATION_6028,"I'm so glad that Kasel is back to normal again."
CONVERSATION_6029,"Let's go and have a talk with him, Frey."
CONVERSATION_6030,"..."
CONVERSATION_6031,"(What was that just now? Was that one of the powers the warrior wields? But...)"
CONVERSATION_6032,"(No... That can't be. I've never felt such deep, dark power.)"
CONVERSATION_6033,"(It felt similar to the Core of Darkness... But in its root, it was something totally different, something extremely odd...)"
CONVERSATION_6034,"(The Holy Sword Aea is the sword given by Goddess Lua herself. I don't understand why it emits such evil energy...)"
CONVERSATION_6035,"(Does Lorraine know about this? If that's the case...)"
CONVERSATION_6036,"(I should talk about this with Lorraine later... For now, I must check if the warrior's ok or not.)"
CONVERSATION_6037,"The Laughing Masks... What happened to them?"
CONVERSATION_6038,"I think they're out of concerns now."
CONVERSATION_6039,"..."
CONVERSATION_6040,"A-are you alright?"
CONVERSATION_6041,"That moment when those Laughing Masks mocked Brian... Although it was for a split second, I'm sure I felt it."
CONVERSATION_6042,"The sword responded to my anger and emitted a dark energy."
CONVERSATION_6043,"And when that energy exploded, it felt dangerous... and somehow exhilarating to some degree."
CONVERSATION_6044,"Kasel..."
CONVERSATION_6045,"Honestly speaking, these happened a few times before. During that time near the World Tree, and the incident just now..."
CONVERSATION_6046,"It feels like I lose myself as the sword's power grows stronger."
CONVERSATION_6047,"What...?"
CONVERSATION_6048,"To be more exact, the Holy Sword resonates to my emotion, resulting in the amplification of the sword's power."
CONVERSATION_6049,"During that time, I felt as if I was being consumed by the Holy Sword's power."
CONVERSATION_6050,"Regardless, you quickly recovered! Doesn't that mean it's fine?"
CONVERSATION_6051,"Not to mention that you were totally yourself while you were talking with one of the Laughing Masks."
CONVERSATION_6052,"If what you just said were true, you would've lost yourself completely to the sword and became a mindless puppet by now, but nope."
CONVERSATION_6053,"When I was talking to one of the Laughing Masks, I was keeping my sanity."
CONVERSATION_6054,"But like that time back at the World Tree, I was drawn by an unknown power."
CONVERSATION_6055,"I remember my sword clashing against my enemy's, but I wasn't aware of my companions' presence at all."
CONVERSATION_6056,"I really don't know anymore.. Does someone like me deserve to be the master of Holy Sword?"
CONVERSATION_6057,"I'm not even using the sword's power properly.. I'm just being used by it."
CONVERSATION_6058,"If this keeps happening, I may put you all in danger."
CONVERSATION_6059,"Just like the Laughing Masks said, I might put all of you in—"
CONVERSATION_6060,"Enough! I don't want to hear anymore."
CONVERSATION_6061,"But!"
CONVERSATION_6062,"Stop. The more you say, the more you'll make the people who care about you miserable."
CONVERSATION_6063,"Frey..."
CONVERSATION_6064,"..."
CONVERSATION_6065,"Looks like he is completely out of it."
CONVERSATION_6066,"As you can see, the warrior is highly shaken."
CONVERSATION_6067,"To be honest, I don't think he'll be able to confront Balalaika in such a state."
CONVERSATION_6068,"It is unfortunate, but we have no time to waste."
CONVERSATION_6069,"Let me go and talk to Roi first."
CONVERSATION_6070,"Among the group, he is quite wise and knowledgeable. I'm sure he will understand our situation."
CONVERSATION_6071,"Ooh, scary."
CONVERSATION_6072,"I will go with you. We can solve our own problems."
CONVERSATION_6073,"Yeah! Go ahead and do whatever! Shoo, shoo!!"
CONVERSATION_6074,"Where's Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_6075,"He's with Frey. I guess he still needs more time to settle down."
CONVERSATION_6076,"..."
CONVERSATION_6077,"Oh, and I saw you having a conversation with the princess. Is something wrong?"
CONVERSATION_6078,"She said she'll go to the Lake of Eternity with Naila first."
CONVERSATION_6079,"And also added that it won't take long to get there if we take the main path, so we can take our time."
CONVERSATION_6080,"Hmm, will two be enough?"
CONVERSATION_6081,"The harpy queen Balala, or whatever, has the Core of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_6082,"The Core is strong enough to corrupt this vast forest. Will it be possible for those two to fight someone with such a powerful object?"
CONVERSATION_6083,"No idea.. But I guess they gave us some time to settle our personal matters."
CONVERSATION_6084,"As you know, the princess and Naila's common goal is to save their corrupted kin."
CONVERSATION_6085,"And they met the warrior of the Holy Sword who came in to help, but he's now helpless."
CONVERSATION_6086,"I'm sure they feel bad for Kasel, but the fact is that he's dragging them down."
CONVERSATION_6087,"But isn't it too much for those two to handle? I don't think they stand a chance..."
CONVERSATION_6088,"Of course it's too much. They have no chance at all."
CONVERSATION_6089,"We have no other choice but to get Kasel moving."
CONVERSATION_6090,"*Sigh*"
CONVERSATION_6091,"Um, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_6092,"..."
CONVERSATION_6093,"Kasel… should we go back to Orvel?"
CONVERSATION_6094,"I've been thinking.. even though you've been chosen as the successor of the Holy Sword,"
CONVERSATION_6095,"you don't have to take up the burden alone."
CONVERSATION_6096,"We have Clause in Orvel, and grandpa in the orphanage."
CONVERSATION_6097,"I'm sure they know a lot of powerful people who may help us with our adventure."
CONVERSATION_6098,"So why don't we go back for now, and ask around for help? Please?"
CONVERSATION_6099,"That is..."
CONVERSATION_6100,"Looks like you've still not made up your mind."
CONVERSATION_6101,"I'm sorry..."
CONVERSATION_6101_1,"You don't have to apologize. I'm here to tell you some bad news."
CONVERSATION_6101_2,"Princess Selene and Naila have headed to the Lake of Eternity without us."
CONVERSATION_6101_3,"It's thoughtful of them to give us some space, but I don't think they have a chance against the harpy queen."
CONVERSATION_6101_4,"They'll definitely be crushed by Balalaika."
CONVERSATION_6101_5,"Roi, can I have a word with you...?"
CONVERSATION_6101_6,"I think I must talk to Kasel first. I need to tell him a few things."
CONVERSATION_6101_7,"..."
CONVERSATION_6101_8,"Kasel, you can't quite remember what happened when you fought with the Laughing Masks, correct?"
CONVERSATION_6101_9,"Then let me tell you everything about it. Just like you said, you were engulfed by the sword's dark energy."
CONVERSATION_6101_10,"When its power exploded, it damaged both the Laughing Masks and us."
CONVERSATION_6101_11,"Thankfully, we took minor damage as we were quite far from you,"
CONVERSATION_6101_12,"but the Laughing Masks that were near you took massive damage."
CONVERSATION_6101_13,"R-Roi!"
CONVERSATION_6101_14,"To be honest, that was a bit frightening, but thanks to your power, we managed to defeat them easily."
CONVERSATION_6101_15,"Regardless of what happened, the result is what matters, correct?"
CONVERSATION_6101_16,"Roi!"
CONVERSATION_6101_17,"I-I injured you all...? The exploding power hurt everyone...?"
CONVERSATION_6101_18,"No, Kasel! That's not really true! That's not—"
CONVERSATION_6101_19,"Stop whining!"
CONVERSATION_6101_20,"It may not have been something you wanted to see happen, but the consequences are on you."
CONVERSATION_6101_21,"No matter how hard you try to deny what happened, nothing changes!"
CONVERSATION_6101_22,"If you want to protect your friends, then get strong enough to control that power!"
CONVERSATION_6101_23,"Nothing will get better if you just sit here and babble with that stupid look on your face."
CONVERSATION_6101_24,"Remember, the one who's entitled to defend others is the one who's willing to sacrifice himself."
CONVERSATION_6101_25,"Think of the kind of decision your teacher made to protect you!"
CONVERSATION_6101_26,"Oh, and let me make this perfectly clear."
CONVERSATION_6101_27,"Things Laughing Masks said are all garbage. It was a rationalization of their homicides."
CONVERSATION_6101_28,"Most teachers accept apprentices who they wish to pass their will onto."
CONVERSATION_6101_29,"That's why they care and give their everything to their apprentices."
CONVERSATION_6101_30,"Which means that as an apprentice, you should trust your teacher more than anyone!"
CONVERSATION_6101_31,"Don't let your teacher's sacrifice be in vain! Don't let that meaningless guilt degrade his hard work! "
CONVERSATION_6101_32,"T-that's not how it is!"
CONVERSATION_6101_33,"I-I'm just..."
CONVERSATION_6101_34,"Your teacher sacrificed his own life and passed everything onto you..."
CONVERSATION_6101_35,"I believe it's time for you to act as he did."
CONVERSATION_6101_36,"..."
CONVERSATION_6101_37,"You said.. Princess Selene and Naila could be in danger, right?"
CONVERSATION_6101_38,"Yeah. They're probably fighting against the harpy queen at the moment."
CONVERSATION_6101_39,"Ok then... I'll think about what to do with the Holy Sword later."
CONVERSATION_6101_40,"Right now.. I just want to help those two."
CONVERSATION_6101_41,"Kasel..."
CONVERSATION_6101_42,"Finally! You made up your mind now?"
CONVERSATION_6101_43,"Everyone has a moment where they agonize with a problem and reflect on it."
CONVERSATION_6101_44,"As if you ever had a moment like that before."
CONVERSATION_6101_45,"Say that again?!"
CONVERSATION_6101_46,"Let's get moving then. We should find them before it's too late!"
CONVERSATION_6101_47,"Huh? W-wait for me!"
CONVERSATION_6101_48,"Man, he's a real tough one to get moving."
CONVERSATION_6101_49,"Um, Roi."
CONVERSATION_6101_50,"Thank you so much."
CONVERSATION_6102,"Princess Selene! Naila!"
CONVERSATION_6103,"Grr, my warrior...? Is that really you?"
CONVERSATION_6104,"Fufufu, I did not expect the Holy Sword to be here."
CONVERSATION_6105,"Soon, Elidora Forest and 'his' gift shall be bestowed on me."
CONVERSATION_6106,"Err, her mana is disgusting! It's stronger than that witch's!"
CONVERSATION_6107,"Roi, I'm going to use my fire magic to distract her. Meanwhile, you go and—"
CONVERSATION_6108,"'His'? Himmullis also said something about 'him' before. Is he the same person she's talking about? And who is 'he'?"
CONVERSATION_6109,"Roi! Are you listening to me?"
CONVERSATION_6110,"Hmm? Oh yeah, I was listening. Actually, um..."
CONVERSATION_6111,"No, I wasn't listening. Sorry."
CONVERSATION_6112,"You….!"
CONVERSATION_6113,"Watch out, everyone! Her dark power seems stronger than anything we've come across!"
CONVERSATION_6114,"Be cautious, or we may all get corrupted in a split second."
CONVERSATION_6115,"I, Balalaika, the queen of the harpies, order you."
CONVERSATION_6116,"Hand over that sword."
CONVERSATION_6117,"If you do, you all shall also receive 'his' gift, and he will bring you all the eternal pleasure."
CONVERSATION_6118,"Balalaika, you betrayed your own people. Not only that, but you also corrupted their very soul..."
CONVERSATION_6119,"How could you, the bane of our tribe, address yourself as the queen...?!"
CONVERSATION_6120,"Tsk... Pitiful creature. Still alive, I see."
CONVERSATION_6121,"You should have never talked. If you did, then maybe you could've run away with your life."
CONVERSATION_6122,"Ahhh!!"
CONVERSATION_6123,"Ha, a pawn should never disobey her queen."
CONVERSATION_6124,"You just wait. I will rip you apart after I take away that Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6124_1,"What kind of queen is that?! She's trying to kill her own warrior after beating her to a pulp?!"
CONVERSATION_6124_2,"Balalaika! Why are you doing this!"
CONVERSATION_6124_3,"Aren't the harpies of your tribe your family?! Why did you corrupt them?"
CONVERSATION_6124_4,"What..? A family? Ahahahaha!"
CONVERSATION_6124_5,"The harpies were, and still are, a group of my faithful servants. "
CONVERSATION_6124_6,"All they have to do is to serve and obey me!"
CONVERSATION_6124_7,"What I did was make them realize what purpose these foolish slaves exist for."
CONVERSATION_6124_8,"They must always follow my order without questioning, and never have second thoughts."
CONVERSATION_6124_9,"That is the honor and duty the harpies should and must have!"
CONVERSATION_6124_10,"She's insane. I'd say she got badly brainwashed."
CONVERSATION_6124_11,"Her logic makes me throw up... It certainly doesn't sound like something anyone sane would say."
CONVERSATION_6124_12,"Now, hand over that Holy Sword!"
CONVERSATION_6124_13,"You really want this sword that bad?"
CONVERSATION_6124_14,"I may not be the true warrior of the Holy Sword, but I'm not going to hand over this sword to you!"
CONVERSATION_6124_15,"Ha... Hahahahaha! You dare to defy me? The queen of the harpies?"
CONVERSATION_6124_16,"Fine. I will get rid of all of you!"
CONVERSATION_6125,"What should we do? None of our attacks are really working!"
CONVERSATION_6126,"I wish my magic could roast her like a roasted chicken!"
CONVERSATION_6127,"This is bad... We won't be able to hold much longer at this rate."
CONVERSATION_6128,"Is everyone okay?!"
CONVERSATION_6129,"Lorraine!"
CONVERSATION_6130,"You... You must be the Great Sage Lorraine!"
CONVERSATION_6131,"(Now's our chance! I must go and save the princess and Naila while Balalaika is distracted!)"
CONVERSATION_6132,"Argh, am I still alive...?"
CONVERSATION_6133,"Thank you for your help, dear priest... I'm in your debt."
CONVERSATION_6134,"Save your thanks for later. Let's focus on taking that chicken down for now."
CONVERSATION_6135,"Huhuhuhu... Ahahahaha!"
CONVERSATION_6136,"Do you really think you stand a chance against me with a single reinforcement?"
CONVERSATION_6137,"Foolish beings. Bow before 'his' might!"
CONVERSATION_6138,"I can't believe it. Such immense dark power can only be harnessed by elder demons, but how!?"
CONVERSATION_6139,"Huhuhuhu, yes...! This unutterable pleasure!"
CONVERSATION_6140,"I... can feel it! The almighty power 'he' has bestowed upon me!"
CONVERSATION_6141,"Yes, this power, I feel it!"
CONVERSATION_6142,"This is it. I will blow you all away!"
CONVERSATION_6143,"Aside from the Sword, I have no need for you trash!!"
CONVERSATION_6144,"This memory is..."
CONVERSATION_6145,"That's right... This is the time when my village was raided by the Demons."
CONVERSATION_6146,"Mom... Dad..."
CONVERSATION_6147,"If only I wasn't a child at that time... If only I was strong enough..."
CONVERSATION_6148,"Then I would've protected you all...!"
CONVERSATION_6149,"Ahhhhh!"
CONVERSATION_6150,"A light... from the Holy Sword?"
CONVERSATION_6151,"What a power... So that must be the true power of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6152,"The Core of Darkness is shattering!"
CONVERSATION_6153,"Get ready, everyone! We must attack with everything we've got, the moment the Core is fully destroyed!"
CONVERSATION_6154,"How.. How dare you!!!"
CONVERSATION_6155,"How dare you try to destroy the gift 'he' bestowed upon me..?!"
CONVERSATION_6156,"Now! We must finish her now!"
CONVERSATION_6157,"Haaaaaa!!"
CONVERSATION_6158,"I know all of you are exhausted,, but please hang in there!"
CONVERSATION_6159,"That day..."
CONVERSATION_6160,"The day when I last saw my mother."
CONVERSATION_6161,"Finally, I now remember."
CONVERSATION_6162,"Listen... Kasel."
CONVERSATION_6163,"Before we got separated, mom said something..."
CONVERSATION_6164,"You... are King Kyle's..."
CONVERSATION_6165,"Where... am I?"
CONVERSATION_6166,"Your mind. The inner world of your mind, precisely."
CONVERSATION_6167,"You are being controlled by the Holy Sword's power, are you not?"
CONVERSATION_6168,"How did you...?"
CONVERSATION_6169,"The sword resonates and draws its power as the owner's emotion fluctuates."
CONVERSATION_6170,"You must understand though, that the power of brilliant light is not the only thing that exists inside the Holy Sword. "
CONVERSATION_6171,"Although King Kyle managed to defeat Dark Lord Angmund 100 years ago,"
CONVERSATION_6172,"a portion of Angmund's power made its way inside the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6173,"Then the dark energy I felt must be..."
CONVERSATION_6174,"Whether that dark energy gets released, or stays dormant, lies solely on you."
CONVERSATION_6175,"From the looks of it, you seem to not like the fact that you have been chosen as the successor of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6176,"Unfortunately, the Holy Sword Aea is a weapon only the Orvelia's royalty can wield."
CONVERSATION_6177,"Fate has already been decided, and it can't be undone."
CONVERSATION_6178,"To be honest... I'm afraid of everything."
CONVERSATION_6179,"What if my body and mind get dominated by the sword like last time? What if I hurt my friends again?"
CONVERSATION_6180,"Of course you must be afraid. That's totally normal for a human."
CONVERSATION_6181,"But I have faith that you will become stronger by reflecting upon your weakness and overcoming it."
CONVERSATION_6182,"Do not succumb, my warrior. You should not let the Holy Sword, and other dark beings, defeat you."
CONVERSATION_6183,"..."
CONVERSATION_6184,"Seek for the divided power of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6184_1,"As the light of the Holy Sword gets stronger, dark energy within the sword will never be able to show itself again."
CONVERSATION_6184_2,"You, then, will never be dominated by your sword."
CONVERSATION_6184_3,"But I'm not sure if I'll be able to make that happen."
CONVERSATION_6184_4,"However, the fact that my destiny will be unchanged is also true."
CONVERSATION_6184_5,"It won't be easy for the time being, but I'll try to slowly accept my destiny."
CONVERSATION_6184_6,"About the Holy Sword, my background, myself, everything..."
CONVERSATION_6184_7,"Good. Very good."
CONVERSATION_6184_8,"It will be a difficult journey. The upcoming darkness is unavoidable. There will be many hardships and obstacles that block your path."
CONVERSATION_6184_9,"But know this: You are not alone."
CONVERSATION_6184_10,"Never forget about your friends who stay by your side and care about you. Appreciate every moment with them."
CONVERSATION_6184_11,"I will... Thank you, the Great Sage."
CONVERSATION_6185,"Kasel! Kasel! Wake up!"
CONVERSATION_6186,"Where am I..?"
CONVERSATION_6187,"Are you alright?"
CONVERSATION_6188,"Where's Balalaika? Where's everyone? Are they alright?!"
CONVERSATION_6189,"Calm down. Everything went right, so you don't have to worry about anything now."
CONVERSATION_6190,"Huh? What do you mean..?"
CONVERSATION_6191,"Meaning Balalaika is defeated, we're all safe."
CONVERSATION_6192,"That stupid harpy screeched real hard when she got struck by your final blow."
CONVERSATION_6193,"It was quite satisfying to see her cocky face get ugly."
CONVERSATION_6194,"I see…"
CONVERSATION_6195,"My warrior, are you really alright?"
CONVERSATION_6196,"It's good to see that you are unharmed, but we were worried because you lost your consciousness all of a sudden."
CONVERSATION_6197,"Ahaha, I'm alright. I apologize for making you all worry."
CONVERSATION_6198,"If it weren't for you and your friends, Balalaika would've killed both me and the princess."
CONVERSATION_6199,"I wish to show my gratitude, especially to you, the warrior of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6200,"Your aid was crucial to stop this once and for all. There will be no further casualties."
CONVERSATION_6201,"I'm glad to hear that my unimpressive strength was helpful."
CONVERSATION_6202,"Speaking of which, now that your former queen Balalaika is gone, what's next for the harpies...?"
CONVERSATION_6203,"I'm going to focus on rescuing those who became corrupted."
CONVERSATION_6204,"I'll have my next plan after then."
CONVERSATION_6205,"I see..."
CONVERSATION_6206,"By the way, what happened back there? I have no idea what has happened with the Core of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_6207,"I know that Balalaika happily unleashed that power,"
CONVERSATION_6208,"but I have no idea why and how the sword reacted it, and let out the powerful light."
CONVERSATION_6209,"Judging by Kasel's look, it's not a power he intended to use."
CONVERSATION_6210,"Hoho. That's because I restored the power of the Holy Sword I have been keeping."
CONVERSATION_6211,"Uh, pardon?"
CONVERSATION_6212,"That was really close."
CONVERSATION_6213,"I didn't expect that Balalaika could easily use the power of the Core of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_6214,"The moment the dark power tried to consume us, I awakened the divided power of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6215,"Thanks to that power, the warrior of the Holy Sword was able to strike her down."
CONVERSATION_6216,"However, I wasn't sure if that would work. It was a risky gamble."
CONVERSATION_6217,"Woah, so you're saying that we might've all been in trouble if your plan failed?"
CONVERSATION_6218,"In the worst case scenario, we would have been corrupted by the dark power."
CONVERSATION_6219,"It was one giant gamble, but it turned out well in the end. Isn't that what matters?"
CONVERSATION_6220,"It is, but..."
CONVERSATION_6221,"And now, where will you all head to?"
CONVERSATION_6222,"We have no plans yet. We were told that we'll be able to get our destination in here."
CONVERSATION_6223,"Hmm, then I suggest the Ogria Mountain."
CONVERSATION_6224,"Ogria... Isn't it an orc territory?"
CONVERSATION_6224_1,"We haven't really interacted with each other for a while.. but the brave orcs are the tribe who fought alongside King Kyle in the war against the Demons."
CONVERSATION_6224_2,"After the fall of Angmund, Aeatola, the high chieftain of the orcs at the time, joined me in dividing the Holy Sword's power."
CONVERSATION_6224_3,"From what I've heard, the orcs appoint the succeeding chieftain as the keeper of that power."
CONVERSATION_6224_4,"Hmmm... What do you all think?"
CONVERSATION_6224_5,"We don't know much information about the Holy Sword anyways. It won't hurt to visit there."
CONVERSATION_6224_6,"I think the same. Why are we even talking about this? We should go where the power of the Holy Sword is."
CONVERSATION_6224_7,"I'm sure that witch will make her appearance if the Holy Sword's power is indeed there."
CONVERSATION_6224_8,"I also think we should go there."
CONVERSATION_6224_9,"Even for the slim chance, we must go for it."
CONVERSATION_6224_10,"And for the sake of Kasel, we must quickly restore the full power of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_6224_11,"Looks like we've reached a consensus."
CONVERSATION_6224_12,"Ok then, Ogria is our next destination."
CONVERSATION_6224_13,"That was fast."
CONVERSATION_6224_14,"I suggest you take a rest for today at our place. You all have gone through so much lately."
CONVERSATION_6224_15,"(She's right... Everyone's trying to look fine, but I'm sure they're very exhausted.)"
CONVERSATION_6224_16,"We'll take your offer. Thank you for your kindness, Princess Selene."
CONVERSATION_6224_17,"Then we should get a special banquet ready for our guests. I will personally lead the preparation for tonight."
CONVERSATION_6224_18,"May the blessing of Elidora light upon you all."
CS_CH3_Main_1_001,"Finally, an orc."
CS_CH3_Main_1_002,"I'm Kasel, from the human nation of Orvelia."
CS_CH3_Main_1_003,"I wish to seek an audience with the ruler of Ogria, the High Chieftain of the Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_1_004,"Cruel, evil humans, wanting to meet the High Chieftain?!"
CS_CH3_Main_1_005,"Um, this welcoming committee is a bit..."
CS_CH3_Main_1_006,"They seem quite hostile..."
CS_CH3_Main_1_007,"In the name of the High Chieftain, punish these vile humans!!"
CS_CH3_Main_1_008,"Careful, they're coming!"
CS_CH3_Main_2_001,"Since the invasion of the Demons, I'm sure the orcs and humans haven't been hostile..."
CS_CH3_Main_2_002,"They even called us cruel and evil. Did we do something wrong?"
CS_CH3_Main_2_003,"Well, Orvelians are not the only humans in the world."
CS_CH3_Main_2_004,"There are organizations like the Laughing Mask here and there, as well."
CS_CH3_Main_2_005,"If I remember correctly, there's a human empire far away from here as well."
CS_CH3_Main_2_006,"What kind of human has made the orcs so angry?"
CS_CH3_Main_2_007,"I do hope we could solve this misunderstanding soon."
CS_CH3_Main_3_001,"Wait, thats..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_002,"Not again..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_003,"That's a golem!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_004,"Sigh...here comes the trauma..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_005,"Does Cleo love golems like she loves slimes?"
CS_CH3_Main_3_006,"I assume Roi had to clean up after Cleo when she tried to make a golem..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_007,"Clean what?!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_008,"Oh, don't even get me started on that fiasco..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_009,"Remember? You gathered some pebbles saying you were going to build a pet golem."
CS_CH3_Main_3_010,"Then you cast the wrong magic, causing burning pebbles to go fly all over the place."
CS_CH3_Main_3_011,"I'm telling you again Roi, sweating the small stuff will never get you a date!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_012,"So did she fail to make a golem in the end?"
CS_CH3_Main_3_013,"You too, Kasel! You won't ever be popular if you don't mince words!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_014,"Anyway, I will make that golem mine this time no matter what!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_015,"Now bring that cutie to me, Roi."
CS_CH3_Main_3_016,"I refuse."
CS_CH3_Main_3_017,"Our priority is beating that golem and finding a reasonable orc as soon as possible."
CS_CH3_Main_3_018,"Roi, you big idiot! Hmph!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_001,"Stupid Roi, why did you turn that golem into dust!!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_002,"Golems aren't easy to cut, indeed."
CS_CH3_Main_4_003,"Cleo, have you heard of golems roaming about in Ogria before?"
CS_CH3_Main_4_004,"Eh? Actually, come to think of it, I never heard about any orcs controlling golems before."
CS_CH3_Main_4_005,"Considering orcs and humans haven't really interacted with each other for the past 100 years..."
CS_CH3_Main_4_006,"Maybe they learned how to handle golems in the meantime?"
CS_CH3_Main_4_007,"Hmph, there's no way a dumb orc can make a golem. Even an archmage like me wasn't able to make one!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_008,"Well, this archmage of ours couldn't make a single slime..."
CS_CH3_Main_4_009,"Roi!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_010,"Hahahaha..."
CS_CH3_Main_4_011,"Stop laughing!!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_001,"Huh? Goblins in Ogria?"
CS_CH3_Main_5_002,"Golems, and now Goblins too..."
CS_CH3_Main_5_003,"It seems our information about Ogria was faulty."
CS_CH3_Main_5_004,"Ach! Humans! Run!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_005,"Ach, run from humans, orcs kill us!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_006,"Orcs strong! Humans weak!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_007,"Kek! What do??"
CS_CH3_Main_5_008,"What do?! Fight Humans, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_009,"Whaaaat!? You idiots...I'll teach you how powerful a human archmage can be!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_010,"That's not the point..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_001,"Cleo, that was a bit overboard."
CS_CH3_Main_6_002,"From the looks of it, they attacked us only because the orcs threatened them..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_003,"Humph, stop covering for the goblins."
CS_CH3_Main_6_004,"Just side with me for once..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_005,"Sigh...I can't deal with this."
CS_CH3_Main_6_006,"They attacked us first, Frey, it's not like we could help it."
CS_CH3_Main_6_007,"I wasn't exactly trying to cover for the goblins..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_008,"I'm sorry for sounding that way, Cleo."
CS_CH3_Main_6_009,"Don't do it again, alright?...."
CS_CH3_Main_6_010,"Yes. I'll side with you from now on."
CS_CH3_Main_6_011,"Still, I think we should find out why the goblins had to attack us."
CS_CH3_Main_6_012,"Agreed."
CS_CH3_Main_6_013,"I'm confused why the goblins are in Ogria in the first place..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_014,"not to mention why the orcs are making them attack us. "
CS_CH3_Main_6_015,"Shall we ask the next goblins we meet?"
CS_CH3_Main_6_016,"Yeah...I guess we need to capture a few again."
CS_CH3_Main_7_001,"Hello, goblin friends!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_002,"Ach! Human!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_003,"Don't be afraid, we don't want to fight you."
CS_CH3_Main_7_004,"Ach, Lua Order...Save us!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_005,"Tricks! Orc say, don't believe Human, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_006,"Crool...ebil? Anyway bad!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_007,"Only 'He' save Goblins, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_008,"Hmm...come to think of it, we still don't know who this 'He' person is that Himmulus and Balalaika mentioned."
CS_CH3_Main_7_009,"I wonder it's the same person..."
CS_CH3_Main_7_010,"Well, I guess we need to beat up these dummies first."
CS_CH3_Main_7_011,"Right, Frey?"
CS_CH3_Main_7_012,"*Sigh*..I guess so."
CS_CH3_Main_8_001,"Ach! Help!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_002,"Calm down, we are not trying to hurt you."
CS_CH3_Main_8_003,"You attacked us first, and we only fought back."
CS_CH3_Main_8_004,"Ach! Orcs trick us!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_005,"Lua Order Human nice!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_006,"Thank you."
CS_CH3_Main_8_007,"If possible, could you tell me why you had to attack us?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_008,"We Goblins exiled from Kings Plains, ach."
CS_CH3_Main_8_009,"Do Orcs chores, get food."
CS_CH3_Main_8_010,"Now Orcs say kill Humans, or they kill Goblins!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_011,"Why did the orcs tell you to kill humans?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_012,"Ach! Dunno!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_013,"Why were you exiled from the Kings Plains?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_014,"Erk...Bodakka...Bodakka exile us!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_015,"Ach! He say, no need weak Goblin!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_016,"Weak goblins? With this kind of weaponry, Bodakka looks insignificant in comparison."
CS_CH3_Main_8_017,"Weapons, 'He' give us!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_018,"He' free Goblins from Orc!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_019,"Who is this 'He'?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_020,"Sorry, ach... Can't say. We secret...eh..."
CS_CH3_Main_8_021,"Residence?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_022,"Resistance?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_023,"Yes, Resistance! Anyway, secret, ach. Can't say."
CS_CH3_Main_8_024,"Well, that's it I guess. We'll try to figure out the rest some other way."
CS_CH3_Main_8_025,"Thank you for telling us what you know."
CS_CH3_Main_8_026,"Ach...Other Goblins, still attack you."
CS_CH3_Main_8_027,"Sorry advance! Go easy them, ach..."
CS_CH3_Main_9_001,"Front go!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_002,"Yay, Golem works!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_003,"Come!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_004,"Control Golem! 'He' genius!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_005,"......."
CS_CH3_Main_9_006,"Cleo. Cleo?"
CS_CH3_Main_9_007,"Well well, it seems she's shocked to see goblins controlling golems."
CS_CH3_Main_9_008,"They succeeded where she failed, after all."
CS_CH3_Main_9_009,"Roiiiiiiii!!!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_010,"Ach! Human!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_011,"Ach! Spy us! Orcs make Humans spy on us!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_012,"We aren't spies..."
CS_CH3_Main_9_013,"Not like they'll understand before we beat them up."
CS_CH3_Main_9_014,"Bring it on, you dumb goblins!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_015,"I'll make you pay for humiliating me!!"
CS_CH3_Main_10_001,"Fufufu, piece of cake!!"
CS_CH3_Main_10_002,"Cleo, you're breathing rather loudly."
CS_CH3_Main_10_003,"Hmph, I'm not tired at all!"
CS_CH3_Main_10_004,"She's clearly mad. After all, those 'dumb goblins' did beat her at controlling a golem..."
CS_CH3_Main_10_005,"That's not true,stupid Roi!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_001,"Kyak!! Stop! Human me friend!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_002,"Lakrak?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_003,"Wait, you are..?!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_004,"..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_005,"Crow witch! I've been waiting for you!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_006,"I want to ask you about your old friend you mentioned before..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_007,"Fufu, you are a stubborn lady. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_008,"If you help me, I will tell you what you wish to hear."
CS_CH3_Main_11_009,"What!? Are you telling me to help demons!?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_010,"Fufu, don't panic. I'm not asking for much."
CS_CH3_Main_11_011,"Lakrak. You seem to be on the same side with her. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_012,"Why are you allied with Demons?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_013,"Ack? This woman demon? "
CS_CH3_Main_11_014,"So...are you really going to give up now? White Goblin. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_015,"...."
CS_CH3_Main_11_016,"Demon or not, no care!! Ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_017,"She help make strong weapon!!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_018,"Ah...Lua, my Goddess.."
CS_CH3_Main_11_019,"Please save that poor goblin's soul from the clutches of darkness..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_020,"You silly priest. Lua won't save anyone."
CS_CH3_Main_11_021,"Pray on all you want, but she will never respond."
CS_CH3_Main_11_022,"That damned goddess..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_023,"What? How dare..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_024,"No, the holy sword is proof enough."
CS_CH3_Main_11_025,"It is a present from the goddess, bearing her wish to stop the demons from destroying this world, like you did long ago!!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_026,"Fufufu..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_027,"Hahahahahaha!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_028,"A present? That thing?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_029,"Believe what you want to believe. Deeply...yes, wholeheartedly."
CS_CH3_Main_11_030,"Only then will you despair, cursing Lua and the holy sword."
CS_CH3_Main_11_031,"I really want to witness your cute face twist in horror and despair, streaked with tears..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_032,"What!? What are you talking about? "
CS_CH3_Main_11_033,"Fufufu..."
CS_CH3_Main_11_034,"Let's meet again. Child of Arlette. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_035,"Wait! Witch!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_036,"Arlette... She called me a child of Arlette."
CS_CH3_Main_11_037,"Roi, that's it..! My mother's name is Arlette..!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_001,"Hah...Lakrak."
CS_CH3_Main_12_002,"After you appeared with that witch, Maria, everything is a mess."
CS_CH3_Main_12_003,"Did you really decide to team up with the Demons? "
CS_CH3_Main_12_004,"Team up Demons? Ach, no! "
CS_CH3_Main_12_005,"I no know woman Demon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_006,"I don't think she is a demon, really..."
CS_CH3_Main_12_007,"I know she's a human. But is she on the side of Demons?"
CS_CH3_Main_12_008,"That's none of our business. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_009,"What's important is that the witch is dangerous to us."
CS_CH3_Main_12_010,"And Lakrak, we need to know why you were with her. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_011,"Ach! Me journey, make powerful weapon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_012,"I meet her here!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_013,"She say, me help make powerful weapon, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_014,"Weapon impossible just tech! Magic Weapon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_015,"She help, golem controller make!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_016,"I knew it! "
CS_CH3_Main_12_017,"I knew a goblin couldn't create a golem controller on its own."
CS_CH3_Main_12_018,"You look relieved, Cleo."
CS_CH3_Main_12_019,"Of course! Though I was surprised a bit at first. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_020,"The woman said my mother's name aloud and disappeared."
CS_CH3_Main_12_021,"For what reason has she...?"
CS_CH3_Main_12_022,"Ach, powerful weapon free no!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_023,"Goblin save from orc, payment!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_024,"*Sigh*... then the 'He' that goblins were bragging about was.."
CS_CH3_Main_12_025,"Never expected it to be Lakrak. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_026,"So bother, ach! Lead dumb goblin crowd, bah!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_027,"But why is Maria helping the goblins? "
CS_CH3_Main_12_028,"Kyak! Dunno! No important!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_029,"I focus strong weapon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_030,"She said we'd meet again...You can ask her then."
CS_CH3_Main_12_031,"That's not the only question I should ask of her."
CS_CH3_Main_12_032,"She must know something about my mom too..."
CS_CH3_Main_12_033,"Also...what she mentioned about me cursing the Lua..."
CS_CH3_Main_12_034,"..."
CS_CH3_Main_13_001,"Is Lakrak coming with us? "
CS_CH3_Main_13_002,"Test Custom Hand-Cannon Lakrak MK-3, Orc subject! Yes!"
CS_CH3_Main_13_003,"Can't you test things by yourself?"
CS_CH3_Main_13_004,"Ugh.... That's..."
CS_CH3_Main_13_005,"Allied situation test!"
CS_CH3_Main_13_006,"Ach, testing efficiency when fight together!!"
CS_CH3_Main_13_007,"Yeah, yeah, whatever you say."
CS_CH3_Main_14_001,"That is a misunderstanding, Throne. Listen to me..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_002,"I have listened to you words after words. "
CS_CH3_Main_14_003,"They are but nonsense and drivel."
CS_CH3_Main_14_004,"That's not true."
CS_CH3_Main_14_005,"The orcs seem to have some issues of their own..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_006,"Oh... You must be..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_007,"the successor of the holy sword!"
CS_CH3_Main_14_008,"Wait, how did you..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_009,"Look, Throne. Here is the successor of the holy sword that I mentioned earlier."
CS_CH3_Main_14_010,"A holy sword? Psh... what's the use of it now anyway?"
CS_CH3_Main_14_011,"Throne. The emergence of holy sword means that the world is in danger."
CS_CH3_Main_14_012,"The orcs are already in a crisis. "
CS_CH3_Main_14_013,"Because of those humans! "
CS_CH3_Main_14_014,"We have no idea what you are talking about..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_015,"Move, Kaulah! I will cut you down if you don't."
CS_CH3_Main_14_016,"..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_017,"Ah... forgive me, Throne. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_001,"Kaulah!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_002,"You...you traitor..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_003,"How can you stand on their side... those treacherous..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_004,"I'm terribly sorry, Throne. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_005,"You... our brothers will not let this go."
CS_CH3_Main_15_006,"They will chase after you.... to the end of the world... Kaulah...."
CS_CH3_Main_15_007,"You will pay for...your betrayal..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_008,"..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_009,"Throne.. Throne!!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_010,"I'm sorry. I could not choose otherwise, forgive me..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_011,"May the blessing of Lua be with you."
CS_CH3_Main_15_012,"I'm sorry you had to go through all this because of me...and upon all that be branded as a traitor..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_013,"How did you know that Kasel was the successor of the holy sword?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_014,"Is his name Kasel?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_015,"I had a prophetic dream of him holding the holy sword."
CS_CH3_Main_15_016,"A prophetic dream?!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_017,"I've heard of those before."
CS_CH3_Main_15_018,"Some of the superior shaman orcs can see the future ahead through their prophetic dreams. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_019,"You've said the orcs were in danger because of the humans. What in the world is happening? "
CS_CH3_Main_15_020,"Recently, some of my brethren have been going missing..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_021,"And there was a rumor..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_022,"that humans were enslaving us."
CS_CH3_Main_15_023,"Unbelievable!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_024,"Humans, taking orcs as slaves!? That's a total nonsense! "
CS_CH3_Main_15_025,"We've never ever heard of it nor seen it!!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_026,"I know. I believe you."
CS_CH3_Main_15_027,"The other orcs, however, believe this is true."
CS_CH3_Main_15_028,"The High Chieftain Sieg is especially angry, and has a hatred of humans."
CS_CH3_Main_15_029,"Sieg? Is he the current High chieftain?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_030,"What about Garuk? "
CS_CH3_Main_15_031,"Garuk trusted the humans. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_032,"So Sieg challenged him to a duel, and killed him to become the next High Chieftain."
CS_CH3_Main_15_033,"Isn't that... treason?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_034,"Orcs sometimes choose their leader like that."
CS_CH3_Main_15_035,"That's quite barbarious."
CS_CH3_Main_15_036,"It was, in fact, a dead tradition."
CS_CH3_Main_15_037,"However, as rage against the humans rose,"
CS_CH3_Main_15_038,"Sieg had the support of many of my kind who believed we should strike back at the humans."
CS_CH3_Main_15_039,"He then used the duel as a means of showing he would revive old traditions."
CS_CH3_Main_15_040,"What is the possibility that humans are indeed enslaving orcs?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_041,"Like, perhaps that empire."
CS_CH3_Main_15_042,"The Vespian Empire?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_043,"No, it wouldn't make any sense."
CS_CH3_Main_15_044,"They have no reason to come this far for mere slaves. Their land is too far away."
CS_CH3_Main_15_045,"Hmm... I see."
CS_CH3_Main_15_046,"We should go meet the High Chieftain to sort out this misunderstanding."
CS_CH3_Main_15_047,"We should first meet my apprentice, Dain. He will be able to help us."
CS_CH3_Main_16_001,"Do you know about the divided power of the holy sword?"
CS_CH3_Main_16_002,"Yes. Our legendary High Chieftain, Aeatola,"
CS_CH3_Main_16_003,"the Orc hero that had helped Kyle at the time, put the power into a talisman. "
CS_CH3_Main_16_004,"The talisman has then passed on to each generation of High Chieftains. "
CS_CH3_Main_16_005,"Then Sieg must have it now."
CS_CH3_Main_16_006,"Correct."
CS_CH3_Main_16_007,"*Sigh*...what a pain."
CS_CH3_Main_17_001,"We will be able to meet Dain, north from here."
CS_CH3_Main_17_002,"I hope no harm befell him because of me..."
CS_CH3_Main_17_003,"Goddess Lua, please protect Dain, the apprentice of Kaulah. "
CS_CH3_Main_17_004,"We should hurry before anything bad happens."
CS_CH3_Main_18_001,"Master! Are you all right?"
CS_CH3_Main_18_002,"Oh, Dain. Thank the heavens. I was worried about you."
CS_CH3_Main_18_003,"And I am still worried about you to this day"
CS_CH3_Main_18_004,"Why are you with humans in these dangerous times?"
CS_CH3_Main_18_005,"I'm sorry...Kaulah was branded a traitor because of us."
CS_CH3_Main_18_006,"I have something private to discuss with my master, could you guests wait here for a while? "
CS_CH3_Main_18_007,"Of course. "
CS_CH3_Main_18_008,"What, what is it? "
CS_CH3_Main_18_009,"A trap?!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_010,"What is going on, Dain?!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_011,"I have to get rid of the humans, master. I'm sorry. "
CS_CH3_Main_18_012,"This is the only way to keep you alive."
CS_CH3_Main_18_013,"You blinded fool... The darkness is attempting to swallow this very world."
CS_CH3_Main_18_014,"The safety of the orcs is not the only thing at stake!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_015,"We're gonna fall!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_016,"Kasel: Frey!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_017,"Frey: Kyaaaaaa!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_018,"Kasel: No, Lua, Please..."
CS_CH3_Main_18_019,"Kasel: Protect Frey.. Please!!! If anyone has to die, please let it be me...and not Frey!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_020,"Cleo: Frey!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_021,"Roi: Guh..."
CS_CH3_Main_18_022,"Cleo: Won't...give up!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_023,"Roi: Give me your hand, Kasel!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_024,"Roi: I got you!! Up, now, Cleo!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_025,"Cleo: Okay, Let me show you what speed is!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_026,"Cleo: My staff is the staff to pierce the heavens!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_027,"Roi: Ugh... we saved them, you can slow down now..."
CS_CH3_Main_19_001,"What are you planning."
CS_CH3_Main_19_002,"This is the order of the High Chieftain Sieg. He said he would kill you if we didn't get rid of the humans."
CS_CH3_Main_19_003,"Absurd...Are you trying to doom the world with darkness because of me!?"
CS_CH3_Main_19_004,"That is why... we have come to save the world from the darkness!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_005,"Oh... You are alive."
CS_CH3_Main_19_006,"Grk...You shouldn't be alive!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_007,"Die!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_008,"Stop!! Dain, Stop!!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_009,"I'm sorry, Kaulah. We have to defend ourselves..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_001,"Kugh.... They are strong..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_002,"Let's stop now, Dain. These people can beat some sense into Sieg."
CS_CH3_Main_20_003,"That...sounds possible..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_004,"What did you do that for?!!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_005,"Humph, Orcs are so naive."
CS_CH3_Main_20_006,"Well, that is the cause of this entire mess, anyhow."
CS_CH3_Main_20_007,"Maria!! Why..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_008,"Not only the orcs, but you too are all so naïve."
CS_CH3_Main_20_009,"Did you really think you'd be able to persuade him? "
CS_CH3_Main_20_010,"We should at least try!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_011,"And then you will die trying."
CS_CH3_Main_20_012,"I can't have you dying, just yet."
CS_CH3_Main_20_013,"And why is that?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_014,"Hmm, don't you remember? "
CS_CH3_Main_20_015,"I said I want to see you in a certain situation."
CS_CH3_Main_20_016,"Was that about us cursing Lua?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_017,"Yeah, I wanted to ask you what you meant about that."
CS_CH3_Main_20_018,"Fufufu, you'll have to figure that out by yourself."
CS_CH3_Main_20_019,"There are so many more stories to tell you."
CS_CH3_Main_20_020,"Okay, then tell me about my mother Arlette.."
CS_CH3_Main_20_021,"Fufufu, Arlette.. I never said Arlette was your mother..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_022,"What?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_023,"Come to think of it, all four of us don't know our parents. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_024,"Do you know any other of our parents, aside from Cleo's?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_025,"Fufu, Don't rush. Take it easy."
CS_CH3_Main_20_026,"Today I came to tell you another story. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_027,"A story about who triggered the Orcish hatred for humans."
CS_CH3_Main_20_028,"I wonder if you know him... a certain Malduk."
CS_CH3_Main_20_029,"Malduk..!!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_030,"The Strategist of Angmund...? That Malduk?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_031,"Yes. He has been turning Orcs into undead since quite some time ago."
CS_CH3_Main_20_032,"He then lied to the Orcs, including Sieg, that the humans were to blame for the missing Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_20_033,"That nasty.."
CS_CH3_Main_20_034,"Why are you telling us all this?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_035,"Aren't you allied with the Demons?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_036,"I didn't like that bony bastard to begin with."
CS_CH3_Main_20_037,"Then...the reason you were trying to get the Goblins to confront the Orcs alongside Lakrak..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_038,"Yes, Malduk had taken advantage of the Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_20_039,"So, I took advantage of the Goblins, considering they hold a grudge towards the Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_20_040,"Malduk aside, you are really evil."
CS_CH3_Main_20_041,"Both sides will sustain terrible losses once they clash,"
CS_CH3_Main_20_042,"and the hatred between both sides will only grow larger!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_043,"So? As part of the Demon Army, I consider it a win if you idiots have a falling out."
CS_CH3_Main_20_044,"What?!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_045,"Damn... Trying to break apart the alliance between the races of this world..."
CS_CH3_Main_20_046,"We have to report this to Orvelia. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_047,"Fufufu, the Orvelians won't do anything about it."
CS_CH3_Main_20_048,"The royal family and the aristocrats will hole up in their little palace and think about how to survive, even if they have to throw away everything else."
CS_CH3_Main_20_049,"In the meanwhile... they'd try to kill you so the news doesn't spread."
CS_CH3_Main_20_050,"How dare you insult the Orvelian Royalty!!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_052,"Fufu... Naïve. Naïve as usual."
CS_CH3_Main_20_053,"Anyway, you wouldn't want to tell Orvelia about this. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_054,"Not that they would even be a match for the Demon Army, anyway."
CS_CH3_Main_20_055,"As things are right now, Orvel is an easy target - overthrowing it is nothing."
CS_CH3_Main_20_056,"So, mark my words. If you do as I say, an all-out war will not occur."
CS_CH3_Main_20_057,"And why should we trust you?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_058,"You don't need to."
CS_CH3_Main_20_059,"The choice is yours."
CS_CH3_Main_20_060,"Goodbye, then. We'll meet again."
CS_CH3_Main_20_061,"You old hag..! "
CS_CH3_Main_20_062,"Don't just leave like that! "
CS_CH3_Main_21_001,"Goddess Lua, please forgive Dain..."
CS_CH3_Main_21_002,"who made a dire choice for his master."
CS_CH3_Main_21_003,"I thank you for praying for my apprentice..."
CS_CH3_Main_21_004,"I assume it'd be easier to beat down Sieg rather than pursuade him."
CS_CH3_Main_21_005,"I'm pretty sure the Orcs will try to stop us."
CS_CH3_Main_21_006,"We'd have no choice but to beat them up in order to progress, Kaulah."
CS_CH3_Main_21_007,"I will come with you. I will try to...persuade them."
CS_CH3_Main_21_008,"If it doesn't work..."
CS_CH3_Main_21_009,"I will help you. I have already stained my hands with the blood of my kind."
CS_CH3_Main_21_010,"I'm sorry, Kaulah... for involving you in this situation. "
CS_CH3_Main_21_011,"This is not your fault, Kasel. "
CS_CH3_Main_21_012,"There will be bigger losses if we do not stop this war. We must try our best."
CS_CH3_Main_21_013,"Kasel, I agree with Maria.."
CS_CH3_Main_21_014,"You should wait before reporting this crisis to Orvelia. "
CS_CH3_Main_21_015,"I believe so too."
CS_CH3_Main_21_016,"The Laughing Masks... We don't know who they work for..."
CS_CH3_Main_21_017,"and whose will it is to kill me..."
CS_CH3_Main_21_018,"Kasel..."
CS_CH3_Main_21_019,"I'll find out one day, surely."
CS_CH3_Main_21_020,"But that's not what's important now. This comes first."
CS_CH3_Main_22_001,"Kaulah!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_002,"It's the traitor, Kaulah!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_003,"Comrades, We'd been fooled by the Demons. "
CS_CH3_Main_22_004,"Malduk, the Demon's strategist was the one who'd been kidnapping us Orcs and turning them into the undead.."
CS_CH3_Main_22_005,"Who would listen to a traitor's words!!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_006,"Pay for your sins with death, Kaulah! "
CS_CH3_Main_22_007,"I knew this would happen. "
CS_CH3_Main_22_008,"We can't give up on persuading them, Roi."
CS_CH3_Main_22_009,"Yeah, Roi, We should try our best!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_010,"*Sigh*... Cleo, How about reflecting on yourself a bit?"
CS_CH3_Main_22_011,"Later! We need to beat these guys up first!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_012,"Go easy on them, please."
CS_CH3_Main_23_001,"Hmm, there's a battle going on already."
CS_CH3_Main_23_002,"Wow... Lakrak is leading all those goblins and golems..."
CS_CH3_Main_23_003,"I don't like this...! Humph! "
CS_CH3_Main_24_001,"My experiment near end! Ach! "
CS_CH3_Main_24_002,"Leave now, make stronger weapon!!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_003,"Lakrak. What about the Goblins here following you.."
CS_CH3_Main_24_004,"Who care!!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_005,"Give golem control and machine, they do they want!! Kyak!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_006,"I follow you, I find strong test subject! "
CS_CH3_Main_24_007,"Wait bit! I follow after test, kyak!!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_008,"I'm up for that, my friend. "
CS_CH3_Main_24_009,"I'm not. I don't want to be on the same team with Goblins.."
CS_CH3_Main_24_010,"Cleo, no discrimination against the other races without reason."
CS_CH3_Main_24_011,"So..sorry.... Just don't tell me to sleep alone from now on."
CS_CH3_Main_24_012,"I can't fall asleep without Frey anymore.."
CS_CH3_Main_24_013,"Is this about that pillow thing..."
CS_CH3_Main_24_014,"Frey, you've got a small problem now, hahaha."
CS_CH3_Main_25_001,"Sieg!!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_002,"Is the one next to him Malduk?"
CS_CH3_Main_25_003,"I guess so. Look, skulls!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_004,"Sieg!! We were all deceived by him!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_005,"He blamed humans for all that he had done to the Orcs! He's the one who captured Orcs, turning them into undead! "
CS_CH3_Main_25_006,"What?!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_007,"Honorable High Chieftain,"
CS_CH3_Main_25_008,"a great warrior like you wouldn't have killed your most honored predecessor, Garuk, out of a small misunderstanding."
CS_CH3_Main_25_009,"Everything you did was for your race. For the sake of your tribe. "
CS_CH3_Main_25_010,"These imbeciles are insulting your decision, your honor."
CS_CH3_Main_25_011,"They must pay with their lives."
CS_CH3_Main_25_012,"...Yes."
CS_CH3_Main_25_013,"Indeed! I am the leader of Orcs. I will not forgive the humans that enslaved my kind! "
CS_CH3_Main_25_014,"That includes you, Kaulah! Pay for your betrayal!!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_015,"What a blockhead..."
CS_CH3_Main_25_017,"He just can't admit the truth. "
CS_CH3_Main_25_018,"The truth that he killed Garuk out of a misunderstanding..."
CS_CH3_Main_25_019,"Pay for your sins with death!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_26_001,"That's a High Chieftain. What strength..."
CS_CH3_Main_26_002,"Kasel, Can't you use the power of the holy sword?"
CS_CH3_Main_26_003,"I'm sorry... I... I'm not capable of controlling it yet.."
CS_CH3_Main_26_004,"The power just comes out on its own..."
CS_CH3_Main_26_005,"Jeez, don't apologize for everything!"
CS_CH3_Main_26_006,"We'll finish this somehow!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_001,"Kugh... Malduk.... Malduk!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_002,"I'm done for.... "
CS_CH3_Main_27_003,"Save my tribe... from those treacherous human beings. "
CS_CH3_Main_27_004,"Kukukukuku...."
CS_CH3_Main_27_005,"Kakaka..kahahahahahaha!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_006,"Idiotic Orc."
CS_CH3_Main_27_007,"Wha..what are you laughing at?!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_008,"The missing Orcs will soon rise again as undead"
CS_CH3_Main_27_009,"and become loyal members of the Demon Army."
CS_CH3_Main_27_010,"What...have I done.."
CS_CH3_Main_27_011,"You killed Garuk out of a small misunderstanding, that's all."
CS_CH3_Main_27_012,"Kukukuku....."
CS_CH3_Main_27_013,"Y....You...!!!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_014,"Guh....."
CS_CH3_Main_27_015,"Sieg!!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_016,"Did...did you really have to..."
CS_CH3_Main_27_017,"Did you have to laugh at a dying person, insulting their last moments!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_018,"Kukuku..."
CS_CH3_Main_27_019,"I see...Wielder of the holy sword..."
CS_CH3_Main_27_020,"How do you feel, hmm? Don't you feel any anger inside of you? "
CS_CH3_Main_27_021,"You... I will never forgive you!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_022,"Yes, that's right."
CS_CH3_Main_27_023,"Beautiful."
CS_CH3_Main_27_024,"Hahahaha!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_025,"Rage! Fury! Hate! More, more, stain the holy sword in even more darkness!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_026,"I hope the next time we cross paths, you will show me even greater hatred."
CS_CH3_Main_27_027,"Don't run, coward!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_028,"Damn, he lost us."
CS_CH3_Main_27_029,"Aaaaaaaah!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_030,"Guh... Kasel!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_031,"Kasel, no!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_032,"Stay strong, please..."
CS_CH3_Main_27_033,"Kugh..."
CS_CH3_Main_27_034,"Grrk...kugh..."
CS_CH3_Main_27_035,"Frey.. Th..Thank you.."
CS_CH3_Main_27_036,"Kasel! "
CS_CH3_Main_28_001,"Kasel... Kasel!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_28_002,"Ugh..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_003,"Malduk!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_28_004,"Calm down, Kasel. Malduk is gone."
CS_CH3_Main_28_005,"Is it because he left..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_006,"I think I went crazy for a bit there..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_007,"Yeah, but..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_008,"thanks to Frey, nothing went wrong."
CS_CH3_Main_28_009,"Frey called for Kasel, and then you came back to normal without any issues."
CS_CH3_Main_28_011,"Thank you, Frey. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_012,"Everything's okay, Kasel. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_013,"What about Sieg... what about the Orcs of Ogria."
CS_CH3_Main_28_014,"I will lead the tribe until the next chieftain is chosen. I'm the highest ranking shaman here so far."
CS_CH3_Main_28_015,"Don't worry about us. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_016,"Now that we've gained the talisman of Aeatola, we should transfer its power back into the holy sword."
CS_CH3_Main_28_017,"Not now..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_018,"Please, hold onto the talisman for now."
CS_CH3_Main_28_019,"Shouldn't you return its power? "
CS_CH3_Main_28_020,"I'm not capable of controlling Aea yet. It's too early..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_021,"If I fail to control the sword's power after it gets stronger..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_022,"I can't be sure who or where I'll be aiming the sword at...."
CS_CH3_Main_28_023,"Kasel..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_024,"Anyway, we should still figure out where the rest of the power is."
CS_CH3_Main_28_025,"It's still part of my mission."
CS_CH3_Main_28_026,"Of course. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_027,"I assume that the Northern Barbarians would have another portion of the power."
CS_CH3_Main_28_028,"Ugh..You mean the barbarian empire beyond the high cliff? I heard that even birds can't fly over that cliff."
CS_CH3_Main_28_029,"Correct. We have no choice but to pass through Galluah and Aegina."
CS_CH3_Main_28_030,"Which way is Galluah?"
CS_CH3_Main_28_031,"To the south."
CS_CH3_Main_28_032,"It will be a long trip."
CS_CH3_Main_28_033,"The Barbarian Empire... It will be our first time meeting humans of a different country, Kasel."
CS_CH3_Main_28_034,"Yeah, I hope we don't cause them any trouble."
CS_CH3_Main_28_035,"When I was inside the dark, I heard Frey's voice...it was weaker than before..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_036,"Someday... I might not be able to hear her voice at all"
CS_CH3_Main_28_037,"and sink into the abyss of darkness..."
CS_CH3_Main_28_038,"Before that, I have to give back the holy sword to my king."
CS_CH3_Main_28_039,"Now, though...I wonder if that’s the right thing to do."
CS_CH3_Main_29_001,"Did Malduk head to Galluah?"
CS_CH3_Main_29_002,"Yes. "
CS_CH3_Main_29_003,"I guess it would be too much to expect much from those greenhorns."
CS_CH3_Main_29_004,"If you expected them to kill Malduk..."
CS_CH3_Main_29_005,"Yes, I agree."
CS_CH3_Main_29_006,"I see."
CS_CH3_Main_29_007,"I think...I've become a little too talkative."
CS_CH3_Main_29_008,"There was plenty of time to forget everything..."
CS_CH3_Main_29_009,"I thought I had forgotten everything."
CS_CH3_Main_29_010,"But as soon as I saw her child...all my pent up anger and frustration bubbled up."
CS_CH3_Main_29_011,"Maria.."
CS_CH3_Main_29_012,"Fufufu..."
CS_CH3_Main_29_013,"Well, no matter."
CS_CH3_Main_29_014,"They are still puppets of Lua."
CS_CH3_Main_29_015,"Nothing I do will even register in comparison to what Lua has in store for them..."
CS_CH3_Main_29_016,"Did Epis head towards Galluah? "
CS_CH3_Main_29_017,"Yes. After she heard about you, she seemed to be in a hurry."
CS_CH3_Main_29_018,"Fufufu... Now all we have to do is to enjoy the puppet show in Galluah. "
CS_CH4_Main_0_001,"Ugh... This place is freaky."
CS_CH4_Main_0_002,"Of course. This land is called the Land of Death."
CS_CH4_Main_0_003,"Land of Death? "
CS_CH4_Main_0_004,"It's a land devastated by past wars."
CS_CH4_Main_0_005,"There used to be a number of human dukedoms in Galluah."
CS_CH4_Main_0_006,"They often warred with the Orc tribes,"
CS_CH4_Main_0_007,"but they were all destroyed after the sudden appearance of the Demon Army."
CS_CH4_Main_0_008,"Now, not a single sapient being exists in this land."
CS_CH4_Main_1_001,"Whoa, is that a floating sword with a mouth on it?"
CS_CH4_Main_1_002,"A living sword...!"
CS_CH4_Main_1_003,"Apparently Galluah has been completely overrun by Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_1_004,"Are those Demon weapons?"
CS_CH4_Main_1_005,"Not exactly. Those aren't really weapons, they're actually Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_1_006,"The Demon's World, which is called the World of Darkness, has no form."
CS_CH4_Main_1_007,"The entities from that world also have no form."
CS_CH4_Main_1_008,"So when the Demons crossed over the Gate into this world, Angmund gave them material form."
CS_CH4_Main_1_009,"Also, as he corrupted the land, he injected the souls of Demons into the entities of this world."
CS_CH4_Main_1_010,"These beings are all categorized as Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_1_011,"Living equipment like that living sword are also part of the latter type of Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_1_012,"It's my first time seeing these Demons, but low class Demons such as these aren't a problem for an archmage such as myself!"
CS_CH4_Main_2_001,"Hmm.. If the world of darkness has no form..."
CS_CH4_Main_2_002,"would Lua and the World of Light exist under the same rules?"
CS_CH4_Main_2_003,"Yes. Lua too is a spiritual existence,"
CS_CH4_Main_2_004,"but she materializes herself when she shows herself to us in this world."
CS_CH4_Main_2_005,"The World of Light is also called the realm of the gods,"
CS_CH4_Main_2_006,"and it is said that they can create any kind of element or material."
CS_CH4_Main_2_007,"Magicians thus categorize our world as 'The Material World',"
CS_CH4_Main_2_008,"to distinguish it from the other formless worlds."
CS_CH4_Main_2_009,"I know you guys are brawny rather than brainy, but this much is basic knowledge. Remember it!"
CS_CH4_Sub_1_001,"Golems again, huh."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_002,"They must be Galluan Golems, created by the human dukedoms for their wars against the Orcs."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_003,"Now, however...it seems the Demons control them."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_004,"We should have borrowed a golem controller from Lakrak. "
CS_CH4_Sub_1_005,"*Sigh*...blade users..."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_006,"Once a golem is under the control of a person, nobody can hijack that particular golem."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_007,"Golems that have lost their masters and deactivated are a different case, though."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_001,"Ugh. Are those the rumoured beasts afflicted by the Dark Disease?"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_002,"They look much worse than what the rumours say..."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_003,"Poor animals...The skin is all ripped apart, and the bones are poking out of its body..."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_004,"Is the Dark Disease also caused by the Demons?"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_005,"It's hard to say it is..."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_006,"but there is a connection between the two."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_007,"I think I mentioned this in Ellidora, "
CS_CH4_Sub_2_008,"but remember when I said there are cases of Demons taking over animals?"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_009,"Yes. I remember. "
CS_CH4_Sub_2_010,"The Dark Disease is a side effect of that case."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_011,"The afflicted animal struggles in pain, hurting itself in the process."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_012,"Considering the bones...I'd say this one has been afflicted for a few months."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_013,"That's around the time that the Demons began to re-emerge. "
CS_CH4_Sub_2_014,"We need to put these poor children to rest."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_001,"If the disease is triggered by the corruption of Darkness,"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_002,"Would the dryads and harpies of Ellidora be okay?"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_003,"We don't have to worry about them for now. "
CS_CH4_Sub_3_004,"The Nucleus of Darkness is structured in a different way,"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_005,"in comparison to how Demons control animals."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_006,"How do you know that? "
CS_CH4_Sub_3_007,"I took a few samples of the destroyed Nucleus for study."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_008,"Did you really think I'd overlook such a dangerous item without studying it?"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_009,"Ha, you really did well, Cleo."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_010,"Ew...It's weird to hear you compliment me."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_011,"*Sigh*...give me back my gratitude."
CS_CH4_Main_3_001,"Hm? What is it, Kasel?"
CS_CH4_Main_3_002,"Kasel... Don't be anxious. You are not a helpless child anymore."
CS_CH4_Main_3_003,"I'm fine. I was just... a little surprised."
CS_CH4_Main_3_004,"You don't seem like your usual self, Kasel."
CS_CH4_Main_3_005,"It's a vague memory... but when I was younger, my village was attacked by Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_3_006,"seeing that Demon just...reminded me of that day. It's ok. I'm fine."
CS_CH4_Main_3_007,"Let's get rid of those enemies and continue on our way."
CS_CH4_Main_4_001,"Huff...huff..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_002,"You okay, Kasel? "
CS_CH4_Main_4_003,"Yeah I'm fine. They weren't that strong, really."
CS_CH4_Main_4_004,"Fufu, see? You are no more the kid who used to cry every time when faced with a skeleton model."
CS_CH4_Main_4_005,"Come on, Frey. Don't remind me of that."
CS_CH4_Main_4_006,"What is it, what is it??"
CS_CH4_Main_4_007,"When we were still children living at the orphanage,"
CS_CH4_Main_4_008,"the principal brought a skeleton model to class to teach us about the human body."
CS_CH4_Main_4_009,"Kasel got extremely frightened and started to cry."
CS_CH4_Main_4_010,"Everyone, including me started teasing him about being a crybaby..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_011,"Frey made fun of someone!? "
CS_CH4_Main_4_012,"Well, it was when she was young."
CS_CH4_Main_4_013,"On the other hand, I'd say your mental age is the same as back then..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_014,"*Sigh*...and you just complemented me moments ago..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_015,"It wasn't worth it, so yeah."
CS_CH4_Main_4_016,"When I heard the story of Kasel's family and the Demon invasion afterwards, I felt really bad about it..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_017,"Perhaps Lua gave me the task of helping Kasel,"
CS_CH4_Main_4_018,"because I made fun of him back then."
CS_CH4_Main_4_019,"Tiring, isn't it?"
CS_CH4_Main_4_020,"Pshhh..it was a joke, Kasel. A joke! "
CS_CH4_Main_4_021,"I don't know how you feel about it, but I am happy that Lua chose me."
CS_CH4_Main_4_022,"Oh...Frey is making jokes. This is new."
CS_CH4_Main_4_023,"Silly, wasn't I? Haha... old memories..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_024,"Silly, huh. If you think that's silly, just take a look at Cleo."
CS_CH4_Main_4_025,"Roi!!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_4_026,"It suits Cleo to be bright and cheerful. But I should act like a priest."
CS_CH4_Main_4_027,"Yes...because I am a priest,"
CS_CH4_Main_4_028,"I can follow the path Lua wants me to."
CS_CH4_Main_4_029,"But Kasel..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_030,"I suppose Lua wouldn't remove Kasel's burden even if I prayed for it..."
CS_CH4_Main_5_001,"Eww, what is that giant head?!"
CS_CH4_Main_5_002,"It looks like the skull of giants that lived here in ancient times. "
CS_CH4_Main_5_003,"Those actually existed...?"
CS_CH4_Main_5_004,"Before the Demons invaded 100 years ago,"
CS_CH4_Main_5_005,"people believed that the World of Light and Darkness were just fables and myths."
CS_CH4_Main_5_006,"The fact that legend of giants was true doesn't even surprise me now."
CS_CH4_Main_5_007,"*Sigh*...Malduk..."
CS_CH4_Main_5_008,"He really went and made all kinds of weird undead!"
CS_CH4_Main_5_009,"Malduk did this?"
CS_CH4_Main_5_010,"Yeah, stupid Roi wouldn't know, would he?"
CS_CH4_Main_5_011,"Malduk was Angmund's strategist, but he is also called the Father of Undead."
CS_CH4_Main_5_012,"He's the one who infused Demon souls into dead bodies."
CS_CH4_Main_5_013,"Some people say Malduk himself underwent the same process when he came to this world through the gate. "
CS_CH4_Main_5_014,"Those skeletons are much more difficult to deal with compared to living weapons,"
CS_CH4_Main_5_015,"probably because there were once alive, too."
CS_CH4_Main_6_001,"Hasn't it become darker around here?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_002,"Cleo...Can you feel this?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_003,"Yes...This is bad...I sense some really dangerous mana..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_004,"Dangerous mana... Referring to yourself, hmm?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_005,"Wh..Who are you!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_006,"I am you. The poor little girl with dangerous magic power, abandoned by her parents."
CS_CH4_Main_6_007,"What?! Don't make me laugh."
CS_CH4_Main_6_008,"Hahaha, yes, you too. I can't help laughing at the sight of you."
CS_CH4_Main_6_009,"You act big to hide your loneliness in the day, and cry over your mother in the night.. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_010,"You say you left to find your mother, but I know the truth. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_011,"You just didn't want to stay in the Tower of the Sage."
CS_CH4_Main_6_012,"All the people you hurt due to your powerful magic."
CS_CH4_Main_6_013,"You just wanted to run away from them and their cold gazes, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_014,"Now tell me. Are you really seeking for your mother?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_015,"The fact is, you're scared, aren't you? Scared of meeting your mother, the one who gave you your mana."
CS_CH4_Main_6_016,"The one who threw you away, even before you could remember her face/"
CS_CH4_Main_6_017,"What...who do you think you are?!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_018,"I'm Cleo. The poor, lonely girl who can't stop crying in her sleep without Frey."
CS_CH4_Main_6_019,"I'd rather fall asleep next to Frey forever than go through the painful search for my mom..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_020,"How long will that be possible..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_021,"You idiot! How can you call yourself an archmage, being tricked by something like this!?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_022,"Hahaha, like you ever acknowledged Cleo as an archmage."
CS_CH4_Main_6_023,"Who are you!? What is your goal?!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_024,"You still haven't figured it out?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_025,"I am you. The Dark Reaper, Roi."
CS_CH4_Main_6_026,"C'mon. It's dark outside, so it's time to go to work. Like any other time, the reward will be big."
CS_CH4_Main_6_027,"Considering we're taking the lives of upstanding people, there's no way the reward can be small, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_028,"Let's see... How much for the heads of those three idiots?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_029,"Shut up!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_030,"Shut up? What do you mean, shut up."
CS_CH4_Main_6_031,"You had this conversation a few years ago with your old Laughing Mask friends, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_032,"Stop...not in front of Cleo and the others..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_033,"Haha, why? Why not?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_034,"What are you afraid of? "
CS_CH4_Main_6_035,"Are you afraid that those naïve children following after the light will be disgusted of you for trading lives with money?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_036,"C'mon, Roi. You don't belong with them."
CS_CH4_Main_6_037,"You are the Dark Reaper."
CS_CH4_Main_6_038,"I... I......am..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_039,"The Roi of now doesn't do such things!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_040,"The past is the past!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_041,"Do you really think so?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_042,"The past is a mirror, reflecting your future self."
CS_CH4_Main_6_043,"Like how all those townspeople died...and like how Brian died,"
CS_CH4_Main_6_044,"people will continue to die because of you in the future."
CS_CH4_Main_6_045,"As long as the holy sword is in your hand, you cannot change that future. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_046,"So, let go of the sword."
CS_CH4_Main_6_047,"Buf if I do...this world will...."
CS_CH4_Main_6_048,"If you are that worried about the world, there is still a way."
CS_CH4_Main_6_049,"You must die."
CS_CH4_Main_6_050,"Yes, you."
CS_CH4_Main_6_051,"That way, the holy sword will be passed down to the true savior of the world."
CS_CH4_Main_6_052,"You always say you would give up your life to save others, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_053,"The lives of everyone of this world. You can save all of them, just by dying."
CS_CH4_Main_6_054,"Don't listen, Kasel!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_055,"Goddess Lua.. Please protect us. Bless us with your Light."
CS_CH4_Main_6_056,"I'm sorry, Frey. The goddess will never listen to your prayer."
CS_CH4_Main_6_057,"You know it... but you still recite your prayers, only in habit."
CS_CH4_Main_6_058,"Of course, you lived in the church...it's obvious you would pick up such habits."
CS_CH4_Main_6_059,"That's not true. My faith towards Lua is real! "
CS_CH4_Main_6_060,"Yes, you resent her for real. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_061,"Much like Clause, you resent her for giving Kasel such a heavy burden."
CS_CH4_Main_6_062,"I am you. I know everything about you."
CS_CH4_Main_6_063,"In fact, you resent her even more than Clause does because you have to continue following him around."
CS_CH4_Main_6_064,"That's not it. I appreciate the journey she's given to me. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_065,"*Sigh*...Frey, who would have guessed you would have become a priest."
CS_CH4_Main_6_066,"People are impossible to understand, due to their whimsical nature."
CS_CH4_Main_6_067,"You say you appreciate this journey, but till when?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_068,"As time goes, you will tire of it. And you will abandon Kasel."
CS_CH4_Main_6_069,"...You're right. I've changed my mind many times in my life...and it will continue to do so."
CS_CH4_Main_6_070,"But..that isn't the only driving force behind life."
CS_CH4_Main_6_071,"Even if my resolve is weak, I can regain it."
CS_CH4_Main_6_072,"The strength of strong will,"
CS_CH4_Main_6_073,"is the present that Lua has given to us!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_074,"Ah...ah...."
CS_CH4_Main_6_075,"No.. Please don't.. Frey..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_076,"I'm done...tired..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_077,"You need to follow your heart...where it leads you..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_078,"You said you were me?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_079,"That is a lie."
CS_CH4_Main_6_080,"One day, in the future, I may tire of everything."
CS_CH4_Main_6_081,"Perhaps then, I may suffer like you have said."
CS_CH4_Main_6_082,"But that time is not now. Right now...I am following my own path sincerely!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_083,"Your evil words will no longer enter my ears."
CS_CH4_Main_6_084,"By Lua's name, I command you. Leave now, Demon!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_085,"Wow, telling me to leave just as I arrive is just mean, isn't it?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_086,"My, you are..."
CS_CH4_Main_6_087,"Are you behind all of this?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_088,"Nope, nope."
CS_CH4_Main_6_089,"I just came here to see what kind of fun things were happening inside Malduk's trap, as it was starting to break down."
CS_CH4_Main_6_090,"Malduk's trap!?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_091,"I'll tell you the details later."
CS_CH4_Main_6_092,"The darkness failed to consume you, so it'll try to attack you physically."
CS_CH4_Main_6_093,"Sour grapes, indeed."
CS_CH4_Main_6_094,"Look over there!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_095,"Now, its been a long time since I had some toys to have fun with."
CS_CH4_Main_7_001,"Fu~~~~it's been a long time since I've had such fun!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_002,"You seem to be one of the Demons, why are you helping us? "
CS_CH4_Main_7_003,"Us? Ah, are you friends with those dazed humans?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_004,"I guess I should wake them up."
CS_CH4_Main_7_005,"Let's see~ I'm Demon, so I should do it in a Demon-like way!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_006,"I guess they'll come to if I cut your throat with this scythe, ufufu..."
CS_CH4_Main_7_007,"Wh...What...?! You Demon..!!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_008,"Damn...and I thought she was trying to help us..."
CS_CH4_Main_7_009,"My dagger will be faster than your scythe, Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_7_010,"Success~!! Hahahaha."
CS_CH4_Main_7_011,"Wh..what?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_012,"C'mon, see? All of you woke up!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_013,"Why would I chop up this priest lady? She's too fun!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_014,"Hmm...It seems you're the youngest human to ever make a crack in Malduk's trap."
CS_CH4_Main_7_015,"Ah~You must be the most interesting human I met in a long time!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_016,"....Are you...Epis? The thrill seeking Demon?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_017,"Oho, you know me?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_018,"Epis!!? Wow, I get to meet Epis!! Journeying around with Kasel sure has its perks!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_019,"The Demon Hero who helped save this world 100 years ago after passing through the Gate,"
CS_CH4_Main_7_020,"only because this world was 'fun'...."
CS_CH4_Main_7_021,"Are you really that Epis??"
CS_CH4_Main_7_022,"Hahaha, you humans are really funny!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_023,"Even when your lifespans are so short, you like to remember the past."
CS_CH4_Main_8_001,"So that...was a trap made by Malduk?"
CS_CH4_Main_8_002,"Yep."
CS_CH4_Main_8_003,"It's a magic trap that materializes the inner darkness of any sapient lifeform, in order to corrupt them."
CS_CH4_Main_8_004,"Malduk... How distasteful."
CS_CH4_Main_8_005,"I agree. Still, I think that trap isn't a solo job by Malduk."
CS_CH4_Main_8_006,"Think about it. We used to exist in a place with no life."
CS_CH4_Main_8_007,"It's not possible that a Demon would just know how to analyze the inner darkness of a living being without prior experience."
CS_CH4_Main_8_008,"That makes sense."
CS_CH4_Main_8_009,"So somebody from this world helped the Demons..."
CS_CH4_Main_8_010,"Who in the world would..."
CS_CH4_Main_8_011,"The one who opened the Gate was a human."
CS_CH4_Main_8_012,"Legend says it was some crazy mage that made a mistake..."
CS_CH4_Main_8_013,"But perhaps he was actually with the Demons..."
CS_CH4_Main_8_014,"Malduk..."
CS_CH4_Main_8_015,"He laid low for quite some time, but apparently he used this trap in Ogria recently as well."
CS_CH4_Main_8_016,"In Ogria?!!"
CS_CH4_Main_8_017,"Yeah, apparently there was an Orc suffering a huge inferiority complex towards humans."
CS_CH4_Main_8_018,"He was asking why the Goddess favored humans, or something.around those lines."
CS_CH4_Main_8_019,"That makes no sense. The Goddess loves all races equally."
CS_CH4_Main_8_020,"Excuse me, lady? I'm a Demon, so I don't know about those things."
CS_CH4_Main_8_021,"But the Holy Sword itself is an issue."
CS_CH4_Main_8_022,"The Orcs were proud to consider themselves the strongest warriors,"
CS_CH4_Main_8_023,"but then Lua went and granted the humans the holy sword 100 years ago."
CS_CH4_Main_8_024,"Apparently that was a part of the issue."
CS_CH4_Main_8_025,"So they were thinking about that..."
CS_CH4_Main_8_026,"So then the strongest warrior went and fell into that particular trap."
CS_CH4_Main_8_027,"...Sieg?"
CS_CH4_Main_8_028,"Yeah. I think that’s the name."
CS_CH4_Main_8_029,"Ugh... So when you get caught in that trap, you turn as stubborn as a brick wall."
CS_CH4_Main_8_030,"No need to worry, Cleo."
CS_CH4_Main_8_031,"Your bullheadedness is already enough to give anyone indigestion and constipation at the same time."
CS_CH4_Main_8_032,"Roi, you jerk!!"
CS_CH4_Main_8_033,"Um.. You guys...? I have a question."
CS_CH4_Main_8_034,"I know what being stubborn or bullheaded means, even indigestion, but what is constipation?"
CS_CH4_Main_8_035,"...This....I must record this!"
CS_CH4_Main_8_036,"Demons don't know what constipation is, thus they don't have to go to the toilet..."
CS_CH4_Main_9_001,"Whoa! Hey, you!"
CS_CH4_Main_9_002,"Sorry?"
CS_CH4_Main_9_003,"You...that sword...it's Aea?!"
CS_CH4_Main_9_004,"Ah...come to think of it, you were Kyle's friend, so you would know about this sword."
CS_CH4_Main_9_005,"You...you cute little brat."
CS_CH4_Main_9_006,"And to think you were playing dumb while we were talking about the past before."
CS_CH4_Main_9_007,"I just thought it would be better that the people didn't know the holy sword had reappeard,"
CS_CH4_Main_9_008,"so it became a habit not to speak of it when the topic came up."
CS_CH4_Main_9_009,"You humans sure are a headache."
CS_CH4_Main_9_010,"Well, that's part of what makes you interesting. Fufufu.."
CS_CH4_Main_9_011,"That trap from before...if Malduk was responsible of it,"
CS_CH4_Main_9_012,"is he still around in Galluah?"
CS_CH4_Main_9_013,"Most likely, yes."
CS_CH4_Main_9_014,"He probably already received a report about you all from the skeletons around here."
CS_CH4_Main_10_001,"Hm? Those Golems..they feel different from the others we've seen so far."
CS_CH4_Main_10_002,"Do you think they still hold the power of the dukedoms of the past?"
CS_CH4_Main_10_003,"Hmm..I don't know much about the magic of that era,"
CS_CH4_Main_10_004,"but that is the most likely conclusion."
CS_CH4_Main_11_001,"Hmm...those golems seem to be guarding that coffin."
CS_CH4_Main_11_002,"A coffin, eh? Isn't that what you humans throw your dead into?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_003,"Those are ceremonial rites."
CS_CH4_Main_11_004,"I'm a Demon, don't expect me to understand all your customs and courtesies."
CS_CH4_Main_11_005,"This is the Material World, where life and death go hand in hand."
CS_CH4_Main_11_006,"Since you are in our world, you would be expected to follow our customs."
CS_CH4_Main_11_007,"Yeah! You're here now, so act like it!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_008,"It just doesn't click when you talk about customs and courtesies, Cleo."
CS_CH4_Main_11_008_0,"Why?!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_009,"Ack!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_010,"The corpse walked out of its coffin!!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_011,"Get lost...Demons..."
CS_CH4_Main_11_012,"Eh? Why is she calling us Demons?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_013,"Oh, right. Epis is a Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_11_014,"In that case..."
CS_CH4_Main_11_015,"Let's get out of here, Cleo. It seems this is a fight between Demon and Undead."
CS_CH4_Main_11_016,"We have nothing to do with this."
CS_CH4_Main_11_017,"What was that for, you jerk!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_018,"Did you forget what I did with that trap for you?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_019,"Nah, I just thought a corpse would be nothing for you... "
CS_CH4_Main_11_020,"C'mon, battles are only fun when done together!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_021,"Do you think it would be fun for me to just wait alone for my mana gauge to fill up and then spam skills?!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_022,"Ri...right."
CS_CH4_Main_11_023,"Kuku, did Roi just get yelled at by a Demon hero?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_024,"Shut up! We don't know what this enemy can do."
CS_CH4_Main_11_025,"Stay focused, or we may lose!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_026,"Boooooring."
CS_CH4_Main_11_027,"Fufu, I think it's funny. See, he's trying to cover up his embarassment with a façade of seriousness!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_001,"Kyahaha, you're quite interesting! An undead using its coffin as a weapon..! "
CS_CH4_Main_12_002,"Did Malduk make you, too?"
CS_CH4_Main_12_003,"Malduk..!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_004,"Hm? She's reacting to Malduk's name."
CS_CH4_Main_12_005,"Who...was that? I don't remember anything...I only know I must destroy Demons..."
CS_CH4_Main_12_006,"The name...Malduk....kind of familiar..."
CS_CH4_Main_12_007,"Really? We are looking for Malduk. Do you want to come with us? "
CS_CH4_Main_12_008,"Excuse me, we are not looking for Malduk. "
CS_CH4_Main_12_009,"We were on our way to the Barbarian Kingdom, it just so happened that we passed by here."
CS_CH4_Main_12_010,"Come on~ don't be a party pooper."
CS_CH4_Main_12_011,"If the hero of the holy sword heard that Malduk was in Galluah,"
CS_CH4_Main_12_012,"wouldn't it be obvious that he should go check it out?"
CS_CH4_Main_12_013,"Well, we didn't consider that."
CS_CH4_Main_12_014,"But it seems we'll meet him even if we didn't want to."
CS_CH4_Main_12_015,"Considering he even set up a trap for us..."
CS_CH4_Main_12_016,"I guess you're right."
CS_CH4_Main_12_017,"However...I don't think letting her meet Malduk is a good plan."
CS_CH4_Main_12_018,"Why? I think it would be a fun sight."
CS_CH4_Main_12_019,"Malduk...I want to meet..."
CS_CH4_Main_12_020,"See? The Undead lady wants to meet him!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_021,"C'mon, lets go!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_022,"This is exciting!! I wonder what fun things will happen when they meet..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_001,"Hmm..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_002,"What's the matter?"
CS_CH4_Main_13_003,"I'd thought this undead lady was made by Malduk.."
CS_CH4_Main_13_004,"But it's odd."
CS_CH4_Main_13_005,"This isn't how Malduk does things!"
CS_CH4_Main_13_006,"Look! I found something!"
CS_CH4_Main_13_007,"There's a name written on the coffin. 'Jane Gray?'"
CS_CH4_Main_13_008,"I suppose it's her name when she was alive."
CS_CH4_Main_13_009,"Then.."
CS_CH4_Main_13_010,"Do you know something?"
CS_CH4_Main_13_011,"When the Demons invaded this world, "
CS_CH4_Main_13_012,"There was a particular dukedom ruled by some people named the Grays fought back against the Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_13_013,"This lady must be part of that country."
CS_CH4_Main_13_014,"Gray..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_015,"Then those guardian golems..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_016,"They were probably trying to guard Jane Grey as golems of the Dukedom."
CS_CH4_Main_13_017,"Is that why Jane was hostile towards Epis right after waking up?"
CS_CH4_Main_13_018,"At that time, it was just fun to kill things here."
CS_CH4_Main_13_019,"Well, it hadn't been long since I had received a body..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_020,"We just did anything Angmund asked of us...everything was fun."
CS_CH4_Main_13_021,"Sorry to make you remember..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_022,"Eh, please. I'm still a Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_13_023,"I don't feel as much guilt as you may assume."
CS_CH4_Main_13_024,"No need for you to make that face."
CS_CH4_Main_13_025,"For a Demon, you sure read faces well."
CS_CH4_Main_13_026,"Come on, I lived far longer here in this world than any of you."
CS_CH4_Main_13_027,"Facial Expressions... are easy to read. I consider myself better than most humans in that regard."
CS_CH4_Main_13_028,"But..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_029,"This one here, even I can't figure out what she's thinking."
CS_CH4_Main_14_001,"Malduk...!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_002,"It's been a long time~ Malduk."
CS_CH4_Main_14_003,"You... the traitor, Epis!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_004,"Fufu, isn't it nice? Reminds me of the old times."
CS_CH4_Main_14_005,"You...you...how did you find the holy sword, Aea?!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_006,"Eh, rather than finding it...it just came by like fate?"
CS_CH4_Main_14_007,"Fufu, even though I'm a Demon, "
CS_CH4_Main_14_008,"I sure must have some kind of connection with the Goddess of these parts, Lua."
CS_CH4_Main_14_009,"Hmph... At any rate, I will deal with you later, traitor."
CS_CH4_Main_14_010,"I have some urgent business to take care of. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_011,"You...are Malduk?"
CS_CH4_Main_14_012,"Yes I am, my daughter."
CS_CH4_Main_14_013,"I am your father. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_014,"Father..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_015,"Psh...well."
CS_CH4_Main_14_016,"Considering you are called the Father of Undead, that really isn't untrue..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_017,"However...my daughter, you have been sullied."
CS_CH4_Main_14_018,"Who tainted you to this extent?"
CS_CH4_Main_14_019,"I...dirty..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_020,"Don't listen to that bastard, Jane! "
CS_CH4_Main_14_021,"You were a human long ago. He only raised you from the dead!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_022,"She's right, Miss Jane. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_023,"Malduk had disgraced your eternal sleep."
CS_CH4_Main_14_024,"But... I...feel...stuffy..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_025,"I don't remember anything but the name...Malduk..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_026,"Yes, follow me, your father. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_027,"You have no one but me."
CS_CH4_Main_14_028,"Jane, Malduk is a Demon. You wanted to get rid of the Demons, remember? "
CS_CH4_Main_14_029,"My daughter, you can eliminate the Demons anytime you want. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_030,"When you get your memory back..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_031,"if you still feel the Demons must be purged, then I will die happily by your hand."
CS_CH4_Main_14_032,"Don't lie, Malduk!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_033,"I'll come with you, Malduk."
CS_CH4_Main_14_034,"Good bye, everyone."
CS_CH4_Main_14_035,"No, Jane!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_036,"My daughter, no need to be sad. You will meet them again soon."
CS_CH4_Main_15_001,"Frey was right. We shouldn't have let Jane meet Malduk..!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_002,"Hmm. I think differently."
CS_CH4_Main_15_003,"Thanks to this turn of events, I have an interesting hypothesis"
CS_CH4_Main_15_004,"An interersting hypothesis~!? You demon!!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_005,"No wait, you are a demon! You devil!!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_006,"How can be so hedonistic even as we lost Jane to Malduk!!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_007,"Malduk's goal from the start...was probably Jane."
CS_CH4_Main_15_008,"Even if we didn't bring her here, Malduk would have found her anyway..."
CS_CH4_Main_15_009,"Okay, so what is this 'interesting hypothesis'?"
CS_CH4_Main_15_010,"Malduk said Jane had been tainted. "
CS_CH4_Main_15_011,"Malduk probably is the one that turned Jane into an Undead..."
CS_CH4_Main_15_012,"but it seems someone else tampered with her and overrode the magic on her body."
CS_CH4_Main_15_013,"If that is true...does it mean it is possible to grant a personality to undead?"
CS_CH4_Main_15_014,"Perhaps."
CS_CH4_Main_15_015,"I didn't consider that much, but it makes sense."
CS_CH4_Main_15_016,"If that's so, I wonder who cast such magic on Jane..."
CS_CH4_Main_15_017,"Considering she remembers parts of her past..."
CS_CH4_Main_16_001,"Eh, Malduk? You were still in Galluah?"
CS_CH4_Main_16_002,"Kukuku, did you really think I'd ignore the wielder of the holy sword?"
CS_CH4_Main_16_003,"Where is Jane? "
CS_CH4_Main_16_004,"You'll meet my daughter soon."
CS_CH4_Main_16_005,"Because you will become my sons and daughters, too!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_16_006,"That's preposterous! "
CS_CH4_Main_17_001,"Kuhahahaha, you fight well, even when you haven't completed the power of the holy sword."
CS_CH4_Main_17_002,"As a reward, I will let you meet my daughter."
CS_CH4_Main_18_001,"Jane!"
CS_CH4_Main_18_002,"My daughter and loyal subordinate. 'His' useful tool."
CS_CH4_Main_18_003,"It is time to repay his grace."
CS_CH4_Main_18_004,"This 'He' seems quite famous."
CS_CH4_Main_18_005,"Perhaps...the Dark Lord, Angmund?"
CS_CH4_Main_18_006,"No, that's impossible. I didn't feel his power in 100 years."
CS_CH4_Main_18_007,"In the time we existed in the World of Darkness, we could always feel his power somewhere."
CS_CH4_Main_18_008,"I don't know if he is really dead, or has gone back to the World of Darkness,"
CS_CH4_Main_18_009,"but since he disappeared from this world, no Demon ever felt his presence anymore."
CS_CH4_Main_18_010,"Hello, everyone."
CS_CH4_Main_18_011,"Let's be together with Him..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_012,"Accept your death, and wake up again..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_013,"Your death...I will grant..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_014,"No...!"
CS_CH4_Main_18_015,"Wake up, Jane!!"
CS_CH4_Main_18_016,"Accept it, Cleo. Jane Gray is already a dead person. "
CS_CH4_Main_18_017,"He's right, Cleo. "
CS_CH4_Main_18_018,"If Jane tries to kill us... we can only fight her back..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_019,"No matter what... "
CS_CH4_Main_18_020,"the burden we carry now is that of the world."
CS_CH4_Main_18_021,"Yes..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_022,"We're sorry, Jane. We can't die yet."
CS_CH4_Main_18_023,"And more than anything, we won't become the puppets of Demons!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_19_001,"Kuhahahaha, the holy sword is still powerful even when incomplete. "
CS_CH4_Main_19_002,"But you guys are yet too weak...weak to be of help to 'Him'."
CS_CH4_Main_19_003,"I don't know who that is, but we will never help the Demons!!"
CS_CH4_Main_19_004,"Fufu, when did I ever ask you to be of help to Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_19_005,"Fools, who don't even know who their true enemy is..Kuhahaha."
CS_CH4_Main_19_006,"Thank you for this sample of your strength."
CS_CH4_Main_19_007,"I will use this experience well, in the future. Hahahaha..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_001,"*Sigh*....Not again...he ran off again!!"
CS_CH4_Main_20_002,"Jane, you're still alive!!"
CS_CH4_Main_20_003,"I'm...not..alive..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_004,"Oh, right..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_005,"So you don't want to kill us anymore..?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_006,"You rejected to become like me...."
CS_CH4_Main_20_007,"I hate you..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_008,"I don't need you all...."
CS_CH4_Main_20_009,"Is she...mad?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_010,"Hmm... I can't read her."
CS_CH4_Main_20_011,"I guess I still have ways to go."
CS_CH4_Main_20_012,"I doubt even a thousand-year old sage would be able to read the expressions of a dead body."
CS_CH4_Main_20_013,"Jane, you received 'His' grace..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_014,"Do you know who that is?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_015,"Won't tell you...I hate you..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_016,"Come on, this is ridiculous..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_017,"See, Jane. I'm a Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_20_018,"Technically, Undead are also Demons. So why not tell me?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_019,"Demon working with people I hate...I don't need you..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_020,"*Sigh*...Heroes of Light, I think we need a little time to ourselves."
CS_CH4_Main_20_021,"Us of the Darkness need some time...to do a little bonding."
CS_CH4_Main_20_022,"Persuade her...please."
CS_CH4_Main_20_023,"I dunno how it will go. Well, can't be helped even if it goes wrong."
CS_CH4_Main_20_024,"Jane Gray is an interesting one."
CS_CH4_Main_20_025,"Even if I don't learn who 'He' is, it will be fun."
CS_CH4_Main_20_026,"I mean, you all are fun too, but this seems a little more interesting."
CS_CH4_Main_20_027,"Sorry, Jane. We need to go now."
CS_CH4_Main_20_028,"When you don't feel mad anymore, I would like it if you came with us."
CS_CH4_Main_20_029,"I'll bring her along when she stops pouting."
CS_CH4_Main_20_030,"You were all headed for the Barbarian Kingdom, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_031,"In that case, you need to pass through Arrovina."
CS_CH4_Main_20_032,"Exactly, yes."
CS_CH4_Main_20_033,"I'll see you all later."
CS_CH4_Main_20_034,"I'll be expecting good news. "
CS_CH5_Main_0_001,"I thought the weather would be better once we left Galluah, but it seems I was mistaken."
CS_CH5_Main_0_002,"Because Galluah was corrupted with dark magic, light does not spread well."
CS_CH5_Main_0_003,"Arrovina on the other hand, is naturally dim."
CS_CH5_Main_0_004,"The rain and fog blots out the sun most of the time."
CS_CH5_Main_0_005,"There is a theory that the elves of this area adapted to the environment,"
CS_CH5_Main_0_006,"and because of that their skin color became dark...well, it's just an unproven hypothesis."
CS_CH5_Main_0_007,"I heard that the current King of the Dark Elves is pretty young."
CS_CH5_Main_0_008,"Young in comparison to the general lifespan of an elf, you mean. He's still 130 years old."
CS_CH5_Main_0_009,"I heard most of the royal bloodline died during the Demon invasion."
CS_CH5_Main_0_010,"Only one prince made it out alive. King Temorel was 30 years old back then."
CS_CH5_Main_0_011,"He is the current ruler of Dark Elves. "
CS_CH5_Sub_1_001,"My, what a cute little turtle."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_002,"I heard turtles are really delicious when cooked well. .."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_003,"Wait..."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_004,"That lion...seems to be controlled by the darkness."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_005,"It's not an ordinary lion, that’s for sure."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_006,"Is that what a fully corrupted animal looks like? "
CS_CH5_Sub_1_007,"That is a case of enhancement through complete corruption."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_008,"That is what happens when the corruption succeeds, instead of failing and turning into the Dark Disease."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_009,"I hear corrupted animals affect any other animals nearby, turning them into ferocious beasts."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_010,"Then..."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_011,"We have to fight that cute turtle..."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_012,"On the plus side, we can make some turtle soup..."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_013,"*Sigh*...Kasel..."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_001,"Considering our current goal is to reach the Aegina Desert..."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_002,"Would it be faster to go north?"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_003,"The land looks rather unstable around that path."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_004,"Cleo, can we fly the distance using your magic staff, like before?"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_005,"I'm against that."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_006,"Fufu, Roi seemed to quite scared last time."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_007,"Well, I won't deny it wasn't very pleasant."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_008,"Also, it seemed you were having a hard time flying as it is last time."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_009,"Considering we don't know how far the unstable ground will last..."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_010,"It could be dangerous to fly off without properly gauging the distance."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_011,"True. Well then, even if we have to take a longer detour, shall we walk south?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_001,"Those are... Gnolls.!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_002,"*Sigh*...what a troublesome race."
CS_CH5_Main_1_003,"Hmm, so even Frey has a race she dislikes?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_004,"Well, it's not like I dislike them..."
CS_CH5_Main_1_005,"After all, Lua preaches; 'Condemn the sin but not the perpetrator'."
CS_CH5_Main_1_006,"This goes for all intellectual species, not just humans...but."
CS_CH5_Main_1_007,"Those Gnolls are just really hopeless.."
CS_CH5_Main_1_008,"Gnolls are naturally greedy and savage."
CS_CH5_Main_1_009,"During the Demon invasion, while all the other races were busy fighting against the Demons,"
CS_CH5_Main_1_010,"the Gnolls took advantage of the chaos and went about looting and plundering."
CS_CH5_Main_1_011,"Hmm... Roi. Despite your general stupidity, you seem to know a lot about the Gnolls!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_012,"Um...Actually...I used to have do business with the Gnolls often."
CS_CH5_Main_1_013,"Considering they fight between themselves all the time as well, there were a lot of assassination requests."
CS_CH5_Main_1_014,"Uh....sorry..."
CS_CH5_Main_1_015,"Don't be."
CS_CH5_Main_1_016,"It's me who should be thankful for all of you, putting up with me despite my dark past."
CS_CH5_Main_1_017,"...Uh, what's with this atmosphere?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_018,"Eh...um...well. Even though we know you aren't a cold person..."
CS_CH5_Main_1_019,"It's my first time seeing Roi... expressing his appreciation."
CS_CH5_Main_1_020,"...Is it?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_021,"Yeah, Roi. Be thankful about stuff more often!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_022,"You scared me for a second there!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_023,"Eh...sorry, I guess?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_024,"Haha, humans!!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_025,"Kyakyak! Cough up all your valuables or die!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_026,"*Sigh*....Frey was right... They really are hopeless."
CS_CH5_Main_1_027,"And the mood was just so good...what a waste."
CS_CH5_Main_2_001,"Hmm, it's odd that the Gnolls are this active around this area."
CS_CH5_Main_2_002,"They may be brutes, but considering their lack of intelligence..."
CS_CH5_Main_2_003,"What are the Dark Elves doing? This is their land, Arrovina... "
CS_CH5_Main_2_004,"Perhaps...there are some ongoing issues."
CS_CH5_Main_2_005,"Perhaps this will be a harder journey than expected."
CS_CH5_Main_2_006,"This is all because of Roi's acrophobia!"
CS_CH5_Main_2_007,"No, its because your flight magic is lacking."
CS_CH5_Main_2_008,"*Sigh*...and we had such a good mood going..."
CS_CH5_Main_2_009,"The Gnolls ruined everything!"
CS_CH5_Main_3_001,"Look..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_3_002,"A Dark Elf is surrounded by Gnolls!"
CS_CH5_Main_3_003,"We should save him, Kasel. "
CS_CH5_Main_4_001,"Excuse my belated apology."
CS_CH5_Main_4_002,"Shoot, we missed him."
CS_CH5_Main_4_003,"You, outsiders."
CS_CH5_Main_4_004,"Oh, yes, we are..."
CS_CH5_Main_4_005,"For helping a wanted criminal get away, we banish you from Arrovina."
CS_CH5_Main_4_006,"What? No way..!"
CS_CH5_Main_4_008,"Ugh.."
CS_CH5_Main_4_009,"Who's there? "
CS_CH5_Main_4_010,"Criminal, hah! What a load of crap. Shame on you! "
CS_CH5_Main_4_011,"Ugh!!!"
CS_CH5_Main_4_012,"Die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_4_013,"Hmph, you won't kill me with that kind of aim."
CS_CH5_Main_4_014,"I will remember your face."
CS_CH5_Main_4_015,"Tch, bastards."
CS_CH5_Main_4_016,"Outsiders. The Arrovina that was ruled by Dark Elves is done for."
CS_CH5_Main_4_017,"You better leave now."
CS_CH5_Main_5_001,"...What just happened?"
CS_CH5_Main_5_002,"The situation seems to complicated."
CS_CH5_Main_5_003,"We should go, fast."
CS_CH5_Sub_3_001,"The Dark Disease...!"
CS_CH5_Sub_3_002,"I see...so that guy was speaking the truth."
CS_CH5_Sub_3_003,"Yeah, the Dark Elves wouldn't just leave infected animals about in the open."
CS_CH5_Sub_3_004,"What has happened to Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_001,"Treants? This is not a forest, why would they even be here?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_002,"That is..a corrupted Treant."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_003,"It must have lost its way and wandered all over here."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_004,"Hmm...did it come here from Elidora?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_005,"No, this Treant must have been corrupted hundred years ago."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_006,"Aren't Treants intellectual life-forms?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_007,"I thought it was impossible for sapient beings to be corrupted..."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_008,"There are some Treants that start losing their intelligence after a certain age."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_009,"Those Treants usually go into a deep sleep, not unlike hibernation."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_010,"Angmund then inserted the soul of Demons inside those sleeping Treants."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_011,"Angmund, that bastard."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_012,"What a cruel thing to do!!"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_013,"We can only help them...by returning them to their slumber."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_014,"Goddess, Lua. Please embrace the spirits of the forest we return to you."
CS_CH5_Main_6_001,"Kyakyak! Look at yourselves! That's what you get for underestimating us!!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_002,"Now, die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_003,"Stop!!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_004,"Eh? Who are you?!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_005,"Mind your own business. Or do you want to become our food?!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_006,"They won't stop even when told to."
CS_CH5_Main_6_007,"Hmph! I'll make you regret even being born!!"
CS_CH5_Main_7_001,"Thank you, kind travellers."
CS_CH5_Main_7_002,"How did Dark Elves have trouble with mere Gnolls?"
CS_CH5_Main_7_003,"I've heard that the Demons are backing the Gnolls."
CS_CH5_Main_7_004,"Hahh...Gnolls again.."
CS_CH5_Main_7_005,"What has brought you all to in Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Main_7_006,"We are on our way to the Arrovina Desert."
CS_CH5_Main_7_007,"I see. As a show of gratitude, please let us show you the way."
CS_CH5_Main_8_001,"We must go South."
CS_CH5_Main_8_002,"Follow us. "
CS_CH5_Main_8_003,"Wait...Aegina is supposed to be westwards."
CS_CH5_Main_8_004,"The Gnolls have taken over the path, besides all the corrupted wildlife."
CS_CH5_Main_8_005,"The path south is far safer."
CS_CH5_Main_8_006,"Go on ahead. We will catch up soon."
CS_CH5_Main_8_007,"I don't know if we should follow them at all."
CS_CH5_Main_8_008,"Even if the Gnolls are backed by the Demons, it doesn't make sense for them to be as active as they are."
CS_CH5_Main_8_009,"Also....the case with that 'criminal'...everything is just so fishy."
CS_CH5_Main_8_010,"It also doesn't make sense that the Dark Elf from before tried to banish us from Arrovina off the bat."
CS_CH5_Main_8_011,"The west is close to the forest, however. It is probably true that it is dangerous."
CS_CH5_Main_8_012,"If both ways are risky, it is better to follow the Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_8_013,"We have a better chance in open areas."
CS_CH5_Main_8_014,"Alright. Let's do that."
CS_CH5_Main_8_015,"Everyone, just be on your guard."
CS_CH5_Main_9_001,"Wait...this feeling..."
CS_CH5_Main_9_002,"Cleo.. Can you feel it, too?"
CS_CH5_Main_9_003,"Yeah, its the same feeling that I had in Ellidora.."
CS_CH5_Main_9_004,"It's a magical power just like the Nucleus of Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_9_005,"Dark Elves, how many of those things are in Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Main_9_006,"The power is similar to that of the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_9_007,"Tch, you found out."
CS_CH5_Main_9_008,"So you show your true colors."
CS_CH5_Main_9_009,"I have no clue what you came here for, but if you know about these wards...you must die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_10_001,"Hmph, you fight well."
CS_CH5_Main_10_002,"I apologize for telling you to leave Arrovina. I underestimated you."
CS_CH5_Main_10_003,"Can you tell us what has happened?"
CS_CH5_Main_10_004,"Why are the Dark Elves utilizing the power of Darkness?"
CS_CH5_Main_10_005,"The Ward you just destroyed was built by the order of the new Queen, El-Rosed. "
CS_CH5_Main_10_006,"A Queen?"
CS_CH5_Main_10_007,"The Royalty Palace has gone mad. It's totally out of control. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_001,"A Queen...? That's kind of confusing."
CS_CH5_Main_11_002,"Communication with the outer world was cut ever since the Queen ascended to the throne."
CS_CH5_Main_11_003,"Where is King Timorel..?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_004,"Hmph, that coward must have run away a long time ago."
CS_CH5_Main_11_005,"He was too young when he became king, and he was always terrified of the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_11_006,"When the rumors about the Demons reappearing started circulating, he went mad."
CS_CH5_Main_11_007,"He sacrificed many of his people to the Demons just to keep himself safe."
CS_CH5_Main_11_008,"That's crazy!"
CS_CH5_Main_11_009,"How did that happen?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_010,"Even as he sacrificed his people, another one claiming to be of royal blood appeared."
CS_CH5_Main_11_011,"Her name was El-Rosed. King Temorel passed on the crown to her immediately, and then fled."
CS_CH5_Main_11_012,"However, nothing changed."
CS_CH5_Main_11_013,"She went on to install strange wards all around Arrovina, controlling those idiots."
CS_CH5_Main_11_014,"It doesn't quite look like they are being controlled."
CS_CH5_Main_11_015,"I mean, when this happened in Elidora, they were killing each other..."
CS_CH5_Main_11_016,"Perhaps its more alike the trap we've seen in Galluah..."
CS_CH5_Main_11_017,"Sieg looked fine on the outside, remember?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_018,"The Queen...may not be true royalty."
CS_CH5_Main_11_019,"At any rate, the wards seem to make the Dark Elves blindly loyal to their queen."
CS_CH5_Main_11_020,"Do the Elves of Arrovina know that King Temorel has sacrificed his people to the Demons?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_021,"Only the soldiers involved would know."
CS_CH5_Main_11_022,"Then how do you know? "
CS_CH5_Main_11_023,"After there were Demon sightings reported, I was dispatched to the Aegina Desert."
CS_CH5_Main_11_024,"I was taken prisoner, but a woman named 'Maria' told me about all this."
CS_CH5_Main_11_025,"Maria..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_11_026,"Do you know her?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_027,"An ill-fated relationship, if I ever saw one."
CS_CH5_Main_11_028,"Where is that witch?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_029,"She saved my life. If you have a bone to pick with her, then I don't see why I should tell you."
CS_CH5_Main_11_030,"Although, if you help me...I'll at least consider the notion."
CS_CH5_Main_11_031,"What is it that you want?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_032,"Well, nothing much. You just have to fight the Dark Elves with me. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_033,"Also, don't ever think of going north. It's too dangerous. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_034,"Is it because of the Gnolls and the corrupted wildlife?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_035,"Did those cowards make up those excuses?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_036,"The Queen is hiding herself behind her army."
CS_CH5_Main_11_037,"That's another reason nobody outside of Arrovina knows much about this issue."
CS_CH5_Main_11_038,"Anyway, the reason I said it's dangerous up north is because of Black Thorn Fortress. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_039,"The Queen must have already heard the news about you,"
CS_CH5_Main_11_040,"and the soldiers around the fortress will try to stop you."
CS_CH5_Main_12_001,"Fufufu, so many idiots, just asking to be killed."
CS_CH5_Main_12_002,"There is no need to kill them. We'll merely be making our way through them."
CS_CH5_Main_12_003,"Hmm, are you saying you can win without needing to kill anyone?"
CS_CH5_Main_12_004,"Lets try to keep the number of casualties to the minimum."
CS_CH5_Main_12_005,"Or, our Priest will..."
CS_CH5_Main_12_006,"Hah, I see. Minimal casualties, you say..."
CS_CH5_Main_13_001,"Die, filth!!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_002,"Kugh..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_003,"You swine, you dare sell out your own race just because of an idiot's royal decree?!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_004,"Even death is too good for you!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_005,"Stop, Dimael!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_006,"You're going too far against people who have already lost any means to fight!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_007,"Hah. I'm just keeping casualties to a minimum, right?"
CS_CH5_Main_13_008,"But you're finishing them off when you don't need to!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_009,"If that's how you are going to do things, leave us. Or do you want to fight us this time?"
CS_CH5_Main_13_010,"Then you won't hear anything about Maria. "
CS_CH5_Main_13_011,"We don't need to."
CS_CH5_Main_13_012,"If we let these elves live, they'll just report everything to the Queen, and they'll be back with bigger reinforcements."
CS_CH5_Main_13_013,"Don't say 'We'. "
CS_CH5_Main_13_014,"We don't want to be involved with a cruel person like you."
CS_CH5_Main_13_015,"And I tried to warn you, but you cut me off."
CS_CH5_Main_13_016,"Our Priest is quite scary, you know."
CS_CH5_Main_13_017,"I don't understand you. Why do you leave risks as such behind?"
CS_CH5_Main_13_018,"It is me who can't understand you."
CS_CH5_Main_13_019,"Why are you so eager to kill your own kind?!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_020,"We'll talk about this later. "
CS_CH5_Main_13_021,"The reinforcements are here."
CS_CH5_Main_14_001,"As things have settled down a bit, I think it's time for a little talk, Dimael."
CS_CH5_Main_14_002,"Hmph, and you were all so eager to leave me just a while ago."
CS_CH5_Main_14_003,"Well, you probably have your reasons."
CS_CH5_Main_14_004,"Like perhaps someone close to you was sacrificed to the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_14_005,"...I guess I was right."
CS_CH5_Main_14_006,"I thought you said people with no ties were the only ones selected as sacrifices?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_007,"My records say I was killed in Aegina."
CS_CH5_Main_14_008,"So Epigael... my sister and only family was..."
CS_CH5_Main_14_009,"So your sister was sacrificed to the Demons..."
CS_CH5_Main_14_010,"Yes. At first, I didn't understand what this 'sacrifice' meant."
CS_CH5_Main_14_011,"I thought I could find her. Get her back."
CS_CH5_Main_14_012,"But...what the Demons wanted was to create Undead. Sacrifices...meant dead bodies."
CS_CH5_Main_14_013,"Undead..."
CS_CH5_Main_14_014,"Malduk, that bastard..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_14_015,"I see...sorry for being so harsh with you."
CS_CH5_Main_14_016,"But Dimael, hatred will only ruin you."
CS_CH5_Main_14_017,"Hah! What's left to be ruined? I have nothing left."
CS_CH5_Main_14_018,"100 years ago, I lost my parents to the Demons. Now, my only sister was taken by my people."
CS_CH5_Main_14_019,"Every night, I can't even sleep because I fear seeing Epigael's undead form in my dreams."
CS_CH5_Main_14_020,"Revenge...is all I have left."
CS_CH5_Main_14_021,"So, how will you avenge yourself? Are you just killing every Dark Elf you see?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_022,"Hah, no."
CS_CH5_Main_14_023,"I will kill all soldiers that blindly follow the orders of the Crown. Those swine deserve to die."
CS_CH5_Main_14_024,"Did you feel any better killing them?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_025,"No. It's not enough, just slaughering worthless swine."
CS_CH5_Main_14_026,"My final goal is to destroy the Royal Crown. I thought you all could help me with that."
CS_CH5_Main_14_027,"We can't help you with that."
CS_CH5_Main_14_028,"If your goal was to save your people from the Darkness, we would give it our all."
CS_CH5_Main_14_029,"However, we cannot interfere with your country and its politics."
CS_CH5_Main_14_030,"I already told you."
CS_CH5_Main_14_031,"The Queen may not be of true royalty."
CS_CH5_Main_14_032,"That coward, Temorel, was probably tricked by her."
CS_CH5_Main_14_033,"So are you saying El-Rosed is possibly a Demon?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_034,"Well...we'll need to meet the Queen if we want to know about that,"
CS_CH5_Main_14_035,"You don't have a choice anyway. If you know about those Wards, there is no way she'll let you be."
CS_CH5_Main_15_001,"Hah, serves them right."
CS_CH5_Main_15_002,"That's what happens when you get corrupted and fool around."
CS_CH5_Main_15_003,"The Dark Elves from before said the Gnolls were allied with the Demons..."
CS_CH5_Main_15_004,"We can't trust them word for word."
CS_CH5_Main_15_005,"Dimael. Do you know anything about the Gnolls joining forces with the Demons?"
CS_CH5_Main_15_006,"That's news to me."
CS_CH5_Main_15_007,"I think...we should... talk with the Gnolls."
CS_CH5_Main_15_008,"Frey, I think the word you're searching for is 'interrogate' not 'talk'."
CS_CH5_Main_16_001,"If you answer us truthfully, we'll let you live."
CS_CH5_Main_16_002,"Please, please, good Master. I will speak nothing but the truth, don't hurt me."
CS_CH5_Main_16_003,"How did you Gnolls get powerful enough to rout the Dark Elves and take over?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_004,"Ah, ah, yes. That. A messenger of the Dark Lord came and gave us courage."
CS_CH5_Main_16_005,"A messenger..?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_006,"Don't lie, the Demon Lord hasn't even resurrected."
CS_CH5_Main_16_007,"Ah, ah...Then we probably misunderstood. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_008,"It may have not been the Demon Lord, but anyway it was still a Demon that encouraged us, yes!"
CS_CH5_Main_16_009,"What did the Demon say?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_010,"The Demon said the Dark Elves were weaker and that we could beat them in numbers."
CS_CH5_Main_16_011,"And when we went and fought, the Dark Elves weren't being sneaky anymore."
CS_CH5_Main_16_012,"Sneaky?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_013,"*Sigh*... The Dark-Elves were probably just being strategic."
CS_CH5_Main_16_014,"The Gnolls probably consider anything beyond frontal combat sneaky and underhanded."
CS_CH5_Main_16_015,"Anyway, we were thinking of conquering Arrovina by driving out the Dark Elves. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_016,"What did the Demon look like?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_017,"Ah, I haven't ever seen the Demon myself, I swear."
CS_CH5_Main_16_018,"I hope you aren't lying..."
CS_CH5_Main_16_019,"Please, good Master. I wouldn't lie to you. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_020,"Well, that seems to be it."
CS_CH5_Main_16_021,"Go. We won't hurt you."
CS_CH5_Main_16_022,"Don't ever cross paths with us again."
CS_CH5_Main_16_023,"Please, good Master. I wouldn't ever dare. It's just that..."
CS_CH5_Main_16_024,"the other Gnolls will probably still try to attack you..."
CS_CH5_Main_16_025,"I hope you understand that's not my fault!"
CS_CH5_Main_16_026,"Understood."
CS_CH5_Main_16_027,"Thank you for telling us the truth."
CS_CH5_Main_16_028,"Let's never meet again. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_029,"Yes, yes. I'll stay away, good Masters."
CS_CH5_Main_16_030,"Th..Then... Bye.."
CS_CH5_Main_16_031,"Take care."
CS_CH5_Main_17_001,"Typical Gnolls, weak to the strong and strong to the weak."
CS_CH5_Main_17_002,"I guess the Gnolls did side with the Demons, but it seems they haven't been given any powers."
CS_CH5_Main_17_003,"This is all so ridiculous."
CS_CH5_Main_17_004,"I can't stop myself from laughing..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_005,"El-Rosed...if she was trying to control people, she should learn how to do it right..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_006,"Dark-Elves... being pressured by simple, idiotic Gnolls..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_007,"Kkkk...Hahahaahaah!! Ugh, my sides..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_008,"Dimael..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_009,"I don't get it."
CS_CH5_Main_17_010,"The Queen, El-Rosed, who we don't yet know if she is a Demon or not, is using the power of darkness..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_011,"And the Gnolls are allied to the Demons.."
CS_CH5_Main_17_012,"But the Gnolls are attacking the Dark Elves...?"
CS_CH5_Main_17_013,"I wonder if the Demon Army is having a falling out."
CS_CH5_Main_17_014,"After all, Maria said she didn't like Malduk back In Ogria..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_015,"Maybe its like how it was in Ogria?"
CS_CH5_Main_17_016,"Malduk trying to control King Temorel... while Maria controls the Gnolls..."
CS_CH5_Main_17_017,"Hmm.. Dimael. Did Maria ask you anything personal?"
CS_CH5_Main_17_018,"Before she told me about what King Temorel had done,"
CS_CH5_Main_17_019,"she did ask me about my family."
CS_CH5_Main_17_020,"I see. It's highly likely then that Malduk is allied with El-Rosed."
CS_CH5_Main_17_021,"In the meanwhile, Maria is trying to interfere with that."
CS_CH5_Main_17_022,"Forget about the Gnolls...but Dimael, you are also being manipulated by Maria."
CS_CH5_Main_17_023,"It doesn't matter."
CS_CH5_Main_17_024,"All I want is my revenge."
CS_CH5_Main_18_001,"Hmm...Frey. "
CS_CH5_Main_18_002,"Yes?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_003,"You remember I analyzed the fragments of the Nucleus of Darkness, right?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_004,"I think I could neutralize the Wards after a quick analysis of them."
CS_CH5_Main_18_005,"Oh, Cleo. That would be wonderful!"
CS_CH5_Main_18_006,"Hmph, worthless. Don't bother."
CS_CH5_Main_18_007,"Those wards may be the only reason we're able to deal with the Dark Elves so easily."
CS_CH5_Main_18_008,"Neutralizing the Queen's control may make it harder to fight them. "
CS_CH5_Main_18_009,"Are you stupid? You said the Queen could be a Demon."
CS_CH5_Main_18_010,"In that case, wouldn't it be easier for us to wake everyone up and have them fight with us?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_011,"No, they are all just targets of my revenge. I have no intention of working with them."
CS_CH5_Main_18_012,"Dimael..."
CS_CH5_Main_18_013,"Have you ever faced your inner darkness in a dark place?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_014,"What are you talking about?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_015,"*Sigh*...so stubborn even without the help of that trap..."
CS_CH5_Main_18_016,"Dimael...he has been blinded by rage."
CS_CH5_Main_18_017,"All we can do is hope that Lua will bless his heart with the light of mercy..."
CS_CH5_Main_18_018,"Hah. Do you really think I would even accept such light."
CS_CH5_Main_18_019,"I have nothing left but revenge!! All I want is to kill those bastards!!"
CS_CH5_Main_18_020,"*Sigh*...it seems I've failed."
CS_CH5_Main_18_021,"I think I only fanned the flames of his hate..."
CS_CH5_Main_18_022,"Well.. Can't be helped. Let's just do what we can."
CS_CH5_Main_18_023,"First, let's break the Ward and gather the pieces."
CS_CH5_Main_19_001,"The Gnolls have passed the checkpoint. What were you all doing!?"
CS_CH5_Main_19_002,"I am sorry...We could not stop them, there were too many. "
CS_CH5_Main_19_003,"This must be the end for our race..."
CS_CH5_Main_19_004,"This is what we get for selling out our friends and families to the Demons..."
CS_CH5_Main_19_005,"Bascos.. That topic..."
CS_CH5_Main_19_006,"Do you really think that matters at this point?!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_007,"King Temorel is missing and there's nothing we can do about the attacking Gnolls."
CS_CH5_Main_19_008,"There is no way I can hold my head up high in front of the gravestones of our predecessors."
CS_CH5_Main_19_009,"Normally, you wouldn't be able to do that ever since you made a pact with the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_19_010,"You are..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_011,"Dimael, returning from Aegina."
CS_CH5_Main_19_012,"The only family of Epigael, whom you doomed to the Demons!!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_013,"Epigael..."
CS_CH5_Main_19_014,"Sorry but I don't remember that name."
CS_CH5_Main_19_015,"There are too many we sacrificed...to remember every single person."
CS_CH5_Main_19_016,"Hmph, then die."
CS_CH5_Main_19_017,"Engrave her name upon your heart as you do so!!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_018,"Sorry, but I can't die yet, Dimael. Even as the end of our race draws near, "
CS_CH5_Main_19_019,"I will save my Queen.. El-Rosed!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_001,"So..this is the end..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_002,"My Queen... I have to protect you....till the end.."
CS_CH5_Main_20_003,"Quit spewing the name of some Queen whose origins aren't know."
CS_CH5_Main_20_004,"I need you to remember Epigael's name as you die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_005,"I would much like to...sorry...."
CS_CH5_Main_20_006,"but I can only think of her Majesty's sad face..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_007,"Dammit, you've all been brainwashed!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_008,"The Queen is using the power of Darkness...she may even be a Demon..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_009,"and she brainwashed you all into blinded loyalty."
CS_CH5_Main_20_010,"She is not a Demon.."
CS_CH5_Main_20_011,"My Queen....is.....a...Dark-Elf...."
CS_CH5_Main_20_012,"Give it some thought. The royal bloodline, supposed to have died out...suddenly reappearing."
CS_CH5_Main_20_013,"Does that even make sense?!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_014,"Even if she is not of royal blood... It doesn't matter..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_015,"I can't imagine not living for her...trying to think otherwise makes my heart ache..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_016,"I wanted to..protect her..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_017,"And that is what is called brainwashing!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_018,"El-Rosed... My Queen...I couldn't keep you safe...I'm sorry..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_019,"Cmon, Bascos..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_020,"Get up. Wake up!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_021,"Stop searching for the fake queen,"
CS_CH5_Main_20_022,"get on your knees before me, and die as you apologize to Epigael!!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_023,"May Lua's blessing..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_024,"Shut up, Priest!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_025,"Don't pray for the dog who couldn't realise what reality was even beyond death!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_026,"Are you taking your frustration out on Frey?!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_027,"I'm fine, Cleo.. "
CS_CH5_Main_20_028,"It's all my fault..that I didn't understand Dimael's feelings..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_029,"Goddamnit, what an annoying woman."
CS_CH5_Main_20_030,"What!!?"
CS_CH5_Main_20_031,"Cleo..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_032,"...You have to thank Frey. If it wasn't for her, I'd have burned you to a crisp!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_033,"Yeah, thanks, Frey."
CS_CH5_Main_20_034,"I would have been burnt to death if it hadn't been for you...As if."
CS_CH5_Main_20_035,"I need to live....for now."
CS_CH5_Main_20_036,"Until I kill El-Rosed, who may as well be the last of the Royal Crown."
CS_CH5_Main_20_037,"And then, I will find Temorel....and...!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_038,"Lua my goddess, please save the poor souls..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_039,"Allow your light of salvation to touch those who died without returning to their natural state of mind..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_040,"and Dimael, whose hatred and thirst for revenge has blinded him."
CS_CH5_Main_21_001,"Geh!! You people are!!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_002,"Kyakyakya! New meat!! I was tired of eating only Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_21_003,"You idiot! The people are very very powerful!!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_004,"Please, please, forgive us. I didn't know you would come this way..."
CS_CH5_Main_21_005,"We will leave! Right now!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_006,"No, you don't have to. We need your help, and it will be to your advantage as well."
CS_CH5_Main_21_007,"Do you see that Ward?"
CS_CH5_Main_21_008,"That makes the Dark Elves stronger. Break it and bring the pieces to us."
CS_CH5_Main_21_009,"Ah, yes, yes we will!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_010,"I will break them all and bring a whole bunch of them!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_011,"Roi! You can't take advantage of them like that!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_012,"Oops, I'm sorry. .."
CS_CH5_Main_21_013,"But...it's too late. "
CS_CH5_Main_22_001,"Hmm.. This Ward seems to be of higher quality magic compared to the Nucleus of Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_22_002,"Really?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_003,"Isn't it easier for the controller to just completely take over minds like back in Ellidora?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_004,"Complete control uses far more mana and is easier to reverse."
CS_CH5_Main_22_005,"As you know, Lorraine freed the Dryads from that in Ellidora."
CS_CH5_Main_22_006,"In this case, however...even Lorraine will have trouble breaking the spell."
CS_CH5_Main_22_007,"And why is that? "
CS_CH5_Main_22_008,"The Nucleus of the Darkness takes over one's spirit, but this Ward controls their emotions."
CS_CH5_Main_22_009,"In Ellidora, the corrupted people lost their minds completely,"
CS_CH5_Main_22_010,"but this is different."
CS_CH5_Main_22_011,"They are sane, but their controlled emotions force them into swearing fealty to their queen."
CS_CH5_Main_22_012,"So its easy to return people to sanity, but emotions are harder to sway..."
CS_CH5_Main_22_013,"Yes. Kasel. "
CS_CH5_Main_22_014,"So the cases I got emotional..."
CS_CH5_Main_22_015,"were the times that the Holy Sword started emitting darkness...are these related?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_016,"Dark emotions are hard to turn around."
CS_CH5_Main_22_017,"The pain only gets harder to deal with once their conscience steps in."
CS_CH5_Main_22_018,"Failing to deal with that pain will paralyze reasonable thought."
CS_CH5_Main_22_019,"Sieg... and Bascos...are cases of this, I think..."
CS_CH5_Main_22_020,"...I see."
CS_CH5_Main_22_021,"Himmullis and Balalaika were sane back in Ellidora,"
CS_CH5_Main_22_022,"so they weren't mind controlled at any rate."
CS_CH5_Main_22_023,"In the case of the Ward, though, there needs to be some kind of medium."
CS_CH5_Main_22_024,"A medium?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_025,"In the case of Sieg, his medium, or rather his darkest emotions, could be attributed to his inferiority complex."
CS_CH5_Main_22_026,"When we were trapped in Galluah, we were shown our dark sides..."
CS_CH5_Main_22_027,"Yes, that's true."
CS_CH5_Main_22_028,"In this case, however, we don't know what the Dark Elves are shackled with."
CS_CH5_Main_22_029,"This isn't based on magic, so it's beyond my specialty."
CS_CH5_Main_22_030,"Anyway, it means we need to meet the Queen,"
CS_CH5_Main_22_031,"and figure out what exactly became the medium for controlling the Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_22_032,"*Sigh*...The problem is, I don't think she'll give us a proper answer."
CS_CH5_Main_22_033,"We can't give up!"
CS_CH5_Main_22_034,"We should give it a try, and talk to the Queen first!"
CS_CH5_Main_22_035,"I find it most terrifying when Frey says we need to talk with the enemy."
CS_CH5_Main_23_001,"Are you the people that destroyed the Wards?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_002,"...Epigael..?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_003,"Wh..What?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_004,"Is..this a dream...?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_005,"Ah.. My brother.. You are alive..! "
CS_CH5_Main_23_006,"Is this real...? Is it really you, Epigael."
CS_CH5_Main_23_007,"My brother. I gave up my old name. My name now is El-Rosed."
CS_CH5_Main_23_009,"What happened to you... You became queen..?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_010,"First, come with me. I will tell you everything later."
CS_CH5_Main_23_011,"Let's get our revenge. Let's kill off every Dark Elf aside from ourselves..."
CS_CH5_Main_23_012,"What...are you talking about..?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_013,"It's all good now.... I met you, and that's all I needed. "
CS_CH5_Main_23_014,"I don't want you to stain your own hands with revenge. Let's leave this place...together."
CS_CH5_Main_23_016,"We should punish them for what they have done to us."
CS_CH5_Main_23_017,"Epigael.. I came all the way here to avenge your death."
CS_CH5_Main_23_018,"It wasn't as easy. There were many times when I just wanted to die."
CS_CH5_Main_23_019,"If you won't come with me, you must leave Arrovina."
CS_CH5_Main_23_020,"Otherwise, you will die too."
CS_CH5_Main_23_021,"Because all Dark Elves will die. "
CS_CH5_Main_23_022,"Epigael!!"
CS_CH5_Main_24_001,"He's...gone."
CS_CH5_Main_24_002,"....I don't even."
CS_CH5_Main_24_003,"Kekeh, good Masters."
CS_CH5_Main_24_004,"Eh? What is it?"
CS_CH5_Main_24_005,"You are all our heroes."
CS_CH5_Main_24_006,"Becoming heroes for Gnolls isnt quite pleasing. "
CS_CH5_Main_24_007,"So...we would like to repay you..."
CS_CH5_Main_24_008,"But since we don't have anything to give, we will introduce you to someone who can!"
CS_CH5_Main_24_009,"The Demons..?"
CS_CH5_Main_24_010,"So strong, and so smart, even!"
CS_CH5_Main_24_011,"Demons...this could be dangerous."
CS_CH5_Main_24_012,"Well, it may be better to give it a try."
CS_CH5_Main_24_013,"It could still be a trap, so be wary."
CS_CH5_Main_24_014,"Trap? No, no, nonono. No way, good Masters."
CS_CH5_Main_24_015,"I would never lie to you."
CS_CH5_Main_24_016,"She will be here soon, kekeke."
CS_CH5_Main_25_001,"You are..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_25_002,"Stupid Gnolls, ugh."
CS_CH5_Main_25_003,"Well, it doesn't matter."
CS_CH5_Main_25_004,"Let's see how much stronger you've become!"
CS_CH5_Main_26_001,"That wasn't bad. I enjoyed myself quite a bit."
CS_CH5_Main_26_002,"Were you using Dimael and Epigael??"
CS_CH5_Main_26_003,"Epigael? Ah, right. Dimael's sister."
CS_CH5_Main_26_004,"I see you've figured out quite a bit."
CS_CH5_Main_26_005,"What are you scheming, Morrah!"
CS_CH5_Main_26_006,"I see...those two have met."
CS_CH5_Main_26_007,"If you're that curious, we wouldn't mind a little session of information trading."
CS_CH5_Main_26_008,"Hmph, no need. It's not my problem."
CS_CH5_Main_26_009,"I'm done here."
CS_CH5_Main_27_001,"Do you think Morrah's goal was having those two meet?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_002,"Hm...I don't know what she would gain from that."
CS_CH5_Main_27_003,"I don't know either, but if the Demons know of their relationship and are trying to use that,"
CS_CH5_Main_27_004,"that wouldn't mean anything good for us. We should be careful."
CS_CH5_Main_27_005,"I think...we still need to meet and talk with them to understand the full picture."
CS_CH5_Main_27_006,"Cleo, are you ready?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_007,"Yeah. I was too startled a bit ago, but next time we meet, I'll be ready."
CS_CH5_Main_27_008,"What are you trying to do? "
CS_CH5_Main_27_009,"We'll try and save El-Rosed from the Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_27_010,"Wait, is that possible? "
CS_CH5_Main_27_011,"Well there are two problems yet to be solved..."
CS_CH5_Main_27_012,"One, we still don't know what the medium is."
CS_CH5_Main_27_013,"Isn't it revenge?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_014,"Well, for El-Rosed, yes. However, we're trying to reverse the power of the Wards."
CS_CH5_Main_27_015,"So we need to know the medium used for the Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_27_016,"Hmm... I see."
CS_CH5_Main_27_017,"What is the other?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_018,"We can't guarantee her life."
CS_CH5_Main_27_019,"Yes...even in Ellidora,"
CS_CH5_Main_27_020,"we had to defeat the Dryads first for Lorrain to revert them back to their normal state."
CS_CH5_Main_27_021,"We don't know how strong El-Rosed is... but we may die if we underestimate her."
CS_CH5_Main_27_022,"Yes...so we can't guarantee anything."
CS_CH5_Main_27_023,"Even if we fight with all our power, we can't be sure about the safety of her, or even ourselves."
CS_CH5_Main_27_024,"Nothing to worry about, Frey."
CS_CH5_Main_27_025,"We have the holy sword!"
CS_CH5_Main_27_026,"Sure..but I hope we don’t come to a situation where we need it."
CS_CH5_Main_27_027,"I'm not too sure what will happen...if the power breaks out while I have yet to control it..."
CS_CH5_Main_27_028,"Especially considering we did travel with Dimael for a bit..."
CS_CH5_Main_27_029,"I would not want to kill his sister in front of him."
CS_CH5_Main_27_030,"Yeah..he may be a rude one, but that's too cruel."
CS_CH5_Main_27_031,"Cleo, if you can defeat El-Rosed's darkness,"
CS_CH5_Main_27_032,"can you stop the Darkness flowing into me from the Holy Sword as well?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_033,"Eh, what are you saying?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_034,"That's Frey's role! She'll be sad if you rely on me for that."
CS_CH5_Main_27_035,"Are you making excuses up because you can't?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_036,"Ugh, you idiot. The Holy Sword can't be analyzed by even the oldest of Druids!"
CS_CH5_Main_27_037,"You don't even know a bit about magic, and you accuse me of making excuses??"
CS_CH5_Main_27_038,"Haha, sorry. Well, it's just impressive that you found a way to turn El-Rosed back to normal."
CS_CH5_Main_27_039,"I am truly sorry, grand archmage."
CS_CH5_Main_27_040,"....I think I like it better when you fool around. Ew..."
CS_CH5_Main_27_041,"Hahah.. You two really are a good match."
CS_CH5_Main_27_042,"NO!!!!!!!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_001,"El Rosed..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_002,"You are... the people who were with my brother..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_003,"Did my brother leave?"
CS_CH5_Main_28_004,"We thought he was with you..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_005,"We were here together... He left me at the end. "
CS_CH5_Main_28_006,"This is all because of the Dark Elves...the ones who sacrificed me to the Demons..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_007,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry... my Queen."
CS_CH5_Main_28_008,"Cmon, all of you are just being brainwashed! She is trying to exterminate every single Dark Elf!!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_009,"My... my queen. We did realize things aren't as usual right now... Do they speak the truth? "
CS_CH5_Main_28_010,"...What would you say if they are?"
CS_CH5_Main_28_011,"No...you can't... My Queen.."
CS_CH5_Main_28_012,"If you believe so...kill me."
CS_CH5_Main_28_013,"I'm... sorry. My Queen... for our race, forgive me for having to kill you."
CS_CH5_Main_28_014,"Kugh... what is this pain deep in my heart.. I can't dare kill her.."
CS_CH5_Main_28_015,"Please..I'd rather die myself...!!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_016,"All the Dark Elves will die soon anyway. "
CS_CH5_Main_28_017,"Get rid of them. They've learned too much."
CS_CH5_Main_28_018,"You can all die if you need to. Build a mountain of dead bodies for my sake, and stop them."
CS_CH5_Main_28_019,"On your honor..!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_020,"Wake up! You know we have come to save you!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_021,"But I...even so..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_022,"we can't but help protect our Queen."
CS_CH5_Main_28_023,"We can't resist it. "
CS_CH5_Main_28_024,"Her sad face breaks our hearts..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_025,"We will keep her safe no matter what, our Queen... El-Rosed!"
CS_CH5_Main_29_001,"Please...spare the life of our Queen..Please..!"
CS_CH5_Main_29_002,"Why...why are you trying so hard, for a Queen that is trying to kill you all?"
CS_CH5_Main_29_003,"I...know that she is not of royalty..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_004,"I knew from the beginning....when she returned..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_005,"She was the one I had lead...to the demons..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_006,"I couldn't resist her from the beginning..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_007,"Guilt...deep, dark guilt washed all over me..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_008,"Then, I knew. Every one of our race, even those who have never seen her before, were all like me."
CS_CH5_Main_29_009,"Guilt was rooted deep in our hearts..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_010,"So.. please leave our poor Queen alone..let her go. "
CS_CH5_Main_29_011,"Guit...Remorse..."
CS_CH5_Main_29_012,"Cleo."
CS_CH5_Main_29_013,"Yes. The medium...was guilt."
CS_CH5_Main_29_014,"Everyone remembered the Dark Elves that had been killed by their own hands when they saw El-Rosed."
CS_CH5_Main_29_015,"That’s why they couldn't help but be loyal to her."
CS_CH5_Main_29_016,"It's exactly what that had controlled them."
CS_CH5_Main_29_017,"Now...we can save El-Rosed from the Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_29_018,"If she doesn't die, that is."
CS_CH5_Main_29_019,"Good  thing that Dimael isn't here."
CS_CH5_Main_30_001,"Worthless, all of you. They've made it this far..."
CS_CH5_Main_30_002,"Stop them, even if you all die!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_001,"Stop!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_002,"My brother, you have come back..!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_003,"You..you!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_004,"Hypocrites! You take pity on us for a second, and then try to harm Epigael!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_005,"We're just trying to save El-Rosed from the Darkness!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_006,"Free? Her? With your swords and blades?!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_007,"Uh...we have to defeat her first to..."
CS_CH5_Main_31_008,"Stop that, it's dangerous!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_009,"Epigael, come here."
CS_CH5_Main_31_010,"I can't agree with your goals, but I will definitely keep you safe from those who try to harm you!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_011,"Dimael...we didn't want you to show up..."
CS_CH5_Main_31_012,"Forgive us. We can't let the Demons have their way here!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_001,"Now!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_002,"Good. Come on, Frey!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_003,"Yes!!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_004,"I remember the faces of those who kidnapped me..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_005,"Guilty, apologetic expresssions..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_006,"fear and anger had clouded my eyes..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_007,"Now...I see."
CS_CH5_Main_32_008,"Why now.."
CS_CH5_Main_32_009,"Even when they had always looked at me that way..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_010,"Epigael..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_011,"Epigael, open your eyes."
CS_CH5_Main_32_012,"Epigael: B..brother.."
CS_CH5_Main_32_013,"Epigael: What have I..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_014,"Dimael: It's fine Epi... We had no other choice..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_015,"Epigael: Yes... but they were suffering, too..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_016,"Epigael: Not only the king Timorel.."
CS_CH5_Main_32_017,"Epigael: Everyone were afraid of another tragedy...one like 100 years ago..."
CS_CH5_Main_32_018,"Epigael: I...felt the same."
CS_CH5_Main_32_019,"Dimael: That doesn't mean their sins disappeared."
CS_CH5_Main_32_020,"Epigael: And neither...have mine."
CS_CH5_Main_32_021,"Dimael: Yes.. My sins, as well."
CS_CH5_Main_32_022,"Epigael: Do you think we can forgive ourselves? Would we be able to forgive each other?"
CS_CH5_Main_32_023,"Dimael: We should try, Epi. We all have to try..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_001,"I'm sorry I spoil the mood, but do you intend to beg the Dark Elves for their forgiveness."
CS_CH5_Main_33_002,"Yes, we are."
CS_CH5_Main_33_003,"I disagree."
CS_CH5_Main_33_004,"Too many were lost."
CS_CH5_Main_33_005,"When they figure out El-Rosed was not of royal blood, who knows what may happen."
CS_CH5_Main_33_006,"What happened to King Timorel?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_007,"I...killed him."
CS_CH5_Main_33_008,"Nobody of the Royal family is left, and Arrovina is a mess."
CS_CH5_Main_33_009,"Meanwhile, the Gnolls are massacring your race."
CS_CH5_Main_33_010,"It's all my fault...I stopped them from fighting properly,"
CS_CH5_Main_33_011,"and let the Gnolls take over Arrovina."
CS_CH5_Main_33_012,"Then are you aware of Maria or Morrah?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_013,"I have never heard of them before."
CS_CH5_Main_33_014,"Then who corrupted you with the darkness?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_015,"When I was kidnapped, I was taken to a Black Knight."
CS_CH5_Main_33_016,"A large, deep Darkness pierced my very being..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_017,"I passed out as the Darkness ravaged my soul,"
CS_CH5_Main_33_018,"and when I came to...I was already a slave to the Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_33_019,"A Black Knight...if he used the power of Darkness, it would be a Demon..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_020,"Actually..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_021,"He was neither Demon nor Human."
CS_CH5_Main_33_022,"He was ominous and frightening...but irresistable."
CS_CH5_Main_33_023,"...Some mixed breed of Human and Demon?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_024,"I've never heard of such beings."
CS_CH5_Main_33_025,"Did the Black Knight tell you to use Gnolls?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_026,"No, that was my idea."
CS_CH5_Main_33_027,"I thought if the current situation of Arrovina was known to the outside, it would bother 'His' plans..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_028,"so I thought this was the easiest way to get rid of my kind."
CS_CH5_Main_33_029,"So 'He' was the Black Knight..?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_030,"Yes."
CS_CH5_Main_33_031,"Hmm.. Then the 'He' Himmullis mentioned must also be the Black Knight."
CS_CH5_Main_33_032,"Is the 'He' Malduk spoke of also...?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_033,"Not sure. This 'He' thing is just a pronoun. We can't judge without context."
CS_CH5_Main_33_034,"Why was Morrah here, then?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_035,"Perhaps she is with the Black Knight. Or, she was trying to help with El-Rosed's plan."
CS_CH5_Main_33_036,"We can only make assumptions with what we have..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_037,"Were you headed to Aegina?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_038,"Yes. You said you were dispatched to Aegina before, Dimael?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_039,"I wouldn’t recommand the place. There is a reason I was almost killed."
CS_CH5_Main_33_040,"Aegina is overrun with Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_33_041,"Even more reason for us to go there."
CS_CH5_Main_33_042,"So...I guess your sword is Aea."
CS_CH5_Main_33_043,"How did you..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_044,"I will help you. I know Aegina better than most other people."
CS_CH5_Main_33_045,"However, give me some time...I want to spend some time with Epigael first."
CS_CH5_Main_33_046,"Hmph, don't bother. I don't care about you."
CS_CH5_Main_33_047,"I'm really sorry for being rude all this time. From now on, I will treat you properly as an archmage."
CS_CH5_Main_33_048,"Really..? Then..."
CS_CH5_Main_33_049,"Go ahead.."
CS_CH5_Main_33_050,"I will join you soon."
CS_CH5_Main_33_051,"What about Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_052,"As long as nobody reveals the truth,"
CS_CH5_Main_33_053,"I am the Queen of Dark-Elves, El-Rosed. "
CS_CH5_Main_33_054,"With this position...I will try to fix what I have done."
CS_CH5_Main_33_055,"That's the best solution for now."
CS_CH5_Main_33_056,"I pray for Lua's blessing to be with the Kingdom of the Dark Elves, Arrovina."
CS_CH6_Main_0_001,"Finally, the Aegina Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_0_002,"The Barbarian kingdom was located within the Windland Snow Mountains, right?"
CS_CH6_Main_0_003,"The mountains are straight up north, but blocked off by a gigantic cliff."
CS_CH6_Main_0_004,"The only way to get there is through the Dragia Volcano."
CS_CH6_Main_0_005,"*Sigh*...Seems we still have quite the journey ahead of us."
CS_CH6_Main_0_006,"The Dragia Volcano should be west of our location."
CS_CH6_Main_0_007,"Dimael said Aegina was overrun by the Demons..."
CS_CH6_Main_0_008,"Lets be careful."
CS_CH6_Main_1_001,"Well, about those Demons running wild in Aegina..."
CS_CH6_Main_1_002,"I don't see any."
CS_CH6_Main_1_003,"I wonder if it's because we've just entered the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_1_004,"Perhaps the Demon Army moved somewhere else?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_005,"It's been a while since Dimael returned to Arrovina, after all."
CS_CH6_Main_1_006,"Let's be careful, just in case."
CS_CH6_Main_1_007,"....On that note, I sense an odd presence looking this way..."
CS_CH6_Main_1_008,"Who's there!!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_009,"Hey! Don't turn around!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_010,"...A girl?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_011,"*Sigh*...and things were just getting good...Still!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_012,"Even his face is so handsome~!!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_013,"But, but, the rear view was...wait, stay still for a second."
CS_CH6_Main_1_014,"On top of that, so cool~! What a great catch."
CS_CH6_Main_1_015,"Treating people like objects is rude, you know."
CS_CH6_Main_1_016,"Sorry, sorry~ I've been working as a mercenary for so long,\nI just kinda go ahead and evaluate people."
CS_CH6_Main_1_017,"A mercenary? Who hired you to come all this way to the Desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_018,"Umm...right now, I don't have any contracts. Want to hire me?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_019,"I'll give you a discount!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_020,"No."
CS_CH6_Main_1_021,"Hmm...will you be able to refuse after seeing my skills? C'mon, lets go. I'll show you!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_022,"No."
CS_CH6_Main_1_023,"Hehe, then go on ahead first. I'll just...enjoy myself a bit more. Hehe..."
CS_CH6_Main_1_024,"Heh, Roi...looks like you better let her hang around you rather than...you know!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_025,"*Sigh*...another weirdo."
CS_CH6_Main_2_001,"Hmm, only scorpions and Muhrooms...well, it'll have to do."
CS_CH6_Main_2_002,"Now, behold the skills of Reina, the Lightning Flash!"
CS_CH6_Main_3_001,"Your name was Reina, right? Your skills are quite impressive."
CS_CH6_Main_3_002,"Hehe, thanks for the compliment."
CS_CH6_Main_3_003,"Still, if anything...I would like to be complimented by this handsome gentleman~"
CS_CH6_Main_3_004,"Got a name, mister?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_005,"You might have figured already, but we don't need any mercenaries."
CS_CH6_Main_3_006,"While I acknowledge your skills,\nI feel no need to give my name to a stranger, as we will part ways soon."
CS_CH6_Main_3_007,"His name is Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_3_008,"*Sigh*...Cleo..."
CS_CH6_Main_3_009,"Fufu, no way I'm letting a girl so interested in Roi just leave like this."
CS_CH6_Main_3_010,"Hehe, so will you hire me?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_011,"Nope!"
CS_CH6_Main_3_012,"Eh?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_013,"As Roi said, we don't really need any mercenaries."
CS_CH6_Main_3_014,"If you don't have anything to do, let's travel together for a while\nWe'll provide the necessary provisions."
CS_CH6_Main_3_015,"Hmm...well, it is quite boring to travel alone."
CS_CH6_Main_3_016,"Still, just joining like that goes against my pride as a mercenary."
CS_CH6_Main_3_017,"Well then, take Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_3_018,"Who gave you the right!?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_019,"Hmm...well then, what about this?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_020,"I originally went to Orvelia to get a contract, but there were no good jobs."
CS_CH6_Main_3_021,"So I came all this way to Aegina because I heard someone else was hiring mercenaries."
CS_CH6_Main_3_022,"So you've visited Orvelia."
CS_CH6_Main_3_023,"Eh? Who are you? Since when were you there?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_024,"Uh...I was here all the time..."
CS_CH6_Main_3_025,"Ah, ok. Hi then."
CS_CH6_Main_3_026,"So, where are you all going?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_027,"We're headed towards the Dragia Volcano to find a way into the Windland Mountains."
CS_CH6_Main_3_028,"Well, we seem to be headed in the same direction."
CS_CH6_Main_3_029,"After all, my employer-to-be is supposed to be located somewhere\naround the West of the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_4_001,"Eh? Goblins and gnolls, together?"
CS_CH6_Main_4_002,"In the Desert, too..."
CS_CH6_Main_4_003,"Ack! Humans! Cough up, now!"
CS_CH6_Main_4_004,"Wow. Seriously. Goblins, threatening me, the Lightning Flash?"
CS_CH6_Main_4_005,"I'll make you regret this."
CS_CH6_Main_4_006,"If you won't cough up, we'll make you!"
CS_CH6_Main_4_007,"Hah, try it! You dared threaten an archmage. My flames will punish you all!"
CS_CH6_Main_4_008,"...Wow, there is actually someone in this world on the same wavelength as Cleo..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_001,"Kekeke,  I'm so sorry, so sorry, noble Masters..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_002,"Yeah, that's how things should be."
CS_CH6_Main_5_003,"You guys don't live here in the Desert. Why are you all here?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_004,"Us, Pirates!"
CS_CH6_Main_5_005,"Pirates? In the desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_006,"Ach? Pirates cannot in Desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_007,"You idiot!! Pirates are supposed to sail the Sea!!"
CS_CH6_Main_5_008,"But you're all in the Desert right now."
CS_CH6_Main_5_009,"Please, please, good Masters...we...kind of have our own issues..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_010,"We will go to the Sea eventually."
CS_CH6_Main_5_011,"We just need some money to do so...but then, you know..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_012,"So you're robbing people in the Desert in order to get a boat and be pirates?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_013,"By the name of Lua, if you don't stop..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_014,"Aaah! Please, please forgive us, dear Masters."
CS_CH6_Main_5_015,"We'll stop robbing people and go back home..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_016,"Ach, leave now, before they change mind!!"
CS_CH6_Main_5_017,"I dunno about the goblin...but wouldn't it be dangerous for the gnoll to return home?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_018,"I believe in giving everyone a chance."
CS_CH6_Main_5_019,"Of course...as long as it doesn't put us in danger."
CS_CH6_Main_6_001,"C'mon, hand over everything you have! Or should I just eat you, eh?!"
CS_CH6_Main_6_002,"Captain tell us steal, not eat!!"
CS_CH6_Main_6_003,"Dammit, you dumb goblin! Don't you know anything about threatening people?!"
CS_CH6_Main_6_004,"More robbers..."
CS_CH6_Main_6_005,"Ah! Please, help!! "
CS_CH6_Main_6_006,"Hahaha, what good luck! We'll make a killing today."
CS_CH6_Main_6_007,"Nope, you're really unlucky."
CS_CH6_Main_6_008,"Bullying such a cutie in front of me is worthy of punishment!!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_001,"Keke! Run! You, Captain won't forgive!!!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_002,"At this point, I'm just curious who's in charge of all these goblins and gnolls."
CS_CH6_Main_7_003,"Are you ok, cutie?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_004,"Thank you for saving me."
CS_CH6_Main_7_005,"Wow, your smile is so~~ cute. What's your name?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_006,"Ah...it's Adin."
CS_CH6_Main_7_007,"Ew...I thought she was only interested in Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_7_008,"What a flirt."
CS_CH6_Main_7_009,"I see~ Adin, it's dangerous to travel alone in the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_7_010,"Come with big sis~ I'll keep you safe day and night!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_011,"While I dunno about day, I can't really say the same for night."
CS_CH6_Main_7_012,"Why are you alone in this dangerous area?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_013,"Wow, Roi~ Are you putting your guard up because I'm showing interest in Adin?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_014,"You wish."
CS_CH6_Main_7_015,"Cool as always~ Well, that is your charm point!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_016,"So, anyway...what's little cutie Adin doing alone in the Desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_017,"I'm searching for the hidden treasure of the Aegina Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_7_018,"Treasure? What kind of treasure? Is it some kind of magical device?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_019,"Um..no, just stuff like gold."
CS_CH6_Main_7_020,"Eeh..what a disappointment."
CS_CH6_Main_7_021,"Eh? Well, as travelers, don't you need a lot of gold?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_022,"Like, you need it for all sorts of things, especially related to equipment...\nand it's good to be rich."
CS_CH6_Main_7_023,"Um..yeah, that's true, but I don't want to waste time looking for some hidden treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_7_024,"I mean, there are many other ways to make money, right?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_025,"So, any clue where this treasure is?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_026,"No, I haven't figured out the exact location yet..."
CS_CH6_Main_7_027,"Is that so? Well then, why don't we gather intel together?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_028,"Eh? Is that ok?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_029,"I agree."
CS_CH6_Main_7_030,"That's some quick decision making there, Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_7_031,"Hmm...I wonder if Roi prefers Reina sticking around Adin?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_032,"Roi, does interest from a woman other than Cleo make you uncomfortable?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_033,"*Sigh*...Frey, stop trying to couple me with Cleo."
CS_CH6_Main_7_034,"I'm just a bodyguard doing his job."
CS_CH6_Main_7_035,"Yeah, Frey. Stop trying to pair me with Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_8_001,"Are you the naughty children that bullied my boys?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_002,"Eh? Is that child the so-called Captain of those gnolls and goblins?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_003,"It appears to be so."
CS_CH6_Main_8_004,"I won't forgive you for raising your hand against the Miruru Pirates!"
CS_CH6_Main_8_005,"Eh? You're Miruru?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_006,"Dammit, there go my plans."
CS_CH6_Main_8_007,"Have you heard of Miruru from somewhere before?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_008,"Nah, it's just that the person hiring mercenaries was named Miruru."
CS_CH6_Main_8_009,"To think it was a pirate. And a child at that, too..."
CS_CH6_Main_8_010,"What? How could you not know the great Pirate Empress, Miruru!"
CS_CH6_Main_8_011,"Pirate Empress...?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_012,"Oh, come to think of it, I've heard about this before.\nThe Pirate Empress of the Seas, Miruru."
CS_CH6_Main_8_013,"She disappeared at some point...but I never knew she was a kid."
CS_CH6_Main_8_014,"Hmph, disrespectful brats. I'll stuff you full with my special cannonballs!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_001,"Huh, you all fight quite well!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_002,"OK, I'll accept you all as underlings!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_003,"Hah, I wouldn't join a pirate crew loitering around in the Desert if it was the last thing I did."
CS_CH6_Main_9_004,"Well, if it was lead by a big, tough and cool man I could have at least considered it..."
CS_CH6_Main_9_005,"Ahh ahh, I can't hear you, you're all my underlings now! That's final!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_006,"No."
CS_CH6_Main_9_007,"Nngh, I'll keep stalking you till you say OK!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_008,"*Sigh*...No sight of the Demon forces, and just a bunch of weirdos everywhere.."
CS_CH6_Main_9_009,"Well, we can't stop her if she says she'll follow us..."
CS_CH6_Main_9_010,"OK, Miruru. You can follow us, but you must stop robbing people."
CS_CH6_Main_9_011,"If you rob anyone else, we will be enemies again."
CS_CH6_Main_9_012,"Ok, ok. Now then! Let's go, my minions!!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_013,"We aren't your minions!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_001,"Kekeke, to think mere gnolls and goblins are invading our territory.."
CS_CH6_Main_10_002,"Kyak... damn...but...Captain forgive you not!!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_003,"Ca...captain!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_004,"Grr, you lizards...how dare you bully my underlings!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_005,"I, the Great Pirate Empress Miruru, will not forgive you!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_006,"Kekekeke, Pirate?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_007,"Hey, hey, did you hear? Pirates! In the Desert!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_008,"And the brat is the boss of Goblins and Gnolls! Gahahaha!!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_009,"What...these idiots..."
CS_CH6_Main_10_010,"No need to cry, Miruru. Pirates and robbers are evil,"
CS_CH6_Main_10_011,"but leading a number of different races isn't easy."
CS_CH6_Main_10_012,"You have accomplished that difficult task."
CS_CH6_Main_10_013,"Re..really?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_014,"Why can't I bring myself to believe she's really the Pirate Empress Miruru..."
CS_CH6_Main_10_015,"Th..thank you, Frey. I won't cry anymore."
CS_CH6_Main_10_016,"I swear this curse affected my psyche as well...I keep acting so childish."
CS_CH6_Main_10_017,"A curse?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_018,"Well, I found a treasure that grants eternal youth..."
CS_CH6_Main_10_019,"But it was cursed, and I turned into a kiddie!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_020,"Ki..kiddie??"
CS_CH6_Main_10_021,"Hehe, Frey~ Since I was cursed, you're the firstie to acknowledge me~"
CS_CH6_Main_10_022,"Huggies?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_023,"I...no...Dammit! Hey! Your minions were bullied by those lizards!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_024,"You need to avenge them!!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_025,"Ah! Right, right. Damn lizards, I'll introduce your faces to my cannonballs!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_026,"Phew... successful diversion."
CS_CH6_Main_10_027,"I'm envious, Frey. Aren't you popular?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_028,"Um..well, I don't know about being popular,\nbut it's good that we were able to help Miruru."
CS_CH6_Main_11_001,"Damn lizards! Taste my cannonballs, and remember the wrath of the Miruru Pirates!!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_002,"Hahaha, you can't win against the Power of Darkness we obtained!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_003,"Power of...Darkness?"
CS_CH6_Main_11_004,"So even the lizardmen..."
CS_CH6_Main_11_005,"Do they have a catalyst as well?"
CS_CH6_Main_11_006,"Well, they look sane...so that's probably likely."
CS_CH6_Main_11_007,"Perhaps there is another way to use the Darkness, a way we haven't learned of yet."
CS_CH6_Main_11_008,"Get them, my minions!!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_009,"Uh...uh?! But I can't fight!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_010,"Don't worry, cutie~ You don't have to listen to that brat."
CS_CH6_Main_11_011,"Little Adin only needs to listen to big sis~ hehe."
CS_CH6_Main_11_012,"Just stick behind my back~"
CS_CH6_Main_11_013,"Ah, ok..."
CS_CH6_Main_12_001,"Ah! There's a treasure chest over there!!"
CS_CH6_Main_12_002,"Adin, it's dangerous to run off alone!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_001,"He...help."
CS_CH6_Main_13_002,"Adin!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_003,"You dare lay your hands on my little cutie..!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_004,"Kekeke, so you're the Miruru Pirates."
CS_CH6_Main_13_005,"Yep, we're the Miruru Pirates!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_006,"No we aren't!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_007,"Heh, since the boss is a little girl, I suppose this little boy is her mate."
CS_CH6_Main_13_008,"Hey, I said Miruru isn't our boss!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_009,"Also, what kind of logic leads to that conclusion?!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_010,"He has nothing to do with Miruru either so let him go!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_011,"Ahahaha, of course you'd be mad after we kidnapped your comrade."
CS_CH6_Main_13_012,"Ugh, do those lizards only mate when both sides are similar in size..."
CS_CH6_Main_13_013,"Well, time to go, mate of Miruru. I'm sure you'll make a pretty sum as a slave."
CS_CH6_Main_13_014,"Wait!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_015,"Dammit, you runt! My little cutie got kidnapped because of you!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_016,"Hmph, why is that my fault! He ran off on his own, even though he was a weakling!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_017,"Miruru! A companion was kidnapped."
CS_CH6_Main_13_018,"Yes, Adin shares responsibility for running into danger himself,\nbut you also played part in the misunderstanding."
CS_CH6_Main_13_019,"Fr...Frey~ I'm sowwy...don't be angwy..."
CS_CH6_Main_13_020,"Hey, you! Stop acting all cute when you're supposed to be a Pirate Empress!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_021,"This isn't the time for all this! We have to save my little cutie!"
CS_CH6_Main_14_001,"Damn it, they got away."
CS_CH6_Main_14_002,"Lizardmen in the slave trade...I didn't know they were like that."
CS_CH6_Main_14_003,"Yeah, I don't know about killing, but they sure aren't the type to take slaves."
CS_CH6_Main_14_004,"We can still catch up. Let's hurry."
CS_CH6_Main_15_001,"Adin!!"
CS_CH6_Main_15_002,"Aah, you came!"
CS_CH6_Main_15_003,"Tch, can't be helped."
CS_CH6_Main_15_004,"Give me back my little cutie!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_001,"Thank you for helping me."
CS_CH6_Main_16_002,"Are you hurt anywhere, cutie?"
CS_CH6_Main_16_003,"Ah, what a relief. Your cute face is fine."
CS_CH6_Main_16_004,"Yes, thanks to everyone, I'm fine."
CS_CH6_Main_16_005,"Ah, and I heard a few tidbits about the treasure from the lizardmen."
CS_CH6_Main_16_006,"Treaaasurreee~~??"
CS_CH6_Main_16_007,"Yes. Apparently the lizardmen are also searching for the treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_16_008,"I think I may have just figured this out."
CS_CH6_Main_16_009,"Let's go find the treasure!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_010,"Yeah! Let's go! Let's take this treasure and head out to the Sea!!!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_011,"Roi, do you know if the lizardmen have any interest in treasure?"
CS_CH6_Main_16_012,"No. While they aren't quite accepting of the other races,\nthey aren't known to be materialistic."
CS_CH6_Main_16_013,"Sometimes there are a few odd ones...but those roam solo."
CS_CH6_Main_16_014,"There have been no cases of groups of lizardmen\nsearching for treasure or money in the past."
CS_CH6_Main_16_015,"I wonder if they have some kind of reason?"
CS_CH6_Main_16_016,"Well, it's been a while since anyone came in contact with them..."
CS_CH6_Main_16_017,"so there may have been some changes to their lifestyle."
CS_CH6_Main_16_018,"What are you all doing? Let's go get that treasure!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_019,"On the other hand, they said the lizardmen have some ties with the Power of Darkness..."
CS_CH6_Main_16_020,"It seems we have reason to investigate, then."
CS_CH6_Main_17_001,"Hey, that’s...!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_002,"A dwarfish helmet!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_003,"Heave...ho!!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_004,"Miruru: Eh?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_005,"Dwarf: Who are you, and why do you interrupt my sandbath."
CS_CH6_Main_17_006,"Miruru: Why on earth are you sandbathing all the way up to your head?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_007,"Dwarf: It's common knowledge that dwarves are closely related to the earth."
CS_CH6_Main_17_008,"Dwarf: Obviously we'd sandbath every bit of our body."
CS_CH6_Main_17_009,"Why are you even wearing clothes if you're sandbathing? It's a given you should be naked!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_010,"Do you really wanna see a dwarf gramp's naked body..."
CS_CH6_Main_17_011,"Tut tut, Cleo...you just don't get the charm of a dwarf."
CS_CH6_Main_17_012,"A chubby little belly, with tight, strong muscles covering the entire body.\nAn experienced dwarf, even if he is old, is great!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_013,"*Sigh*...You...are really something."
CS_CH6_Main_17_014,"I was just resting for a bit after mopping up some Demons, and this happens..."
CS_CH6_Main_17_015,"Demons? We haven't seen a single Demon since we entered the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_17_016,"Hahaha, well, I did do a through job!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_017,"From what I heard the Desert was overrun with them..."
CS_CH6_Main_17_018,"Well, that's true. Still, I was able to finish the job."
CS_CH6_Main_17_019,"After all, most of them were just lowly undead."
CS_CH6_Main_17_020,"That aside, what are you folk all doing in Aegina?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_021,"We're looking for the hidden treasure of the Desert!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_022,"You can just ignore that child, Master Dwarf."
CS_CH6_Main_17_023,"We're headed for the Barbarian Kingdom located in Windland."
CS_CH6_Main_17_024,"However, due to volcanic activity, we can't possibly cross through Dragia right now."
CS_CH6_Main_17_025,"Haha, I see. I too came from Dragia, but can't return due to the same reasons."
CS_CH6_Main_17_026,"Well, I've come to terms by taking a break, slaughtering demons in the meantime."
CS_CH6_Main_17_027,"Why don't we hunt down some more while we search for safe passage?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_028,"I'm sure we'll find one sooner or later."
CS_CH6_Main_18_001,"By my beard, is that the holy sword Aea?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_002,"Eh? How did you..."
CS_CH6_Main_18_003,"Wait... Aea? That Aea? The legendary holy sword?!"
CS_CH6_Main_18_004,"*Sigh*...again..."
CS_CH6_Main_18_005,"Well, if this isn't a joyful surprise."
CS_CH6_Main_18_006,"I fought alongside Kyle, who also wielded that sword."
CS_CH6_Main_18_007,"That means...you're the King of Dwarves, Phillop?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_008,"Hahaha, to think that the humans still remember my name."
CS_CH6_Main_18_009,"Wow~ The inheritor of the Holy Sword, and the King of Dwarves, all together."
CS_CH6_Main_18_010,"It is an honor to meet such great people."
CS_CH6_Main_18_011,"But what business does the King of Dwarves have in the Desert...?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_012,"Psh, King of Dwarves. I'm sick of that title, so stop that."
CS_CH6_Main_18_013,"Every time I try to leave the throne, I get re-elected."
CS_CH6_Main_18_014,"Lazy bums. They just don't want to deal with the responsibilities."
CS_CH6_Main_18_015,"Re-elected..?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_016,"From what I hear, the Dwarven Crown isn't inherited by royal bloodline,"
CS_CH6_Main_18_017,"but rather, they elect a King through a vote."
CS_CH6_Main_18_018,"That's a rather interesting concept."
CS_CH6_Main_18_019,"Ah, come to think of it. If you inherited the Sword, you too must be Ki..."
CS_CH6_Main_18_020,"Ah! I see some undead right over there. Phillop, are those the Demons you were hunting?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_021,"Hmm, yes. There were a few distractions, but since I'm all rested up - may the hunt resume!"
CS_CH6_Main_19_001,"Phillop."
CS_CH6_Main_19_002,"Ah, descendant of Kyle."
CS_CH6_Main_19_003,"I apologize for the inconvenience I may have caused you before.\nHahaha, I was just too happy to see you."
CS_CH6_Main_19_004,"You're hiding the truth about your lineage, correct?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_005,"Yes, that is true. Although I was also trying to hide the holy sword..."
CS_CH6_Main_19_006,"Haha..again, I apologize."
CS_CH6_Main_19_007,"I'm sure you have your reasons."
CS_CH6_Main_19_008,"Like any other position, the job of a king isn't an easy one,"
CS_CH6_Main_19_009,"and it just becomes harder when you try to do it properly."
CS_CH6_Main_19_010,"You're hiding your lineage because you have no wish to become king, correct?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_011,"For us humans,it is not right for one who is not king to even dream of the throne."
CS_CH6_Main_19_012,"Just the thought can turn one into a traitor, a rebel."
CS_CH6_Main_19_013,"As always, the humans and their squabbles over the crown stink of blood."
CS_CH6_Main_19_014,"Even in Kyle's time, many wished to kill him and take over the throne...\nand Kyle had to kill all of them."
CS_CH6_Main_19_015,"Is that true?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_016,"Haha, I guess his fame as a King of Heroes erased the bad reputation he once had."
CS_CH6_Main_19_017,"Good to see that his image as a cold blooded murderer\nstained with the blood of his half-brothers is gone."
CS_CH6_Main_19_018,"If only he didn't go missing,\nhe would have been able to spend the rest of his kingship happily and dutifully."
CS_CH6_Main_19_019,"Cold blooded...? Blood of his half-brothers...?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_020,"The Dwaves under my rule have long since had ties with Orvelia,\neven before the Demons invaded this world."
CS_CH6_Main_19_021,"Kyle was a good king, one who really worked hard for his subjects."
CS_CH6_Main_19_022,"However, nobody acknowledged his sacrifices.\nHis name only brought jeers and insults from the populace, that he killed his family to become king."
CS_CH6_Main_19_023,"It is regretful that it was so, considering the others had no interest\nin the responsibilities of the throne, but just its power."
CS_CH6_Main_19_024,"They even made the first move against Kyle, attempting to kill him..."
CS_CH6_Main_19_025,"I never knew..."
CS_CH6_Main_19_026,"Well, humans don't live for too long."
CS_CH6_Main_19_027,"I suppose the disastrous invasion of the Demons overwrote history in a good way."
CS_CH6_Main_19_028,"It's a tragedy that those forgotten issues are trying to take place again, though."
CS_CH6_Main_19_029,"That voice..."
CS_CH6_Main_19_030,"Reina?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_031,"Hmm..so you were royalty, huh."
CS_CH6_Main_19_032,"Since when were you listening?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_033,"From the beginning?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_034,"After all, Kasel, I followed you here."
CS_CH6_Main_19_035,"Ah, um...what do you need?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_036,"*Sigh* C'mon, no need to worry. I know what you're worried about."
CS_CH6_Main_19_037,"How to say this...Kasel, you're not really my type of guy. You're...kinda boring."
CS_CH6_Main_19_038,"Is...is that so."
CS_CH6_Main_19_039,"I just had something to say, that's all."
CS_CH6_Main_19_040,"You remember I said I went to Orvelia to get some contracts, but found no good jobs?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_041,"Ah, yes."
CS_CH6_Main_19_042,"Well, they tried to hire me to kill the successor to the holy sword."
CS_CH6_Main_19_043,"I mean, what kind of bad joke is that? Why would you hire a mercenary for a hit?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_044,"I swear the nobility of Orvelia swapped their common sense for cow manure."
CS_CH6_Main_19_045,"Anyway, I guess it was because the successor of the holy sword is also of royalty."
CS_CH6_Main_19_046,"The Orvelian nobilty..."
CS_CH6_Main_19_047,"I guess they knew the sword is inherited by royal blood."
CS_CH6_Main_19_048,"Hmph, not again...when will they ever learn."
CS_CH6_Main_19_049,"Huh, I thought you'd be more surprised? Even your reactions are dull."
CS_CH6_Main_19_050,"Well, I was...kind of expecting it."
CS_CH6_Main_19_051,"I heard a lot of things on the way."
CS_CH6_Main_19_052,"Reina, could you please pretend that you didn't hear anything today?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_053,"Hmm, well, ok. But could you let me grope Roi a bit in exchange?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_054,"Uh...I don't think I have the right..."
CS_CH6_Main_20_001,"Cleo, this is..."
CS_CH6_Main_20_002,"Yeah...That's definitely the Power of Darkness."
CS_CH6_Main_20_003,"Everyone, stop. Quiet..."
CS_CH6_Main_20_004,"Cleo. Are you sensing the Darkness from that gaudy gold-covered one?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_005,"I can't tell from this distance."
CS_CH6_Main_20_006,"For now, I think it's best we lay low and watch."
CS_CH6_Main_20_007,"Izakerr, I don't understand."
CS_CH6_Main_20_008,"Since when did we care for treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_20_009,"So...are you saying you don't like gold?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_010,"No, not that. But that's exactly what's weird."
CS_CH6_Main_20_011,"We never wanted for such things."
CS_CH6_Main_20_012,"We never wished for riches."
CS_CH6_Main_20_013,"But now, we're searching for treasure like our lives depend on it,\neven while sustaining losses."
CS_CH6_Main_20_014,"Now that I think of it, this is all really odd."
CS_CH6_Main_20_015,"Hmph, have you grown senile already?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_016,"I'll help jog your memory."
CS_CH6_Main_20_017,"Behold all this gold! Bask in its brilliance, its radiance and glory!"
CS_CH6_Main_20_018,"The Power of Darkness...it's growing stronger."
CS_CH6_Main_20_019,"How...how beautiful."
CS_CH6_Main_20_020,"Ah, I think I may grow blind. I want it. I want the shinies..."
CS_CH6_Main_20_021,"I guess Greed is the catalyst for the lizardmen."
CS_CH6_Main_20_022,"Everyone has a desire to own what they wish for,"
CS_CH6_Main_20_023,"but greed beyond one's capabilities will only ruin people and those around them..."
CS_CH6_Main_20_024,"Now, what do you think. Don't you want to go search for more treasure?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_025,"Yes! I want more! I also want to cover myself in gold like you!"
CS_CH6_Main_20_026,"Go forth! We shall erect our own empire of gold!"
CS_CH6_Main_20_027,"Now that we know what the catalyst is, there is no need to stay in hiding."
CS_CH6_Main_20_028,"Cleo, can we save those lizardmen from the Darkness?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_029,"Piece of cake. Well, we only have to beat up that one called Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_20_030,"Good. Let's go."
CS_CH6_Main_21_001,"Who are you."
CS_CH6_Main_21_002,"Corrupting your own peaceful race with darkness and greed,"
CS_CH6_Main_21_003,"how could you call yourself a leader of your race like that?"
CS_CH6_Main_21_004,"You misunderstand. We originally had no leader. Everyone lived their own way."
CS_CH6_Main_21_005,"I too lived my own life, far away from my race."
CS_CH6_Main_21_006,"I dreamt of a better life beyond the horizon,"
CS_CH6_Main_21_007,"unlike my brothers who lived drearily with no aspirations at all."
CS_CH6_Main_21_008,"So...that great dream was nothing more than a measly treasure hunt?"
CS_CH6_Main_21_009,"You too seem to be fools stuck in the present."
CS_CH6_Main_21_010,"How sad, to think even the humans were afflicted with such sloth."
CS_CH6_Main_21_011,"I have no time for the likes of you. I must go find my treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_21_012,"....."
CS_CH6_Main_21_013,"Wait, that's just running away!"
CS_CH6_Main_21_014,"Well, I can understand his feelings, and the call of treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_21_015,"Poor Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_21_016,"Hm? Why would you say that..."
CS_CH6_Main_21_017,"Well, he's probably like me, and found some kind of cursed treasure in the past."
CS_CH6_Main_21_018,"Dreaming of a better life...beyond the horizon?"
CS_CH6_Main_21_019,"I swear he has been cursed with the power of cheesiness."
CS_CH6_Main_21_020,"Ah, I'm so sad. Frey, cheer me up, please? Huggies~"
CS_CH6_Main_21_021,"...I swear you're the cheesy one here."
CS_CH6_Main_22_001,"Cleo, can you save Izakerr too?"
CS_CH6_Main_22_002,"*Sigh*...Frey, there's no need to take guys like that into consideration."
CS_CH6_Main_22_003,"It would be easier to just take him out."
CS_CH6_Main_22_004,"But...even Miruru said she felt bad for him..."
CS_CH6_Main_22_005,"Grr, don't take everything she says so seriously!"
CS_CH6_Main_22_006,"But Cleo...even so, I want to give Izakerr a chance."
CS_CH6_Main_22_007,"*Sigh*...all right, all right. If you say so, Frey."
CS_CH6_Main_22_008,"Let's give it a try. We've succeeded once before, after all."
CS_CH6_Main_23_001,"You...!!"
CS_CH6_Main_23_002,"Hmph, I see. Even though you said otherwise,\nI see you too were interested in the treasure here."
CS_CH6_Main_23_003,"No, we just had business with you personally, Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_23_004,"I have no idea how you learned how to control the Power of Darkness,"
CS_CH6_Main_23_005,"but that power will eventually lead you and your race to ruin."
CS_CH6_Main_23_006,"Hmph, I won't be fooled."
CS_CH6_Main_23_007,"This power is exactly what I need to unify my race!"
CS_CH6_Main_23_008,"No way we're talking our way through this one."
CS_CH6_Main_23_009,"I won't let anyone else take it! The treasure of Aegina is mine!!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_001,"Just a moment, Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_24_002,"We'll save you from the Darkness now."
CS_CH6_Main_24_003,"Hmph, I refuse. Hahaha..I have no regrets."
CS_CH6_Main_24_004,"I want to die living my life, just like this."
CS_CH6_Main_24_005,"If that is your last wish...rest in peace."
CS_CH6_Main_24_006,"Hmm? Wait, I don't see Adin."
CS_CH6_Main_24_007,"Adin? Where are you, cutie~?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_008,"Isn't this bad? He may have been hurt by those lizardmen!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_009,"I saw him sneaking off while we were dealing with the lizardmen."
CS_CH6_Main_24_010,"From his expression, I'm pretty sure he was filled with hope of finding the treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_24_011,"What? You let that helpless child just wander off?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_012,"That's low, even if you were jealous of him."
CS_CH6_Main_24_013,"You wish."
CS_CH6_Main_24_014,"Regardless, everything will be fine.\nAfter Izakerr died, I'm sure all the lizardmen were freed from the Power of Darkness."
CS_CH6_Main_24_015,"Adin won't be in any trouble."
CS_CH6_Main_24_016,"Hmm...ok. Well, what are your future plans now?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_017,"Eh, I'll stick around Aegina for a bit longer, cleaning up any leftover Demons."
CS_CH6_Main_24_018,"Roi?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_019,"None of your business."
CS_CH6_Main_24_020,"We'll continue looking for a way to the Windland Mountains."
CS_CH6_Main_24_021,"Hmm...what do I do..."
CS_CH6_Main_24_022,"I do want to follow Roi, and I don't mind following Phillop either..."
CS_CH6_Main_24_023,"Ah! Well, Adin may still get in other kinds of trouble,\nso it will be best if I go and be his bodyguard!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_024,"That's a good idea."
CS_CH6_Main_24_025,"Haha, Reina isn't even mentioning me as usual...I feel a bit left out."
CS_CH6_Main_24_026,"Well, Kasel, you have Selene."
CS_CH6_Main_24_027,"That's only because of the Holy Sword."
CS_CH6_Main_24_028,"Well...not like I was ever popular or anything."
CS_CH6_Main_24_029,"Frey, I'm gonna go find the treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_24_030,"After that, I'll become a truly great pirate, and come to get you."
CS_CH6_Main_24_031,"Let's go out to the Sea together!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_032,"No! Frey has her own path to follow."
CS_CH6_Main_24_033,"Go to the Sea on your own!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_034,"You know, you keep trying to get between me and Frey,\nand it's honestly starting to tick me off."
CS_CH6_Main_24_035,"I was part of this party before you even showed up!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_036,"See, Kasel. Taking Frey's current predicament into consideration,"
CS_CH6_Main_24_037,"don't you think it could be better to be unpopular?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_038,"That suuuuure makes me feel a lot better."
CS_CH6_Main_24_039,"Anyway, we really should go find a road towards the Windland Mountains."
CS_CH6_Main_25_001,"Huh, there's a path here..."
CS_CH6_Main_25_002,"Did anyone know that this path existed?"
CS_CH6_Main_25_003,"Yes, I remember that in the past,\nthere was a path from Aegina that lead towards Windland,"
CS_CH6_Main_25_004,"but after the Dark Lord disappeared, it was sealed off."
CS_CH6_Main_25_005,"I wonder if the reappearance of the Demons has anything to do\nwith the seal being undone."
CS_CH6_Main_25_006,"That might be the case."
CS_CH6_Main_25_007,"It may be dangerous...but this is probably our only way through."
CS_CH6_Main_25_008,"Don't worry, Kasel. We've been through a lot of dangerous situations already."
CS_CH6_Main_25_009,"Yeah, everywhere that's not home is dangerous, anyway."
CS_CH6_Main_25_010,"Haha, well, that's true. Still, we're finally near Windland, and the Barbarian Kingdom."
CS_CH6_Main_25_011,"I hope our journey ends soon so we could go home and sleep under a nice roof."
CS_CH6_Main_25_012,"Great! C'mon, lets get to that Kingdom already."
CS_CH6_Main_25_013,"Finally, Arlette..."
CS_CH6_Main_25_014,"Your child has come back."
CH6_Sub_1_001,"As expected, the Desert has scorpions..."
CH6_Sub_1_002,"Careful, Kasel. Scorpions are rather dangerous."
CH6_Sub_1_003,"Those huge pincers are rather impressive."
CH6_Sub_1_004,"True...Mmm."
CH6_Sub_1_005,"Roi, I think Kasel is impressed by those pincers in a different way..."
CH6_Sub_1_006,"Yeah, I could tell once he started making that noise."
CH6_Sub_1_007,"The pincers are tastiest when it comes to these."
CH6_Sub_1_008,"Let's go!"
CH6_Sub_1_009,"Don't get too excited, Kasel! You'll get hurt."
CH6_Sub_2_001,"What heat. Can we really pass through Dragia?"
CH6_Sub_2_002,"Urgh, it's quite different from what it was like before..."
CH6_Sub_2_003,"Cleo, have you been to Dragia before?"
CH6_Sub_2_004,"Yeah, the first place I went to after I left the Tower was Dragia."
CH6_Sub_2_005,"I came here looking for clues about my mom..."
CH6_Sub_2_006,"Were there none?"
CH6_Sub_2_007,"Yeah...that's why I went to Orvelia."
CH6_Sub_2_008,"Were you planning on crossing through Dragia?"
CH6_Sub_2_009,"It's impossible. The volcano became active recently, it's too dangerous."
CH6_Sub_2_010,"*Sigh*...What now?"
CH6_Sub_2_011,"What now? What do you mean, what now?\nYou should help think of a way to go out to the Sea with me!"
CH6_Sub_2_012,"*Sigh*...We need to get to Windland. We have no time for your games."
CH6_Sub_2_013,"Well, we still have to figure out the relationship between the lizardmen and the Darkness."
CH6_Sub_2_014,"In the meantime, hopefully we might find a different road -\nor the volcano may go dormant."
CH7_Main_0_001,"Everything is ruined because of you. If it wasn't for you...Kyle would have never turned out that way!!"
CH7_Main_0_002,"Yes...It's all my fault...I guess...I must die..."
CH7_Main_0_003,"We elves will not judge whether a single human must die or not."
CH7_Main_0_004,"However, your baby must live."
CH7_Main_0_005,"Lorraine, that woman has lost everything."
CH7_Main_0_006,"It would not be surprising if she hated even her child at this very moment."
CH7_Main_0_007,"Come. A good night's sleep will make everything better. That should be enough."
CH7_Main_0_008,"We may need the help of that child one day, as well."
CH7_Main_0_009,"Will II stop hating you once I wake up..."
CH7_Main_0_010,"I can't help you live in luxury,"
CH7_Main_0_011,"but I can lay my life down for you."
CH7_Main_0_012,"That is the one thing no noble or king can do for you."
CH7_Main_1_001,"That's...a tiger. A pretty big one, too."
CH7_Main_1_002,"Kasel, you were thinking you could eat your full for once if we caught that, right?"
CH7_Main_1_003,"Ahaha...Frey, you know me too well."
CH7_Main_1_004,"Well, it seems the tiger is pretty hungry too."
CH7_Main_1_005,"One wrong move and we could be the ones to become food."
CH7_Main_1_006,"Hah, don't worry! One special archmage barbecue coming right up."
CH7_Main_2_001,"Hey, you! Why are you interfering with my hunt!"
CH7_Main_2_002,"Eh? Do you mean us?"
CH7_Main_2_003,"Yeah! That tiger was mine!"
CH7_Main_2_004,"What?! Didn't you see us catching that tiger?"
CH7_Main_2_005,"The tiger was moving too much because of you, so I couldn't take the shot."
CH7_Main_2_006,"Ugh...Kasel, say something."
CH7_Main_2_007,"Hmm...Cleo, let's give the tiger to her."
CH7_Main_2_008,"Eh? Kasel, are you really giving up on food?"
CH7_Main_2_009,"Well, if she had her sights on it first, it can't be helped."
CH7_Main_2_010,"Wait, what about our efforts in catching it?"
CH7_Main_2_011,"Cleo, we would have had to fight that tiger anyhow if we were to pass through this road."
CH7_Main_2_012,"Wow, you're all so nice. I'm Rodina, pleased to meet you. Well then, I'll be taking the tiger!"
CH7_Main_2_013,"Just a second, Rodina. Do you know where the Barbarian Kingdom is?"
CH7_Main_2_014,"Eh? Oh, that kingdom is no more. Anyway, thanks!"
CH7_Main_2_015,"Eh? Wa...wait!"
CH7_Main_2_016,"Ah...well, there she goes. Dammit."
CH7_Main_2_017,"We lost our tiger and the Barbarian Kingdom is gone..."
CH7_Main_2_018,"Let's try to find some remaining Barbarians, then."
CH7_Main_3_001,"That...looks like a Barbarian, right?"
CH7_Main_3_002,"Why is he fighting with the harpies?"
CH7_Main_3_003,"Let's go and ask."
CH7_Main_3_004,"Humans...hmph, no doubt you're here to help the Barbarians, as kindred primates!"
CH7_Main_3_005,"Eh?"
CH7_Main_3_006,"Disappear!!"
CH7_Main_3_007,"Wait, we wanted to talk..."
CH7_Main_3_008,"I don't think that's likely."
CH7_Main_3_009,"They're attacking!"
CH7_Main_4_001,"Ah...sorry, sorry. I got you caught up in my little scuffle."
CH7_Main_4_002,"It's fine. We were looking for a Barbarian, after all."
CH7_Main_4_003,"What for?"
CH7_Main_4_004,"We heard that...the Barbarian Kingdom has fallen."
CH7_Main_4_005,"Do you know what happened?"
CH7_Main_4_006,"I wasn't here when that happened, so i don't know the details."
CH7_Main_4_007,"However, apparently every other race on Windland is now hostile to the Barbarians."
CH7_Main_4_008,"I hear they all bonded together to overthrow the Barbarian Kingdom."
CH7_Main_4_009,"So that's why the harpies..."
CH7_Main_4_010,"Weren't the Barbarians originally warring against the Frost Giants?"
CH7_Main_4_011,"Yeah. The Frost Giants were the first to attack, too."
CH7_Main_4_012,"I have no idea why the other races took their side..."
CH7_Main_4_013,"The war didn't make any sense to begin with."
CH7_Main_4_014,"King Musuclow, the Barbarian King at the time of the Demon Invasion,"
CH7_Main_4_015,"and the Tarkas, the Frost Giant King, worked together to defeat the Demons."
CH7_Main_4_016,"If the legends are true, they were very good friends."
CH7_Main_4_017,"While 100 years have passed, even now"
CH7_Main_4_018,"nobody knows why Tarkas and King Musuclow came to conflict."
CH7_Main_4_019,"Even so, it wasn't as if they actually fought back then; they merely stopped communicating with each other."
CH7_Main_4_020,"Yes, I heard Tarkas only started attacking the Barbarian Kingdom after King Musuclow passed away."
CH7_Main_4_021,"Hmm, considering Frost Giants have a lifespan that is about 10 times longer than the average human...Tarkas must still be alive."
CH7_Main_4_022,"Was he trying to honor his late friend till the last moment?"
CH7_Main_4_023,"What use is all that?!"
CH7_Main_4_024,"In the end, our Kingdom was destroyed by his hand."
CH7_Main_4_025,"My entire race has been reduced to living in hiding, scattered across Windland."
CH7_Main_4_026,"Now those harpies...they are hunting down every single straggler merely trying to live in hiding."
CH7_Main_4_027,"Why are they doing such a thing..."
CH7_Main_4_028,"I want to know too. So much has happened while I was away from the Kingdom."
CH7_Main_4_029,"Although the others...they refuse to meet with me."
CH7_Main_4_030,"Can't blame them. From their point of view, I ditched all my responsibilities and ran away."
CH7_Main_4_031,"So, for now we have no leads on the whereabouts of the last Barbarian King..."
CH7_Main_4_032,"Well, it can't hurt to try. I'll help."
CH7_Main_5_001,"*Sigh*...things just became very complicated."
CH7_Main_5_002,"I was hoping that the Barbarian Kingdom was the key"
CH7_Main_5_003,"to us finding out how to recover the rest of the Holy Sword's power."
CH7_Main_5_004,"....Kasel."
CH7_Main_5_005,"What do you plan to do...after you find out how to recover its power?"
CH7_Main_5_006,"I remember you said you would hold on to the Sword for the time being."
CH7_Main_5_007,"You didn't recover the Sword's Power back in Ogria."
CH7_Main_5_008,"I am not...thinking about the future, just yet."
CH7_Main_5_009,"For now, I'm just doing what I can."
CH7_Main_5_010,"I do hope some of the Barbarian royalty survived the war."
CH7_Main_5_011,"Yes. I don't know about the area above the cliffs, but down here, there isn't too much ground to cover."
CH7_Main_5_012,"As long as I know someone is targeting my life..."
CH7_Main_5_013,"I can't return to the life I had before I received the Holy Sword."
CH7_Main_6_001,"Wow! Dryads, even in all this snow!"
CH7_Main_6_002,"I guess the Dryads here haven't been corrupted?"
CH7_Main_6_003,"They haven't been corrupted, but..."
CH7_Main_6_004,"Humans?"
CH7_Main_6_005,"While they aren't Barbarians, they are still of humankind!"
CH7_Main_6_006,"*Sigh*...as I was trying to say,"
CH7_Main_6_007,"every race here has become hostile to humankind as a whole."
CH7_Main_6_008,"What, even the nice and gentle Dryads have become your enemy?"
CH7_Main_6_009,"The heck were you Barbarians doing here?"
CH7_Main_6_010,"Cleo, Gau wasn't here while this all happened."
CH7_Main_6_011,"Yeah, I think we should at least know why we are being attacked."
CH7_Main_6_012,"Dryads, could you please tell us why you are hostile towards humanity?"
CH7_Main_6_013,"Do you really not know."
CH7_Main_6_014,"100 years ago, humanity was the race that brought the Demons to this world"
CH7_Main_6_015,"And now, they have allied themselves with Demons once again. Humans are a blight upon this world."
CH7_Main_6_016,"...Wha...what...."
CH7_Main_6_017,"No. No....that can't be true."
CH7_Main_6_018,"Disappear!!"
CH7_Main_7_001,"Aah, damnit! This is all so unfair!"
CH7_Main_7_002,"The harpies, the orcs, the dark elves - they made deals with the Demons, not us!"
CH7_Main_7_003,"It's not just the Barbarians that worked with Demons!"
CH7_Main_7_004,"Who the hell would work with Demons?!"
CH7_Main_7_005,"Come on, that's the only explanation for this."
CH7_Main_7_006,"The only humans that live in Windland are you Barbarians,"
CH7_Main_7_007,"so if every other race turned on you, wouldn't that be why?"
CH7_Main_7_008,"We don't know anything for sure, yet."
CH7_Main_7_009,"For all we know, this could be a plot to destroy the Barbarians!"
CH7_Main_7_010,"He's right, Cleo. There's not enough information yet."
CH7_Main_7_011,"We need to investigate a bit further."
CH7_Main_7_012,"*Sigh*...You're right. I was just annoyed because we were attacked for no reason."
CH7_Main_7_013,"Yeah, considering what we went through to get here...it is a bit unfair."
CH7_Main_7_014,"Well, it's true that the rumors say a human opened the Dimension Gate."
CH7_Main_7_015,"Well, at this point I don't really think that was an accident anymore..."
CH7_Main_8_001,"Frost Giants!!"
CH7_Main_8_002,"Oh, that man is....Gau!?"
CH7_Main_8_003,"We thought you were dead, since you never showed your face!"
CH7_Main_8_004,"You don't seem to know each other..."
CH7_Main_8_005,"Considering they know who you are, I guess you were quite famous, eh?"
CH7_Main_8_006,"Stories of the past. My homeland has perished, so what use is there in past glory."
CH7_Main_8_007,"He's a dangerous one. Kill him at all costs!!"
CH7_Main_9_001,"Oh, isn't that Rodina?"
CH7_Main_9_002,"Ah! Hello~. Nice to see some friendly faces. Would you help me for a bit?"
CH7_Main_9_003,"What's going on?"
CH7_Main_9_004,"There are some Frost Giants trying to attack my residence."
CH7_Main_9_005,"I would like to discuss the specifics after we get rid of them..."
CH7_Main_10_001,"Thank you, thank you."
CH7_Main_10_002,"Do you live around here?"
CH7_Main_10_003,"Yes, I do,"
CH7_Main_10_004,"Is that so... Could we borrow your place for one night? As thanks?"
CH7_Main_10_005,"Mmm...is anyone of you named Kasel, by the way?"
CH7_Main_10_006,"I'm Kasel. How did you know my name...?"
CH7_Main_10_007,"Ah, so it was you people."
CH7_Main_10_008,"Let us go. There is someone waiting for you."
CH7_Main_11_001,"This is..."
CH7_Main_11_002,"Is this the Sealed Ice Cavern?"
CH7_Main_11_003,"Yes, it is."
CH7_Main_11_004,"You live here?"
CH7_Main_11_005,"For now, yes."
CH7_Main_11_006,"I heard this place was sealed with magic for over a thousand years."
CH7_Main_11_007,"That seal was broken?!"
CH7_Main_11_008,"That's just how it was known. People have been coming and going around here for some time now."
CH7_Main_11_009,"How are you so calm about this! This place is supposed to be a big deal between sorcerers!!"
CH7_Main_11_010,"It was sealed by magic, and you're not even a spellcaster!"
CH7_Main_11_011,"I never said I was the Master of this cavern."
CH7_Main_11_012,"Wait, you did say someone was waiting for us..."
CH7_Main_11_013,"Is that person..."
CH7_Main_11_014,"Yes, he's the one. Let us go."
CH7_Main_12_001,"*Sigh*...not again."
CH7_Main_12_002,"Wa..wait. This is different from the rumors!"
CH7_Main_12_003,"Why are there demons here?!"
CH7_Main_12_004,"Well, rumors are rumors, and quite a number of frozen bodies were just left behind over time."
CH7_Main_12_005,"Simply, they turned into undead."
CH7_Main_12_006,"We couldn't stop the power of darkness from invading these caverns."
CH7_Main_12_007,"Demons, even in these lands...what the hell happened here?"
CH7_Main_12_008,"Eh? You're a Barbarian, and you don't even know about that?"
CH7_Main_12_009,"Your King made a deal with the Demon, Malduk."
CH7_Main_12_010,"Wh...what? Don't lie to me!"
CH7_Main_12_011,"I wouldn't lie. It's my mission keep a look out for all that happens around these lands."
CH7_Main_12_012,"I know everything that happened recently, at least."
CH7_Main_12_013,"That...there's no way..."
CH7_Main_12_014,"...Could you explain in more detail."
CH7_Main_12_015,"Well, it can wait."
CH7_Main_12_016,"We should probably bury those corpses first."
CH7_Main_13_001,"Are you ready to listen?"
CH7_Main_13_002,"....Yes."
CH7_Main_13_003,"How long has it been since you left your Kingdom?"
CH7_Main_13_004,"About...10 years."
CH7_Main_13_005,"It's no surprise you didn't know what was going on, then."
CH7_Main_13_006,"When I received my mission and was dispatched to this area,"
CH7_Main_13_007,"which was about 3 years ago...the Barbarian Kingdom was already in shambles."
CH7_Main_13_008,"The long war caused many Barbarian refugees to wander around,"
CH7_Main_13_009,"and considering their rough, brutal nature, they survived by plundering Harpies and Dryads."
CH7_Main_13_010,"So that's why...everyone turned against us."
CH7_Main_13_011,"Not really. Those who joined in the war against humanity were not that numerous."
CH7_Main_13_012,"Still, even those small numbers made a difference."
CH7_Main_13_013,"In the end, the Barbarian Kingdom was on the brink of Ruin."
CH7_Main_13_014,"That was when Malduk visited the Barbarian King."
CH7_Main_13_015,"*Sigh*...Malduk, that name gives me the headaches now."
CH7_Main_13_016,"The rest is simple as day, I guess."
CH7_Main_13_017,"Cleo, don't be so blunt in front of Gau."
CH7_Main_13_018,"It's fine..."
CH7_Main_13_019,"So thats how the Undead came to be in Windland..."
CH7_Main_13_020,"Yes, that was the Barbarian King's worst decision."
CH7_Main_13_021,"It's obvious."
CH7_Main_13_022,"Everyone would most definitely turn against the Barbarians after such a decision."
CH7_Main_13_023,"If I hadn't left...maybe things wouldn't have turned out so horribly..."
CH7_Main_13_024,"Gau, you had your own path to follow..."
CH7_Main_13_025,"This isn't your fault."
CH7_Main_14_001,"No!!!!!"
CH7_Main_14_002,"That voice...Pavel!!"
CH7_Main_14_003,"What in the world..."
CH7_Main_14_004,"Rodina: Pavel!! What's going on!!"
CH7_Main_14_005,"Pavel: Ugh...Tarkas...why..."
CH7_Main_14_006,"Tarkas: This woman, Arlette...she's the reason Kyle turned out that way."
CH7_Main_14_007,"Cleo: Arlette...? That person is..."
CH7_Main_14_008,"Wait for me, Pavel. I'll..."
CH7_Main_14_009,"Hah, too late. Come, Arlette. It's time to pay for your sins."
CH7_Main_14_010,"Arlette: ....."
CH7_Main_14_011,"Kasel: M...mother...."
CH7_Main_14_012,"Cleo: What? Kasel's...mother? But she's un...undead..."
CH7_Main_14_013,"Tarkas!!!"
CH7_Main_14_014,"Guh, damn you..."
CH7_Main_14_015,"We used too much power fighting Pavel."
CH7_Main_14_016,"We have to retreat for now!"
CH7_Main_14_017,"Ugh, can't be helped...We retreat, for now. Take Pavel."
CH7_Main_14_018,"I won't let you!!"
CH7_Main_14_019,"Arlette: ....."
CH7_Main_14_020,"Kasel: Mo..mother...how..."
CH7_Main_14_021,"Roi: Don't, Kasel! She's merely a corpse! She's Undead!!"
CH7_Main_14_022,"Frey: No, Kasel!!"
CH7_Main_14_023,"Kasel: Frey!!!"
CH7_Main_14_024,"Arlette: ....."
CH7_Main_14_025,"Frey: Ah....good...Kasel is...fine..."
CH7_Main_14_026,"Kasel: Fr...Frey...why...."
CH7_Main_14_027,"Frey: Kasel...you have to...save...the w..world..."
CH7_Main_14_028,"Frey: ....."
CH7_Main_14_029,"Kasel: Frey....Frey!!!"
CH7_Main_14_030,"No..no...this can't be..."
CH7_Main_14_031,"Wait...it seems we are the next targets."
CH7_Main_14_032,"This...can't..."
CH7_Main_14_033,"Damnit...it can't be helped."
CH7_Main_14_034,"Roi: Hraaaagh!!"
CH7_Main_14_035,"Roi: C'mon, all of you...get yourselves together!!"
CH7_Main_14_036,"Again...because of me..."
CH7_Main_14_037,"Because of me...Frey...you died because of me...."
CH7_Main_14_038,"Why...why me."
CH7_Main_14_039,"The Holy Sword...I never wanted it."
CH7_Main_14_040,"I'm done."
CH7_Main_14_041,"It's all over."
CH7_Main_14_042,"Kasel."
CH7_Main_14_043,"Fre....Frey?"
CH7_Main_14_044,"Why...did we come all this way."
CH7_Main_14_045,"The paths we walked...many others lost their lives. Nameless graves, unknown to anyone."
CH7_Main_14_046,"Even so, we needed to fight. We needed to protect ourselves."
CH7_Main_14_047,"This may all be one horrible excuse, but it was needed to stop a bigger tragedy from happening."
CH7_Main_14_048,"No one wanted this, but the fate of this world was placed in our hands."
CH7_Main_14_049,"But...it's all over."
CH7_Main_14_050,"What could I do...without you."
CH7_Main_14_051,"I caused many deaths...now it's simply my turn."
CH7_Main_14_052,"Kasel..."
CH7_Main_14_053,"I don't want you to fall into the Darkness because of me."
CH7_Main_14_054,"My path was to keep you from being corrupted."
CH7_Main_14_055,"Please, Kasel."
CH7_Main_14_056,"Let me finish my job...stand, and fight."
CH7_Main_14_057,"Frey..."
CH7_Main_14_058,"I'll try. For you...I'll stand."
CH7_Main_14_059,"Thank you."
CH7_Main_14_060,"Thank you, Kasel."
CH7_Main_14_061,"This...this is..."
CH7_Main_14_062,"Frey...?"
CH7_Main_14_063,"Ho..how..."
CH7_Main_14_064,"Ka...sel...?"
CH7_Main_14_065,"I'm...alive?"
CH7_Main_14_066,"That...that's what I wanted to ask, Frey."
CH7_Main_14_067,"You're alive...right?"
CH7_Main_14_068,"I think so."
CH7_Main_14_069,"Frey~~!!"
CH7_Main_15_001,"They disappeared for now...but what were those wings?"
CH7_Main_15_002,"Wings?"
CH7_Main_15_003,"I dunno...they did look like those of an Angel, though."
CH7_Main_15_004,"But I never heard of Angels with such huge wings, nor did I know they could hide them..."
CH7_Main_15_005,"Kasel...are you ok?"
CH7_Main_15_006,"Yeah...thanks to you."
CH7_Main_15_007,"Thank you for being alive, Frey."
CH7_Main_15_008,"Yes."
CH7_Main_15_009,"Well, can't stay here forever."
CH7_Main_15_010,"Pavel, right? He probably knows a lot about all this."
CH7_Main_15_011,"Let's go and save him."
CH7_Main_16_001,"Rodina! Is Pavel safe?"
CH7_Main_16_002,"Yes, we saved him - but we should still be cautious."
CH7_Main_16_003,"What about Gau?"
CH7_Main_16_004,"He went after Tarkas."
CH7_Main_16_005,"We should deal with the Frost Giants in the vicinity first, then."
CH7_Main_17_001,"It seems we've dealt with most of them now."
CH7_Main_17_002,"Are you alright, Pavel?"
CH7_Main_17_003,"Are you Kasel...what about...Arlette..."
CH7_Main_17_004,"I finished her off. It was the only way."
CH7_Main_17_005,"....I see."
CH7_Main_17_006,"How did mother...turn into an Undead?"
CH7_Main_17_007,"She was killed by Undead, so it shouldn't come as a surprise."
CH7_Main_17_008,"When I arrived at your village...she had already turned into one of them."
CH7_Main_17_009,"You knew her...?"
CH7_Main_17_010,"Around 100 years ago...I sealed her in ice."
CH7_Main_17_011,"Around that time...she was already pregnant with you."
CH7_Main_17_012,"That...that means..."
CH7_Main_17_013,"You should know your lineage now."
CH7_Main_17_014,"Eh? What? What is this about?"
CH7_Main_17_015,"I...have the blood of Orvelian Royalty."
CH7_Main_17_016,"I knew I was a descendant of Kyle..."
CH7_Main_17_017,"But if that was 100 years ago...wouldn't that mean..."
CH7_Main_17_018,"Yeah..I guess that makes me...King Kyle's son."
CH7_Main_17_019,"Is that true, Pavel?"
CH7_Main_17_020,"Yes, it is."
CH7_Main_17_021,"Why...did you seal my mother in ice?"
CH7_Main_17_022,"Did she do anything wrong?"
CH7_Main_17_023,"No. It was nothing to me."
CH7_Main_17_024,"When she was trying to give up on life..."
CH7_Main_17_025,"I just...told her, it would all be fine after a good night's sleep."
CH7_Main_17_026,"Mother was...trying to give up on life?"
CH7_Main_17_027,"What happened?"
CH7_Main_17_028,"Arlette is a woman Kyle met on his journey to save the world from Demonkind."
CH7_Main_17_029,"When he left her to finish his journey, she was pregnant with you."
CH7_Main_17_030,"The Demons knew of this, and attacked her village, killing everyone."
CH7_Main_17_031,"Simply, they thought by killing everyone, they would be rid of you and her."
CH7_Main_17_032,"So how..did my mother survive?"
CH7_Main_17_033,"Before Kyle met your mother, she had a fiance."
CH7_Main_17_034,"While he broke up with her for her future..."
CH7_Main_17_035,"He came back to save her from death, dying in the process."
CH7_Main_17_036,"Arlette lost everything she loved. In the end, she wanted to die, hating herself and Kyle for all that happened."
CH7_Main_17_037,"I'm sorry to say this...but at that moment, she hated everything, even the baby inside her."
CH7_Main_17_038,"That was...what it was like."
CH7_Main_17_039,"Arlette...didn't love King Kyle?"
CH7_Main_17_040,"I have no knowledge of their exact thoughts."
CH7_Main_17_041,"I can only know what I have seen."
CH7_Main_17_042,"Thus, my story ends there."
CH7_Main_17_043,"Thank you for telling us. It all seems very complicated..."
CH7_Main_17_044,"Uh, what about my father...the man who raised me?"
CH7_Main_17_045,"He wasn't your biological father, while he was your guardian."
CH7_Main_17_046,"Wait, you're human, right...you lived over 100 years?"
CH7_Main_17_047,"I'll tell you about that later."
CH7_Main_18_001,"Hm. The Holy Sword's power is weak. Have you not recovered the rest of its power?"
CH7_Main_18_002,"We only recovered 1 part of the power."
CH7_Main_18_003,"Yes, I heard from Lorraine. So you didn't find Aeatola's portion?"
CH7_Main_18_004,"I did find it...but I decided that it was too dangerous to recover it at that moment."
CH7_Main_18_005,"I kept losing control of the Sword..."
CH7_Main_18_006,"I see. Tell me if you need to recover its power."
CH7_Main_18_007,"I will return the power I hold."
CH7_Main_18_008,"You have a fragment of Aea's power?"
CH7_Main_18_009,"Musuclow left it with me."
CH7_Main_18_010,"He knew that the Barbarian Kingdom would be in peril after he died."
CH7_Main_18_011,"King Musuclow..."
CH7_Main_18_012,"The power of the Holy Sword was divided into 3 parts."
CH7_Main_18_013,"As soon as you decide that you are capable of controlling the power by yourself, you will be able to complete the Sword."
CH7_Main_18_014,"Is there no way to stop the Demons without doing so?"
CH7_Main_18_015,"That is a useless question."
CH7_Main_18_016,"If they were so easy to stop, they would have never be a threat."
CH7_Main_18_017,".....You are right."
CH7_Main_18_018,"The Sword is the best way to save this world, after all..."
CH7_Main_18_019,"It is smart to be wary of a power too strong to control."
CH7_Main_18_020,"However, do know that it is not an issue you can put off forever."
CH7_Main_19_001,"As expected of you, Gau. I have heard rumors of you, but your skills are truly impressive."
CH7_Main_19_002,"I wanted to meet you face to face, Tarkas."
CH7_Main_19_003,"Why...why did you start war with us?"
CH7_Main_19_004,"Because human greed will be the end of this world."
CH7_Main_19_005,"Barbarians were merely the beginning. We plan to wipe out the human race completely."
CH7_Main_19_006,"I won't let you!!"
CH7_Main_19_007,"Hah, that was a good fight. Still, this is the end - you were no match for me."
CH7_Main_19_008,"Now, die."
CH7_Main_19_009,"Gau!!"
CH7_Main_19_010,"Grrk....This...is the Holy Sword, Aea..."
CH7_Main_19_011,"So you are Kyle's son."
CH7_Main_19_012,"Yes. I am the son of your friend, Kyle - my name is Kasel."
CH7_Main_19_013,"I never thought I would meet the son of Kyle here. Interesting..."
CH7_Main_19_014,"I will see you later, son of Kyle."
CH7_Main_20_001,"Welcome, son of Kyle."
CH7_Main_20_002,"So you were waiting for us."
CH7_Main_20_003,"Yes. I cannot allow Aea to stay in human hands."
CH7_Main_20_004,"It is a dangerous weapon. Even more so, as it was given to greedy humans who cannot control themselves."
CH7_Main_20_005,"I will destroy everything. Humanity, and the Holy Sword as well!"
CH7_Main_20_006,"Why were you after Arlette?"
CH7_Main_20_007,"If you wish to know that, work with me and destroy them."
CH7_Main_20_008,"My curiosity is not worth such a price."
CH7_Main_20_009,"Hmph, you too were originally human."
CH7_Main_20_010,"Die together with your former race!"
CH7_Main_21_001,"The King of Frost Giants, Tarkas...as expected, he is really strong."
CH7_Main_21_002,"So weak, son of Kyle. You disappoint me."
CH7_Main_21_003,"This is the end!!"
CH7_Main_21_004,"I won't allow it, Tarkas!!"
CH7_Main_21_005,"Even if it wasn't what I wanted..."
CH7_Main_21_006,"If I falter here...I can't save everyone...I can't save the world!"
CH7_Main_21_007,"Even if I am swallowed by Darkness once more, there is no other way!"
CH7_Main_21_008,"Pavel, the time is now! Return the power of the Holy Sword to me!"
CH7_Main_21_009,"I see. As agreed, I return the power to its rightful owner."
CH7_Main_21_010,"I feel it...the holy power welling up inside the Sword..."
CH7_Main_21_011,"Gugh..."
CH7_Main_21_011_00,"So you were the inheritor of the Holy Sword..."
CH7_Main_21_012,"So this...is as far as I go..."
CH7_Main_21_013,"Lua...why did you give the Sword to the humans..."
CH7_Main_21_014,"So fragile...so weak...so unstable..."
CH7_Main_22_001,"Is it over..."
CH7_Main_22_002,"If you are speaking of Tarkas, I would say so."
CH7_Main_22_003,"Thank you, Pavel. We are all fine, thanks to you."
CH7_Main_22_004,"No, it is because you decided to do what must be done."
CH7_Main_22_005,"Gau, considering Tarkas has fallen, the remaining Barbarians must be safe, right?"
CH7_Main_22_006,"I'll still try to convince the other races, to make sure of things."
CH7_Main_22_007,"When you try to speak with the Harpies, tell them this."
CH7_Main_22_008,"The Harpies back in Elidora, to the southeast of this place"
CH7_Main_22_009,"also made a deal with Demons in the past, so they shouldn't be too harsh on you."
CH7_Main_22_010,"Haha, well, I'll see what I can do."
CH7_Main_22_011,"Now, only the power with in the talisman of Aeatola remains."
CH7_Main_22_012,"Then, the Holy Sword will be whole again."
CH7_Main_22_013,"Kasel, will you recover the last portion of power?"
CH7_Main_22_014,"Frey, you tried to do your part even through death."
CH7_Main_22_015,"I should...do what's right. Even if it scares me."
CH7_Main_22_016,"What's so scary? We're all here with you."
CH7_Main_22_017,"Thanks, Cleo."
CH7_Main_22_018,"I suggest heading to the Dragia Volcano first, before that."
CH7_Main_22_019,"Have you heard that the volcano has become more active recently?"
CH7_Main_22_020,"Yes."
CH7_Main_22_021,"It is probably due to a large Dimensional Rift occuring at the site."
CH7_Main_22_022,"A Dimensional Rift?"
CH7_Main_22_023,"Ever since the Dimensional Gate opened 100 years ago, small Rifts occured here and there."
CH7_Main_22_024,"Is..is that so? That's...that's really dangerous."
CH7_Main_22_025,"So far, only small Rifts occured...but this time, the scale is different."
CH7_Main_22_026,"Considering the volcanic activity has calmed down to a certain extent...you should be able to enter the area."
CH7_Main_22_027,"For protection, I will grant you a shield of protective Frost Magic."
CH7_Main_22_028,"After everything is over, I'll meet up with Lewisia and help you with your journey."
CH7_Main_22_029,"Thank you. We'll head over to Dragia first, then."
CH7_Lei_1_001,"Huh, why is a child just walking around here in the open?"
CH7_Lei_1_002,"Is there something wrong?"
CH7_Lei_1_003,"It's dangerous. The enemy is targeting all humans, remember?"
CH7_Lei_1_004,"I don't think she's particularly in danger."
CH7_Lei_1_005,"Well, she is young and alone...that could be dangerous potentially."
CH7_Lei_1_006,"Still, after Miruru and Rodina...I don't think she'd be in that much trouble."
CH7_Lei_1_007,"Hey, it's dangerous around here."
CH7_Lei_1_008,"Eh? You are..."
CH7_Lei_1_009,"Wait...have I seen you somewhere before?"
CH7_Lei_1_010,"It's been a while, Gau."
CH7_Lei_1_011,"You are...Lei?"
CH7_Lei_1_012,"Hmm, I guess they know each other."
CH7_Lei_1_013,"Considering you are here...has the orphanage shut down?"
CH7_Lei_1_014,"Irin is in charge of it."
CH7_Lei_1_015,"Wait...you haven't grown at all!"
CH7_Lei_1_016,"Indeed."
CH7_Lei_1_017,"I mean...considering the time that has passed, this is a bit..."
CH7_Lei_1_018,"Lei...was it? Are you also...cursed?"
CH7_Lei_1_019,"What do you mean, cursed?"
CH7_Lei_1_020,"Well, we met this kid in the Aegina Desert, named Miruru."
CH7_Lei_1_021,"She apparently was under a curse that turned her body into that of a child."
CH7_Lei_1_023,"Hahaha, no, it's not a curse."
CH7_Lei_1_024,"Hmm...Well, it does seem different."
CH7_Lei_1_025,"I swear Miruru's mind also reverted to that of a child, but...this..."
CH7_Lei_1_026,"Lei...was different from the other children. She was calm, more mature...so she stood out."
CH7_Lei_1_027,"I was worried, Lei. You left behind nothing but a letter."
CH7_Lei_1_028,"Well, it's a relief you're safe and sound."
CH7_Lei_1_029,"Uh, you mentioned an orphanage?"
CH7_Lei_1_030,"Gau built an orphanage for children orphaned from wars."
CH7_Lei_1_031,"He may look rough, but he's a caring man."
CH7_Lei_1_032,"War orphans..."
CH7_Lei_1_033,"Many children were orphaned in the war with the Frost Giants."
CH7_Lei_1_034,"I couldn't just leave them unattended."
CH7_Lei_1_035,"So you were away from the battlefield to tend to the children."
CH7_Lei_1_036,"But...perhaps that caused even more people to die..."
CH7_Lei_1_037,"That's not true, Gau."
CH7_Lei_1_038,"Even if you did fight on the front lines, nothing would have changed."
CH7_Lei_1_039,"I guess so, Lei. Thanks."
CH7_Lei_1_040,"It's dangerous here, so lets go."
CH7_Lei_1_041,"Haha, it's fine, Gau. I have some business to attend to."
CH7_Lei_1_042,"See you later, then."
CH7_Lei_1_043,"Lei!!"
CH7_Lei_1_044,"Oh, that stubborn child..."
CH7_Lei_1_045,"I don't think you need to worry that much, Gau."
CH7_Lei_1_046,"Considering her growth and all, I don't think she's a normal person."
CH7_Lei_2_001,"Lei?"
CH7_Lei_2_002,"Ah, the people from before."
CH7_Lei_2_003,"So you're with the Ice Dragon."
CH7_Lei_2_004,"Ice Dragon?"
CH7_Lei_2_005,"Who are you? I think I've seen you before..."
CH7_Lei_2_006,"Hm, I see. You wouldn't recognize this form, after all."
CH7_Lei_2_007,"Ice Dragon....I guess you're talking about Pavel?"
CH7_Lei_2_008,"Hmm...Ice Dragon, you haven't told them about your identity yet?"
CH7_Lei_2_009,"I only spoke about what was needed."
CH7_Lei_2_010,"It seems I am not the only one who hasn't revealed their identity, though."
CH7_Lei_2_011,"Haha, no need to be so wary."
CH7_Lei_2_012,"Still...we need to hurry."
CH7_Lei_2_013,"Gau can't beat Tarkas on his own."
CH7_Lei_2_014,"You even know Tarkas...who are you?"
CH7_Lei_2_015,"That can wait. For now, we must hurry."
CH7_Lei_2_016,"You will know in due time."
CH7_Lei_3_001,"No!!"
CH7_Lei_3_003,"Sorry, but I need to stop you there, Tarkas. He's a friend of mine, after all."
CH7_Lei_3_004,"You...Lewisia!!"
CH7_Lei_3_005,"Hmm, not bad."
CH7_Lei_3_006,"I was worried for a second about what would happen if I wasn't able to unlock my power."
CH7_Lei_3_007,"Hm, so it was Lewisia. No wonder I thought you looked familiar."
CH7_Lei_3_008,"Lewisia...wasn't that another of King Kyle's companions?"
CH7_Lei_3_009,"Yeah...the Vampire, Lewisia."
CH7_Lei_3_010,"How did you suddenly turn into an adult?"
CH7_Lei_3_011,"This is her true form. I am more curious about why she turned into a child."
CH7_Lei_3_012,"Lewisia, you..."
CH7_Lei_3_013,"I understand why you hate the humans, Tarkas..."
CH7_Lei_3_014,"But the world is in danger, and this is no time for you to vent upon the humans."
CH7_Lei_3_015,"You don't understand anything, Lewisia. Everything that went wrong is the humans' fault!!"
CH7_Lei_3_016,"And yet, it is also the humans that were tasked with ending the conflict."
CH7_Lei_3_017,"Lua decreed so, Tarkas."
CH7_Lei_3_018,"....Point taken."
CH7_Lei_3_019,"Still...."
CH7_Lei_3_020,"No, it can wait. I will retreat, for now."
CH7_Lei_4_001,"...Gau?"
CH7_Lei_4_002,"Ah...what...what is going on...."
CH7_Lei_4_003,"Are you really...Lei?"
CH7_Lei_4_004,"I was using a false name just in case of trouble."
CH7_Lei_4_005,"My real name is Lewisia."
CH7_Lei_4_006,"100 years ago, I used too much of my power. Now, I am limited to this childish form."
CH7_Lei_4_007,"I unlocked my power temporarily to save you,"
CH7_Lei_4_008,"but I will soon revert back into my younger form."
CH7_Lei_4_009,"....So you were a hero. A savior of this world."
CH7_Lei_4_010,"I didn't want people to know that, it would just be a bother."
CH7_Lei_4_011,"I just wanted to mingle normally with people."
CH7_Lei_4_012,"Why?"
CH7_Lei_4_013,"So you could...drink their blood?!"
CH7_Lei_4_014,"*Sigh*...Well, vampires don't only drink blood."
CH7_Lei_4_015,"It is true that blood makes us strong, but we do not thirst for it."
CH7_Lei_4_016,"Anyway, I only wished to observe the humans while wandering carefreely."
CH7_Lei_4_017,"I wanted to see them rebuilding this world after all that had occured."
CH7_Lei_4_018,"Apparently, though, those carefree times are now over."
CH7_Lei_4_019,"Is that not so, Child of the Holy Blade."
CH7_Lei_4_020,"I guess you would have known."
CH7_Lei_4_021,"Do you know who is leading the Demons this time?"
CH7_Lei_4_022,"No...but, we do have a lead."
CH7_Lei_4_023,"Apparently it's not a demon, nor is it a person of this world."
CH7_Lei_4_024,"Someone called the Black Knight."
CH7_Lei_4_025,"Yes. It seems that Tarkas is helping the Black Knight."
CH7_Lei_4_026,"What?! That means he's made a deal with the Demons!"
CH7_Lei_4_027,"What a hypocrite, blaming humans for everything while he's...!!"
CH7_Lei_4_028,"Although..."
CH7_Lei_4_029,"it seems the Demons are not involved whatsoever in this situation."
CH7_Lei_4_030,"It does seem that they have some internal...issues."
CH7_Lei_4_031,"Is that why he was after Arlette."
CH7_Lei_4_032,"Arlette? A human like her couldn't be alive after all this time..."
CH7_Lei_4_033,"Wait, Pavel. Did you do something?"
CH7_Lei_4_034,"I'll speak about that...later."
CH7_Lei_4_035,"I explained the whole thing to these people just a bit ago."
CH7_Lei_4_036,"So the fact that my mother was put into a cold sleep wasn't common knowledge between the heroes..."
CH7_Lei_4_037,"Hmm? She was your mother?"
CH7_Lei_4_038,"I see...so she really was alive."
CH7_Lei_4_039,"Not...anymore."
CH7_Lei_4_040,"Anyway, we need to stop Tarkas for now."
CH7_Lei_4_041,"It would be nice if everything could end after a nice conversation, but that doesn't seem possible."
CH7_Lei_4_042,"Well, it was always like this. Right, Frey?"
CH7_Lei_4_043,"Sadly, yes."
CH7_Lei_4_044,"I won't be of much help, anymore. My strength is all gone, and I will soon become a child again."
CH7_Lei_4_045,"I will need some time to recover, and then I'll join you all."
CH7_Lei_4_046,"After I do, I will need your help to return to my prime."
CH7_Lei_5_001,"So, you are here."
CH7_Lei_5_002,"I hear you're allied with the Black Knight."
CH7_Lei_5_003,"You know he's in charge of the Demons, right?"
CH7_Lei_5_004,"You know of him?"
CH7_Lei_5_005,"Not much?"
CH7_Lei_5_006,"All we know is that he's in charge of the Demons."
CH7_Lei_5_007,"And you have the gall to say that the humans are the cause of all this strife?!"
CH7_Lei_5_008,"Hmph, you know nothing."
CH7_Lei_5_009,"Now...die before you learn anything more."
CH7_Lei_5_010,"Let me ask one last thing before we fight."
CH1_TutorialR_1_001,"Not bad for a squire. Still, I can't help but notice..."
CH1_TutorialR_1_002,"Um, is something wrong?"
CH1_TutorialR_1_003,"Your sword. It's too worn out to use in battle."
CH1_TutorialR_1_004,"Oh, I... didn't realize that."
CH1_TutorialR_1_005,"I wonder if I can get a new one from the store."
CH1_TutorialR_1_006,"No need to go back. Just take mine."
CH1_TutorialR_1_007,"Thank you, but... I don't know how to use daggers."
CH1_TutorialR_1_008,"Tsk, tsk. Didn’t you know you could gain loots during the adventure?"
CH1_TutorialR_1_009,"Even if you don't need it, you can always sell it to make a few extra gold!"
CH1_TutorialR_1_010,"Cleo's right. Here, I think these swords might be useful to you."
CH1_TutorialR_2_001,"Wow, two swords? Thank you, Roi."
CH1_TutorialR_2_002,"It's not high in quality, but it'll do for now."
CH1_TutorialR_2_003,"Don't worry, we can always try enhancing them."
CH1_TutorialR_2_004,"At the forge? Guess we'd be going back to Orvel after all."
CH1_TutorialR_2_005,"Roi, you idiot!"
CH1_TutorialR_2_006,"I've heard of gear enhancement before."
CH1_TutorialR_2_007,"It's when priests upgrade gear using other gear as material, right?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_008,"That's correct."
CH1_TutorialR_2_009,"Ooh, I've always wanted to try that! Teach me how!"
CH1_TutorialR_2_010,"Um... this is a different kind of magic than the spells you usually use."
CH1_TutorialR_2_011,"Can you at least tell me how it works? Please?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_012,"It's my duty as the great sorcerous to at least learn the theory."
CH1_TutorialR_2_013,"Lua is the goddess of light and creator of all."
CH1_TutorialR_2_014,"Though creation is beyond our abilities..."
CH1_TutorialR_2_015,"As Lua's disciples, we are capable of merging gear with similar mana flows."
CH1_TutorialR_2_016,"Right, and gear used in battle usually have similar mana flow."
CH1_TutorialR_2_017,"But I've heard that there's a chance of failing if your stream of consciousness slips off."
CH1_TutorialR_2_018,"Don't worry. Even though I'm still an apprentice, I've never failed in gear enhancement."
CH1_TutorialR_2_019,"I guess becoming a priestess is my calling."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_001,"Oh, this is much better than the sword from before. Thank you so much, Roi."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_002,"Hahaha, you don't have to thank me for it."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_003,"It's not the best sword in the world. I'm actually worried that it's not high enough in terms of quality."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_004,"Don't worry, I can always enhance it."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_005,"I guess we should go to the Forge, after all."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_006,"No, you fool!"
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_007,"I heard there's a way we can enhance weapons without going to the Forge."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_008,"If I remember correctly, a priest can pray to the goddess and enhance weapons."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_009,"Yes, that's correct."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_010,"I've been curious about it for a long time now. What is the magical logic or principle behind Enhancement?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_011,"Um... It's very different from the spells you usually use..."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_012,"Can you at least tell me how the system works?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_013,"People call me an Archmage. It would be a shame if I didn't have any theoretical knowledge about it."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_014,"Lua is the goddess of light and creator of all."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_015,"Her servants, priests, and priestesses cannot create something out of nothing,"
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_016,"but they are able to bless objects with the power of Lua and imbue them with more strength."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_017,"It's a simple blessing, even for an apprentice priestess like myself."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_018,"It sounds both similar and different to alchemy."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_019,"Alchemy consumes plenty of materials, but it is for adding and changing attributes of an item rather than enhancing the item itself."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_020,"Do priests need any materials when performing Enhancement?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_021,"Oh, we don't, but we do need to offer Lua a certain amount of Gold."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_022,"According to the High Priest, that is how we express our gratitude to the goddess."
CH1_TutorialR_2_1_023,"...Umm, that sounds awfully practical and realistic."
CH1_TutorialR_3_001,"Participating in battle is really helping me with my combat skills."
CH1_TutorialR_3_002,"You shouldn't be neglecting your studies though."
CH1_TutorialR_3_003,"Ha ha, of course."
CH1_TutorialR_3_004,"I was planning on reading the warrior skill book to learn attributes just now."
CH1_TutorialR_4_001,"Hmm, I can't seem to find any useful loots around here."
CH1_TutorialR_4_002,"I know, right? All I found was this glittering rubbish."
CH1_TutorialR_4_003,"Oh, Cleo, that's...!!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_004,"Huh? Is something wrong, Frey?"
CH1_TutorialR_4_005,"That's a summoning stone!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_006,"With the help of Lua, we can summon powerful gear using that stone."
CH1_TutorialR_4_007,"I knew it! A great sorceress is bound to attract great items!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_008,"A great sorceress would probably recognize a summoning stone."
CH1_TutorialR_4_009,"Sh...shut up, Roi! You know this is the first time I've seen a summoning stone!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_010,"Cleo isn't a priestess, it's natural for her not to know."
CH1_TutorialR_4_011,"Since Cleo is the one who found the stone, I'll try to summon a wizard's gear."
CH1_TutorialR_5_001,"Welcome to May's General Shop!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_002,"We have weapon and armor that will suit a young, handsome knight!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_003,"Runes and magic powders are ready too, all just for you!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_004,"I hope you find what you need."
CH1_TutorialR_5_005,"But if you browse and leave without buying anything..."
CH1_TutorialR_5_006,"May will be very disappointed!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_007,"Heh. Looks like you have no choice, Mr. Young, Handsome Knight."
CH1_TutorialR_5_008,"Ahahaha..."
Tutorial0308_1_001,"Roi, is something wrong?"
Tutorial0308_1_002,"I don't understand."
Tutorial0308_1_003,"There are demons on the loose, but people only seem to care about the ancient royal vault."
Tutorial0308_1_004,"Maybe the Orvelian Royaty doesn't know about the demons yet?"
Tutorial0308_1_005,"Probably not. The expedition would have returned and reported about the demons by now."
Tutorial0308_1_006,"Yet the Royal Guard are digging for gold in such peace."
Tutorial0308_1_007,"Who cares! Thanks to the royal vault, our pockets will be filled with gold."
Tutorial0308_1_008,"I guess the kingdom needs supplies as well, especially at a time like this."
Tutorial0308_1_009,"Maybe so..."
Tutorial0308_1_010,"Well, it's not my place to intervene. This isn't even my country."
Tutorial0308_1_011,"Still... I can't help but wonder. Would we be able to defeat the demons without any help?"
Tutorial0308_1_012,"No worries! Cleo, the archmage will--"
Tutorial0308_1_013,"We can always ask for help elsewhere."
Tutorial0308_1_014,"Roi! Don't interrupt me! Focus on your job as my guard!"
Tutorial0308_1_015,"Interrupting unnecessary speech doesn't come in the way of my job."
Tutorial0308_1_016,"What did you say?! Why you..."
Tutorial0308_1_017,"Cleo, maybe we can let Roi finish?"
Tutorial0308_1_018,"H-huh? Um... sure, if you want."
Tutorial0308_1_019,"Thank you."
Tutorial0308_1_020,"I'm only letting you speak only because Frey wants to hear the rest!"
Tutorial0308_1_021,"I wasn't thanking you."
Tutorial0308_1_022,"Stop! Both of you!"
Tutorial0308_1_023,"Roi, who else can help us?"
Tutorial0308_1_024,"I wasn't referring to a specific person."
Tutorial0308_1_025,"Have you ever heard of something called 'Guild'?"
Tutorial0308_1_026,"It sounds familiar... I think it's what you call a group of people gathered with the same purpose."
Tutorial0308_1_027,"Correct."
Tutorial0308_1_028,"We might as well visit the Guild Center to check if they have any Mercenary Guilds."
Tutorial0308_1_029,"Oh! Mercenary Guild sounds like a great idea!"
Tutorial0308_1_030,"I've only heard about merchant guilds or production guilds."
Tutorial0308_1_031,"It's no wonder. We don't usually work with members of the guild."
Tutorial0308_1_032,"Do you know where the Guild Center is?"
Tutorial0308_1_033,"Of course. I haven't been there before, but It's very close."
Tutorial0308_2_001,"Excuse me."
Tutorial0308_2_002,"Welcome. Please state your purpose of visit."
Tutorial0308_2_003,"We'd like to get help from the Mercenary Guild!"
Tutorial0308_2_004,"Huh? Aren't you... Cleo?"
Tutorial0308_2_005,"Do I know you?"
Tutorial0308_2_006,"Of course. You've grown."
Tutorial0308_2_007,"How do you know Cleo?"
Tutorial0308_2_008,"Well, anyone who's ever stayed at the Tower of Sage must have heard about Cleo the troublemaker."
Tutorial0308_2_008_1,"I'm Veronica. I'm currently in charge of supplies in the Guild Center."
Tutorial0308_2_009,"Urg. You're from the Tower of Sages?"
Tutorial0308_2_010,"I have left the tower around... 5 years ago."
Tutorial0308_2_011,"Already gained fame as a troublemaker 5 years ago?"
Tutorial0308_2_012,"Forgive me for asking, but what is your name?"
Tutorial0308_2_013,"I'm Veronica, the Guild Center's Quartermaster."
Tutorial0308_2_014,"Let's stay in touch. I'd like to hear everything about Cleo's childhood."
Tutorial0308_2_015,"Shut up, Roi!"
Tutorial0308_2_016,"Why would someone from the Tower of Sage even be working at the Guild Center?"
Tutorial0308_2_017,"Well, everyone has their reasons, don't they?"
Tutorial0308_2_018,"I'm quite content with what I have now. I take great pride in what I'm doing."
Tutorial0308_2_019,"By the way, you're quite... different from how they described you at the Tower of Sage."
Tutorial0308_2_020,"Hmph! All those rumors are basically lies! They're just saying things because they're jealous of my amazing magic!"
Tutorial0308_2_021,"Well..."
Tutorial0308_2_022,"I don't think any of the wizards at the Tower of Sage I know would make up tall tales and spread them for fun."
Tutorial0308_2_023,"Maybe you've changed while we were apart, Cleo."
Tutorial0308_2_024,"I guess... that makes sense as well."
Tutorial0308_2_025,"Well, anyway, you said you needed help from the Mercenary Guild?"
Tutorial0308_2_026,"It seems you're all preparing for some adventure. Why don't you join a guild?"
Tutorial0308_2_027,"Or you can establish your own guild, too."
Tutorial0308_2_028,"Hiring mercenaries isn't a bad idea, "
Tutorial0308_2_029,"but joining a guild and taking on challenges with other guild members will give you a head start."
Tutorial0308_2_030,"The sorcerers from the Tower of the Sage don't usually spread groundless rumors..."
Tutorial0308_2_031,"Maybe you have changed since then, Cleo."
Tutorial0308_2_032,"......Maybe so."
Tutorial0308_2_033,"All jokes aside."
Tutorial0308_2_034,"I understand we can hire mercenaries here?"
Tutorial0308_2_035,"True, but I would like to suggest something else."
Tutorial0308_2_036,"How about joining a Guild?"
Tutorial0308_2_037,"Or you can always open a Guild yourself."
Tutorial0308_2_038,"Why would you suggest that?"
Tutorial0308_2_039,"It...It's just..."
Tutorial0308_2_040,"You seem to be hiding something from us."
Tutorial0308_2_041,"No, I--"
Tutorial0308_2_042,"Orvel keeps getting more and more suspicious."
Tutorial0308_2_043,"There seems to be a conspiracy going on..."
Tutorial0308_2_044,"It's a misunderstanding!"
Tutorial0308_2_045,"I just thought.... You guys seem very skilled, but also seem to be in need of money..."
Tutorial0308_2_046,"I'm... sorry if that sounded rude..."
Tutorial0308_2_047,"No it's... true."
Tutorial0308_2_048,"I don't know why you're looking for mercenaries"
Tutorial0308_2_049,"but joining a guild will definitely help you."
Tutorial0308_2_050,"Yes, you can always hire mercenaries, but becoming a member yourself..."
Tutorial0308_2_051,"It might bring you something much more valuable than gold..."
Tutorial0308_3_001,"It's been so long since our last visit to Orvel."
Tutorial0308_3_002,"Yes, we've been through much during our short adventure."
Tutorial0308_3_003,"I wonder what lays ahead of us."
Tutorial0308_3_004,"For now, let's forget everything and rest at the inn."
Tutorial0308_3_005,"Camping's great and all but... I miss sleeping in a bed!"
Tutorial0308_3_006,"I agree, we should rest while we can."
Tutorial0308_3_007,"Sounds good."
Tutorial0308_3_008,"I know a place for such occasion."
Tutorial0308_3_009,"You won't regret it."
Tutorial0308_4_001,"Can we stop by somewhere just near hear?"
Tutorial0308_4_002,"I'm sure it will be of help to you."
RaidTutorial_1_001,"Hello there! Are you here to slay the Flame Dragon? Do you mind if we join you?"
RaidTutorial_1_002,"Yanne~! Over here!"
RaidTutorial_1_003,"You seem way too excited, Mediana."
RaidTutorial_1_004,"Yes, this is my first dragon raid!"
RaidTutorial_1_005,"Better be careful. You can never be off guard when facing a dragon."
RaidTutorial_1_006,"But I'm with you, Yanne, why would I fear anything?"
RaidTutorial_1_007,"Oh, how rude of us not to introduce ourselves!"
RaidTutorial_1_008,"I'm Mediana."
RaidTutorial_1_009,"And this is the famous Dragon Slayer Yanne, slayer of the Mad Dragon Svelta!"
RaidTutorial_1_010,"Y..you're embarrassing me..."
RaidTutorial_1_011,"I'm just a simple monster hunter."
RaidTutorial_1_012,"I speak nothing but the truth, Yanne."
RaidTutorial_1_013,"Never mind her..."
RaidTutorial_1_014,"Should we go ahead?"
RaidTutorial_2_001,"Yanne! Our party members requested for a CC skill!"
RaidTutorial_2_002,"No problem, just concentrate and... attack!"
RaidTutorial_3_001,"Don't run away, Temeraire!"
RaidTutorial_3_002,"You're sick, you need my help!"
RaidTutorial_3_003,"It's no use."
RaidTutorial_3_004,"How would you cure a dragon driven mad by demons?"
RaidTutorial_3_005,"Mental illness is a form of sickness too."
RaidTutorial_3_006,"It can be cured with proper treatment and diagnoses. I will never give up!"
RaidTutorial_3_007,"Temeraire isn't mentally ill. 100 years ago, the Dark Lord's force--"
RaidTutorial_3_008,"That's not true."
RaidTutorial_3_009,"There's no such record that the Dark Lord made the dragons go mad using magic."
RaidTutorial_3_010,"Dragon's appearance might resemble that of mere reptiles, but they are beings of great intelligence."
RaidTutorial_3_011,"There must be an explanatory reason for their madness."
RaidTutorial_3_012,"Sure, sure, whatever you say."
RaidTutorial_3_013,"Careful, the hatchlings are approaching."
RaidTutorial_3_014,"Sweet babies, are you worried about your mama?"
RaidTutorial_3_015,"Don't be afraid, I'm here to cure her."
RaidTutorial_3_016,"Stop trying to tame them. The only way to get through is by defeating them!"
RaidTutorial_4_001,"You came back, Temeraire."
RaidTutorial_4_002,"Now, get ready for your treatment."
RaidTutorial_4_003,"Mediana, you shouldn't be diagnosing dragons with mental illness."
RaidTutorial_4_004,"...When you're the one that seems the most insane."
RaidTutorial_4_005,"I can proudly say that my mind is as healthy as anyone."
RaidTutorial_4_006,"And I never try out dangerous experiments on others."
RaidTutorial_4_007,"But... that dragon is a danger to everyone else, so..."
RaidTutorial_4_008,"Now, now Temeraire, don't be afraid~ Here comes the needle~!"
RaidTutorial_4_009,"Who should cure who..."
RaidTutorial_5_001,"Good work, everyone."
RaidTutorial_5_002,"Since this is your first battle against dragons, you can keep the loots."
RaidTutorial_5_003,"Is that all right with you, Mediana?"
RaidTutorial_5_004,"...Mediana?"
RaidTutorial_5_005,"Now there, Temeraire, don't worry."
RaidTutorial_5_006,"You will get the treatment you need."
RaidTutorial_5_007,"Though my cure may be a little rough..."
RaidTutorial_5_008,"It's all for your own good."
RaidTutorial_5_009,"Don't be afraid of my needle~!"
RaidTutorial_5_010,"I wonder what would happen if a fire dragon is injected with a fiery shot?"
RaidTutorial_5_011,"Fufufu... How interesting..."
RaidTutorial_5_012,"Ha..haha.. Um... I guess Mediana isn't interested..."
RaidTutorial_5_013,"So... take whatever you want."
RaidTutorial_5_014,"It was a pleasure to meet you."
RaidTutorial_6_001,"Humph, I did tell you that I can sharpen a blade fatal enough to catch a dragon..."
RaidTutorial_6_002,"But I'd never have guessed you'd actually go and hunt them down."
RaidTutorial_6_003,"I guess I can't call you newbies anymore."
RaidTutorial_6_004,"Judging by the loots you brought... Was it Temeraire?"
RaidTutorial_6_005,"Come by the forge again when you gather enough coins."
RaidTutorial_6_006,"I have some dragon gear lying around..."
RaidTutorial_6_007,"You can pay for them with the dragon's coins."
CONVERSATION_TU_49,"Hah, another fool with no sense of fear."
CONVERSATION_TU_50,"What is this place?"
CONVERSATION_TU_51,"This is where they locked away the evil creatures they captured during the past war."
CONVERSATION_TU_52,"Rumor has it that some of the creatures were used as subjects for forbidden experiments."
CONVERSATION_TU_53,"Yes, this is a prison."
CONVERSATION_TU_54,"It's literally hell down there, but I won't stop you if you dare to enter."
CONVERSATION_TU_55,"Best of luck."
CONVERSATION_TU_56,"Hey! You guys look pretty tough."
CONVERSATION_TU_57,"Are you talking about us?"
CONVERSATION_TU_58,"Would you be interested in a match?"
CONVERSATION_TU_59,"This place is full of contestants that put their lives on the line for honor!"
CONVERSATION_TU_60,"It's the perfect place for the likes of you!"
CONVERSATION_TU_80,"Materials... I need more materials!"
CONVERSATION_TU_81,"Bring me more money and materials, greenhorn!"
CONVERSATION_TU_82,"Who are you calling a greenhorn!"
CONVERSATION_TU_83,"Humph. Are you going adventuring with that kind of equipment?"
CONVERSATION_TU_84,"Your weapons are so dull, they can barely cut butter."
CONVERSATION_TU_85,"I'll fix them up sharp enough to cut through a dragon's scales."
CONVERSATION_TU_86,"That is, if you have enough gold and materials!"
CONVERSATION_TU_249,"Welcome to Hero's Inn!"
CONVERSATION_TU_250,"Ha ha! This house is full of heroes today."
CONVERSATION_TU_251,"Oh, Kasel! It's been a long time!"
CONVERSATION_TU_252,"For some reason, it feels like there are a lot of newcomers."
CONVERSATION_TU_253,"You will find a lot of adventurers these days because there are more demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_254,"They come looking for companions and end up staying a few days."
CONVERSATION_TU_255,"If you are also looking for companions, Kasel, do you want to meet them?"
CH8_Main_0_001,"It's so hot, even though Pavel cast Frost on us."
CH8_Main_0_002,"I think it got even hotter when we were going through Windland Snow Mountain."
CH8_Main_0_003,"Really? Why can't I feel anything?"
CH8_Main_0_004,"Probably because you're immune to heat."
CH8_Main_0_005,"Frey, do you think you can block the heat with your shield?"
CH8_Main_0_006,"I can block damage, but not heat... Sorry."
CH8_Main_0_007,"But there's a bigger problem... I feel a powerful evil energy from far away... "
CH8_Main_0_008,"Massive dark power is gathered at the top of the volcano."
CH8_Main_0_009,"So, there really is something wrong with the Dragia Volcano."
CH8_Main_0_010,"But didn't the Mad Dragon Temeraire build its lair on Dragia Volcano?"
CH8_Main_0_011,"No one would even dare go near that place. Unless it's someone completely stupid."
CH8_Main_0_012,"The Mad Dragon Temeraire?"
CH8_Main_0_013,"I think I heard about it back at the Tower of Sage."
CH8_Main_0_014,"If my memory is correct... Isn't it the ancient Red Dragon?"
CH8_Main_0_015,"Well, it's just a mad dragon now."
CH8_Main_0_016,"There's a rumor that a hundred years ago, the Demons did something to it that drove the dragon into insanity."
CH8_Main_0_017,"I don't know all the details..."
CH8_Main_0_018,"Anyway, that's not the point here."
CH8_Main_0_019,"The real problem is that there's someone crazy enough to inject evil energy into the mad dragon's lair."
CH8_Main_0_020,"Things are starting to get out of hand."
CH8_Main_0_021,"Creating a dimensional rift in such place..."
CH8_Main_0_022,"What could the Demons be up to?"
CH8_Main_0_023,"We need to find out what's going on."
CH8_Main_0_024,"We may not be able to figure this out now, but we can get some information... Hm?"
CH8_Main_0_025,"Why is the Holy Sword...?"
CH8_Main_0_026,"Kuh...!"
CH8_Main_0_027,"Kasel! What's wrong?"
CH8_Main_0_028,"Ugh... Yea. I'm okay, Frey."
CH8_Main_0_029,"I'm not sure why..."
CH8_Main_0_030,"But the Holy Sword is reacting to something."
CH8_Main_0_031,"The last power's fragment would be the only thing that would make the Holy Sword react like this."
CH8_Main_0_032,"Isn't Kaulah storing the last fragment of the Holy Sword's power?"
CH8_Main_0_033,"Anyway. Nothing will get done if we just stay here."
CH8_Main_0_034,"Let's head to the volcano."
CH8_Main_0_035,"At the very least, we should be able to learn something new."
CH8_Main_1_001,"We can't get to the volcano from here."
CH8_Main_1_002,"Yes, there is a river of lava trickling from the volcano..."
CH8_Main_1_003,"Pavel's frost won't be enough to protect us."
CH8_Main_1_004,"Maybe we can try to fly over it on my staff."
CH8_Main_1_005,"We'd need some high flying magic that can last a long time, though,"
CH8_Main_1_006,"It's just too dangerous to cross it with common flying magic."
CH8_Main_1_007,"Of course, it would be okay if Cleo went alone since she can withstand the fire."
CH8_Main_1_008,"Hm... What now?"
CH8_Main_1_009,"Should we go back to Windland and ask for Pavel's help?"
CH8_Main_1_010,"For now, let's go to the northwest since that path seems clear enough."
CH8_Main_1_011,"I'm not sure what we'll do if the lava blocks our way again..."
CH8_Main_2_001,"What's wrong?"
CH8_Main_2_002,"New intruders."
CH8_Main_2_003,"Four humans, including the wielder of the Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_2_004,"Hmph. I guess Malduk mentioned that one earlier."
CH8_Main_2_005,"Alright. Send a unit."
CH8_Main_2_006,"It should be okay to kill them all."
CH8_Main_2_007,"Understood."
CH8_Main_2_008,"Wait. What about the other intruders?"
CH8_Main_2_009,"Dragon's scent detected. Pursuing unit formed."
CH8_Main_2_010,"Falsified traces... Dwarf trap activated."
CH8_Main_2_011,"Draconics, two injured, one dead."
CH8_Main_2_012,"Still in pursuit."
CH8_Main_2_013,"Bah. Weaklings... They're resorting to some annoying tricks."
CH8_Main_2_014,"Alright. I can kill them anytime."
CH8_Main_2_015,"Just bring the dragon to me."
CH8_Main_2_016,"A dragon in one piece. I won't kill it quickly, you know."
CH8_Main_2_017,"I'm excited, hahahaha... Bwahahaha!"
CH8_Main_2_018,"Hmph. You seriously can't give up that bad habit of playing with your prey before killing it."
CH8_Main_2_019,"You and that Kallax..."
CH8_Main_2_020,"Tsk, Morrah..."
CH8_Main_2_021,"It's been a while. So, how is it working for a lowly human?"
CH8_Main_2_022,"..."
CH8_Main_2_023,"!!!"
CH8_Main_2_024,"If you insult Maria in front of me again..."
CH8_Main_2_025,"I'll lop off your head."
CH8_Main_2_026,"Hmph. I'd like to see you try."
CH8_Main_2_027,"You haven't been our leader for a long time, Morrah."
CH8_Main_2_028,"You're the still same after a hundred years. We've grown stronger."
CH8_Main_2_029,"All this time, we've been hunting and eating dragons."
CH8_Main_2_030,"Hmph. Know your place, Infira."
CH8_Main_2_031,"Your body has changed because of the souls of the dragons you ate. You're still just small fry."
CH8_Main_2_032,"If you don't want to be called that, try absorbing at least one soul from an ancient dragon."
CH8_Main_2_033,"Bwahahaha, you're saying I can't handle the soul of an ancient dragon?"
CH8_Main_2_034,"Alright, I'll prove it."
CH8_Main_2_035,"The prey this time is the Blue Dragon that was once worshiped as the God Dragon."
CH8_Main_2_036,"It's a big shot amongst the dragons that oversee the world."
CH8_Main_2_037,"I'd like to see you try, just like you said."
CH8_Main_2_038,"Well, it doesn't matter. I'll just do what I'm told."
CH8_Main_2_039,"Whatever you do, if it doesn't affect my mission, I have no reason to intervene."
CH8_Main_2_040,"I forgot to ask."
CH8_Main_2_041,"What brings you here?"
CH8_Main_2_042,"You ask the obvious."
CH8_Main_2_043,"The dimensional rifts disappeared in the places they've passed by."
CH8_Main_2_044,"Maria was worried that it would cause problems to his plan."
CH8_Main_2_045,"That's why she sent me here. It's the biggest and most important dimensional rift."
CH8_Main_2_046,"Hmph. Even the ancient Fire Dragon Temeraire is in my hands now."
CH8_Main_2_047,"He gave me this power of erosion that can even control dragons' minds."
CH8_Main_2_048,"With this, even the Dragia Volcano is impregnable!"
CH8_Main_2_049,"Heh. You mean the one that turned into Mad Dragon a hundred years ago?"
CH8_Main_2_050,"What's the point of controlling a mindless beast like that?"
CH8_Main_2_051,"It doesn't matter, so long as you can control its power."
CH8_Main_2_052,"Tsk. Let's see how long you can keep talking big like that, Morrah."
CH8_Main_2_053,"Just watch. Once this mission is over, I'll show who is the strongest."
CH8_Main_2_054,"That's only if you complete your mission."
CH8_Main_2_055,"Don't underestimate the wielder of the Holy Sword, Infira."
CH8_Main_2_056,"We don't know what might happen to this place."
CH8_Main_2_057,"Hmph. Just don't get in the way, Morrah."
CH8_Main_2_058,"I don't need your help."
CH8_Main_2_059,"Heh. Good to hear."
CH8_Main_2_060,"I wouldn't help you, anyway, even if you got on your knees and begged."
CH8_Main_2_061,"Just remember this. If you get in my way, or this job goes wrong..."
CH8_Main_2_062,"I'm taking your head."
CH8_Main_3_001,"...!? What's this energy?"
CH8_Main_3_002,"This incredible mana... What's going on...?"
CH8_Main_3_003,"A demon with the power of fire!?"
CH8_Main_3_004,"This is... Morrah! It's similar to Morrah's energy!"
CH8_Main_3_005,"Kuh, the killing intent itself is so intense...!"
CH8_Main_3_006,"Everyone, be careful!"
CH8_Main_3_007,"Hmph, I'll show you the power of an Archmage!"
CH8_Main_3_008,"...?!"
CH8_Main_3_009,"My fire magic isn't working...?"
CH8_Main_3_010,"This happened when we fought Morrah as well..."
CH8_Main_3_011,"In that case...!"
CH8_Main_3_012,"Kasel, don't push yourself too far!"
CH8_Main_3_013,"Whew... whew... Alright!"
CH8_Main_3_014,"It's okay, Frey. I'm used to this power now!"
CH8_Main_3_015,"Alright, here I go, Demon!"
CH8_Main_4_001,"Grrr, kugh..."
CH8_Main_4_002,"Haaaa!!"
CH8_Main_4_003,"Tsk!"
CH8_Main_4_004,"You think I'll lose you!"
CH8_Main_4_005,"...!"
CH8_Main_4_006,"In the name of the Goddess...!"
CH8_Main_4_007,"Haaa!"
CH8_Main_4_008,"Tsk, was it too low...? I just missed the vital point..."
CH8_Main_4_009,"Kuh!"
CH8_Main_4_010,"Roi!!"
CH8_Main_4_011,"Go, Fire Ball!"
CH8_Main_4_012,"Ugh, my fire magic isn't working...!"
CH8_Main_4_013,"Aaaaaah!"
CH8_Main_4_014,"No, Frey!!!"
CH8_Main_4_015,"Aaaaaah!!"
CH8_Main_4_016,"Kuh, haaaa!!"
CH8_Main_4_017,"Roi!!"
CH8_Main_4_018,"Kuh, damn it!"
CH8_Main_4_019,"Move back, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_4_020,"Kuh, he keeps dodging...!"
CH8_Main_4_021,"Is he not fighting head-on because he knows it's the Holy Sword...!?"
CH8_Main_4_022,"!!!!"
CH8_Main_4_023,"Everyone, dodge!"
CH8_Main_4_024,"No, there's no need."
CH8_Main_4_025,"Thank you, Yanne."
CH8_Main_4_026,"Stand up, everyone."
CH8_Main_4_027,"Hm...?"
CH8_Main_4_028,"Frey! Are you okay!?"
CH8_Main_4_029,"Yes. Yes. I'm okay. I can get up."
CH8_Main_4_030,"Bwahahaha, it's been a while, everyone!"
CH8_Main_4_031,"Phillop!?"
CH8_Main_4_032,"Save the talk for later! We need to get rid of the remaining Draconics!"
CH8_Main_4_033,"Oh, don't worry! I beat them all up a little earlier!"
CH8_Main_4_034,"Alright, I'll show you how to hunt Draconics!"
CH8_Main_4_035,"Okay!"
CH8_Main_5_001,"*Huff...* We defeated them all somehow..."
CH8_Main_5_002,"Thank you so much. If you hadn't helped us..."
CH8_Main_5_003,"Hahaha. Anyone would've done what I did in that situation."
CH8_Main_5_004,"Anyway. You've all grown strong."
CH8_Main_5_005,"Did you retrieve the power of the Holy Sword that the Barbarians had?"
CH8_Main_5_006,"Yes. A wizard named Pavel had it."
CH8_Main_5_007,"By the way, you two were comrades a hundred years ago, right?"
CH8_Main_5_008,"Ah, yes, Pavel. That's who you meant."
CH8_Main_5_009,"He was always pretty quiet, so we didn't get to talk much."
CH8_Main_5_010,"His frost magic was truly awesome, though."
CH8_Main_5_011,"Hahaha, I guess he always was the silent type."
CH8_Main_5_012,"Oh, that reminds me..."
CH8_Main_5_013,"I still haven't said hello to the others behind you."
CH8_Main_5_014,"I'm Kasel. And these are Frey, Cleo, and Roi."
CH8_Main_5_015,"Thank you for helping us."
CH8_Main_5_016,"Like Phillop said, we just did what we had to do. Don't worry about it."
CH8_Main_5_017,"I'm Yanne, a Barbarian hunter. You could say I'm just an ordinary monster hunter."
CH8_Main_5_018,"Hm? Barbarian..."
CH8_Main_5_019,"I'm the Priestess of Water, Laias."
CH8_Main_5_020,"I came from the Shrine of Flow that is under the oasis in Aegina Desert."
CH8_Main_5_021,"Hm? Laias... That Laias!?"
CH8_Main_5_022,"That legendary Blue Dragon worshiped as the God Dragon in the desert country!?"
CH8_Main_5_023,"Oh? There are still people around who know that story?"
CH8_Main_5_024,"I'm flattered... It wasn't really a huge deal."
CH8_Main_5_025,"I just called the rain and made the lands fertile sometimes..."
CH8_Main_5_026,"Other than that..."
CH8_Main_5_027,"Ha ha, you are so humble."
CH8_Main_5_028,"If it weren't for you, Aegina Desert would've been a wasteland forever."
CH8_Main_5_029,"And Yanne, didn't you beat up a Mad Dragon by yourself a few years ago?"
CH8_Main_5_030,"Ah, Mad Dragon Svelta. It was an aloof and prideful dragon in the past."
CH8_Main_5_031,"Although it became a Mad Dragon a hundred years ago because of the Demons..."
CH8_Main_5_032,"His soul was distorted with anger and pain."
CH8_Main_5_033,"It was you who helped him go back into the flow of the world."
CH8_Main_5_034,"If you could please not mention that... hahaha..."
CH8_Main_5_035,"I only helped because people just asked me for help..."
CH8_Main_5_036,"And talking about that with another dragon present is..."
CH8_Main_5_037,"I'm sorry for interrupting, but..."
CH8_Main_5_038,"May I ask what brings you to Dragia...?"
CH8_Main_5_039,"You don't have to be so polite, Child of Fire."
CH8_Main_5_040,"Let's say... We're here because of the large Demon army that attacked the Aegina Desert."
CH8_Main_5_041,"I was cleaning up the remnants of the Undead,"
CH8_Main_5_042,"when a bunch of Demons came from the Dragia Volcano."
CH8_Main_5_043,"There wasn't much going on in the volcano when I was leaving..."
CH8_Main_5_044,"Then, the dimensional rift in the volcano must have appeared recently."
CH8_Main_5_045,"That's when the Demon army started coming over..."
CH8_Main_5_046,"Yes. They even reached the oasis."
CH8_Main_5_047,"With the Draconics that were made to hunt other dragons at the forefront..."
CH8_Main_5_048,"My younger brother sensed their threat, so he woke me up from my 100-year sleep."
CH8_Main_5_049,"And then, with the help of Phillop, we were able to push back the Demons to the border of Aegina."
CH8_Main_5_050,"I've fought many Draconics in the past."
CH8_Main_5_051,"I know how they fight and the kinds of strategies they like to use."
CH8_Main_5_052,"But when we were about to leave to Dragia to find out the cause, I saw it."
CH8_Main_5_053,"The ancient Fire Dragon Temeraire was causing a ruckus in Aegina, controlled by Draconics..."
CH8_Main_5_054,"We barely stopped him, but he flew in the direction of Dragia."
CH8_Main_5_055,"That's why before coming to Dragia, I asked Yanne for help since she has experience fighting a Mad Dragon."
CH8_Main_5_056,"I have many acquaintances around here since I hunt monsters,"
CH8_Main_5_057,"so I heard about it through the Hunter's Guild."
CH8_Main_5_058,"I had just finished hunting a giant scorpion, so I joined right away."
CH8_Main_5_059,"I see... So that's what happened."
CH8_Main_5_060,"I thought Aegina Desert would be fine since there aren't many Undeads there..."
CH8_Main_5_061,"In order to protect Aegina from the threat of the Demons,"
CH8_Main_5_062,"we'll have to get rid of the dimensional rift in Dragia."
CH8_Main_6_001,"By the way, I guess it was true that dragons fall asleep for a long time!"
CH8_Main_6_002,"Hm? But wait..."
CH8_Main_6_003,"If you were asleep for 100 years... Were you with the Warrior of the Holy Sword during the Demon War?"
CH8_Main_6_004,"Ha ha, I'm sorry, but I wasn't part of them."
CH8_Main_6_005,"Protecting the children of the desert was my priority..."
CH8_Main_6_006,"Oh, right. Phillop was the first member I met from the Warrior's party."
CH8_Main_6_007,"Ha ha, I always knew Dwarves were honest, reliable, and trustworthy."
CH8_Main_6_008,"Ahem... Priestess, you flatter me too much."
CH8_Main_6_009,"Why is everyone looking at me like that? It's too much."
CH8_Main_6_010,"Tarkas did a lot more than me!"
CH8_Main_6_011,"By the way, didn't you go to Windland?"
CH8_Main_6_012,"You met Tarkas, right? How is he doing?"
CH8_Main_6_013,"..."
CH8_Main_6_014,"..."
CH8_Main_6_015,"Hm? Why are you making that face?"
CH8_Main_6_016,"After Musuclow died, Tarkas declared war on the Barbarian Kingdom."
CH8_Main_6_017,"He rallied the other races of Windland, and started killing the Barbarians."
CH8_Main_6_018,"...?!"
CH8_Main_6_019,"What? How did that happen?"
CH8_Main_6_020,"He said that the humans and their ambition... make the world dangerous."
CH8_Main_6_021,"He declared that he would destroy the Holy Sword, mankind, everything..."
CH8_Main_6_022,"He tried to kill us, too."
CH8_Main_6_023,"In the end, I unlocked the power of the Holy Sword... and slashed him down."
CH8_Main_6_024,"He was so close to Kyle..."
CH8_Main_6_025,"Tarkas... Why...?"
CH8_Main_6_026,"Phillop couldn't have known that. But Yanne, you don't look so surprised."
CH8_Main_6_027,"I heard the news... a while back."
CH8_Main_6_028,"I was in search of work wandering the continent, so I was lucky."
CH8_Main_6_029,"It's lamentable what happened to my people... But it's not like there's no hope."
CH8_Main_6_030,"Even if the kingdom is gone, not all the Barbarians were killed."
CH8_Main_6_031,"Right now, they are led by the chief warrior Gau, signing peace agreements with the other races. They're barely keeping the peace."
CH8_Main_6_032,"They'll have another king later, but first, they have to focus on survival and rebuild."
CH8_Main_6_033,"That's something, at least. Gau is alive and well..."
CH8_Main_6_034,"So did Tarkas cooperate with the Black Knight or not?"
CH8_Main_6_035,"According to the information from Lewisia, that's still unconfirmed..."
CH8_Main_6_036,"Tarkas didn't explain anything until the end."
CH8_Main_6_037,"You've already met Lewisia, the Vampire Princess. Hm..."
CH8_Main_6_038,"It doesn't make sense for Tarkas to cooperate with the Demons so easily."
CH8_Main_6_039,"He had great pride as a warrior. I can't believe he would have just succumbed to the Demons."
CH8_Main_6_040,"I'm sure he had a reason."
CH8_Main_6_041,"I believe I said this earlier, but..."
CH8_Main_6_042,"Nothing will get solved by us just standing here."
CH8_Main_6_043,"We just need to do what we can."
CH8_Main_6_044,"Then let's move to the west, where the Draconics aren't doing much."
CH8_Main_6_045,"It will be the long way, but it will be safer."
CH8_Main_7_001,"So there are turtles and Muhrooms in the volcano, too."
CH8_Main_7_002,"They can actually live in such a hot place..."
CH8_Main_7_003,"Can we grill them?"
CH8_Main_7_004,"Hm? Is it that hot?"
CH8_Main_7_005,"It doesn't feel hot to me..."
CH8_Main_7_006,"Phillop is a Dwarf, and Laias is a dragon, so I understand,"
CH8_Main_7_007,"but how are you able to deal with this heat, Yanne?"
CH8_Main_7_008,"You have resistance to fire like me?"
CH8_Main_7_009,"I'm not sure,"
CH8_Main_7_010,"but I got covered in Svelta's blood when I hunted it."
CH8_Main_7_011,"Hm... Or it might have something to do with the dragon meat I ate after that?"
CH8_Main_7_012,"Dragon meat...?"
CH8_Main_7_013,"I shared the dragon's scales, bones, and useful parts with the residents"
CH8_Main_7_014,"to help them rebuild the village that Svelta had destroyed."
CH8_Main_7_015,"But then, so many of the people were starving."
CH8_Main_7_016,"So I cut out Svelta's meat to share with them, and I ate some myself."
CH8_Main_7_017,"Ever since that, I've never gotten ill, and I don't get hurt as much."
CH8_Main_7_018,"A dragon's body is imbued with the power of nature, so it can be a powerful magic catalyst."
CH8_Main_7_019,"In the past, there were people who wanted to hunt dragons for that reason... but no one survived."
CH8_Main_7_020,"If you had eaten the dragon for your own selfish interests, I would be angry."
CH8_Main_7_021,"It's clear that your intentions were good, though, so I'd like to praise you, Yanne."
CH8_Main_7_022,"I'm sure Svelta would have been relieved to know that he was"
CH8_Main_7_023,"useful to the earthly beings before leaving."
CH8_Main_7_024,"Hmm... I see."
CH8_Main_7_025,"Anyway, talking about food makes me hungry."
CH8_Main_7_026,"If there's not enough food, how about monster meat?"
CH8_Main_7_027,"It's pretty good!"
CH8_Main_7_028,"...!!"
CH8_Main_7_029,"What about Bloodsucking Spider legs...?"
CH8_Main_7_030,"I've tried it. It's so chewy and good."
CH8_Main_7_031,"Well, what about Muhrooms...?"
CH8_Main_7_032,"Muhrooms are good when grilled. Just like meat."
CH8_Main_7_033,"Maybe it's because they're mushroom monsters?"
CH8_Main_7_034,"..."
CH8_Main_7_035,"..."
CH8_Main_7_036,"Hah..."
CH8_Main_8_001,"Hm. Another lava river."
CH8_Main_8_002,"I don't see a way around it..."
CH8_Main_8_003,"There's nothing to worry about."
CH8_Main_8_004,"We have a dragon!"
CH8_Main_8_005,"We'll be fine if we fly over it!"
CH8_Main_8_006,"Well... This morphed form suppresses some of my powers."
CH8_Main_8_007,"If I go back to my dragon form, all my power will be unlocked."
CH8_Main_8_008,"Then, all the Draconics in this area will react to that power and go berserk."
CH8_Main_8_009,"I don't think we can deal with both Temeraire and that large army of Draconics."
CH8_Main_8_010,"Hm... That would definitely be dangerous."
CH8_Main_8_011,"Do Draconics always go berserk when they only react to the power of dragons?"
CH8_Main_8_012,"I'm not sure about that... But they don't go berserk when I'm in my morphed form."
CH8_Main_8_013,"I'm not sure if they don't feel the need to go berserk when my powers are hidden, or they just don't..."
CH8_Main_8_014,"Hm. So, that's why you're in that form..."
CH8_Main_8_015,"Then how do we cross the lava river?"
CH8_Main_8_016,"It's not like there's no way in this form."
CH8_Main_8_017,"It can be a little dangerous, so I'll create a shield."
CH8_Main_8_018,"Embrace -"
CH8_Main_8_019,"This is... a water shield?"
CH8_Main_8_020,"It's different from Frey's holy shield."
CH8_Main_8_021,"You better cover your ears."
CH8_Main_8_022,"Well, you'll get used to it after a few times."
CH8_Main_8_023,"???"
CH8_Main_8_024,"Overflow -"
CH8_Main_8_025,"..."
CH8_Main_8_026,"The waterfall is going into the lava..."
CH8_Main_8_027,"Wow, look at all that vapor...!"
CH8_Main_8_028,"If it wasn't for the shield, we would've been burned..."
CH8_Main_8_029,"I can just harden the lava temporarily, without the need to fly over, right?"
CH8_Main_8_030,"Ha ha, it will start flowing again after some time."
CH8_Main_8_031,"Oh, the heat will be dispersed by the Bubble Shield, so it should be fine."
CH8_Main_8_032,"I... didn't think of this."
CH8_Main_8_033,"As expected of a dragon!"
CH8_Main_8_034,"Well, water is the specialty of the Blue Dragon."
CH8_Main_8_035,"Ha ha, shall we get going then?"
CH8_Main_9_001,"Now that we crossed the lava river..."
CH8_Main_9_002,"Let's talk about what we should do next."
CH8_Main_9_003,"First, we need to take care of the mind control on Temeraire."
CH8_Main_9_004,"As long as he's there, we cannot enter the Dragia Volcano."
CH8_Main_9_005,"Fighting strong Demons and the ancient Red Dragon at the same time..."
CH8_Main_9_006,"I don't even want to think about it."
CH8_Main_9_007,"That's why we better separate the Draconics and Temeraire first."
CH8_Main_9_008,"After that, we can remove the control over Temeraire's mind, or at least seal his movements."
CH8_Main_9_009,"That's why we got away from where the Draconics are."
CH8_Main_9_010,"Hahaha, we scouted this area out a few days ago."
CH8_Main_9_011,"There aren't many Draconics to the northwest of here."
CH8_Main_9_012,"We saw some scouts coming, but they're just flying around."
CH8_Main_9_013,"There are also monsters scattered around the volcano, but that's no problem."
CH8_Main_9_014,"There are a few hidden caves to the northwest of here that lead to the Dwarven Kingdom."
CH8_Main_9_015,"The Dwarves have set a lot of traps around there to protect the land."
CH8_Main_9_016,"Even Draconics won't be able to access it easily."
CH8_Main_9_017,"Draconics are Demons that were made to hunt dragons."
CH8_Main_9_018,"If they find out my location, they'll come and hunt me down."
CH8_Main_9_019,"But if it's an area dangerous for them..."
CH8_Main_9_020,"They will choose the most efficient way."
CH8_Main_9_021,"They will use Temeraire, since traps won't work on him."
CH8_Main_9_022,"I get it. You want to use their own strategy against them."
CH8_Main_9_023,"I like that plan."
CH8_Main_9_024,"But I have two questions before that..."
CH8_Main_9_025,"What's the chance that the Draconics and Temeraire will attack together?"
CH8_Main_9_026,"Very low."
CH8_Main_9_027,"Temeraire is a Mad Dragon. He doesn't care what's around him and just uses his full power."
CH8_Main_9_028,"Even the powerful Draconics will be danger if they get caught in battle around him repeatedly."
CH8_Main_9_029,"Hm, understood."
CH8_Main_9_030,"Then, my next question."
CH8_Main_9_031,"Do we have a plan if Temeraire comes here?"
CH8_Main_9_032,"While we take care of Temeraire,"
CH8_Main_9_033,"Yanne will shoot an arrow with a purging spell at Temeraire's head."
CH8_Main_9_034,"That should remove the mind control on Temeraire, forcing him to sleep."
CH8_Main_9_035,"Hm..."
CH8_Main_9_036,"What if that fails?"
CH8_Main_9_037,"Then... We'll have to defeat Temeraire with force."
CH8_Main_9_038,"I don't want to hurt my old friend anymore..."
CH8_Main_9_039,"But I'll do it if it comes to that."
CH8_Main_10_001,"Enemy... Found."
CH8_Main_10_002,"Kill them all, except for the dragon."
CH8_Main_10_003,"Die...!!!"
CH8_Main_10_004,"Ha ha."
CH8_Main_10_005,"I'd like to see you try, you wannabe dragons."
CH8_Main_10_006,"In the name of Laias, the water of life, and the adjuster of the flow of the world..."
CH8_Main_10_007,"I'll annihilate you."
CH8_Main_11_001,"Kuh...!"
CH8_Main_11_002,"Serious injuries... Retreat!!!"
CH8_Main_11_003,"We better report to Infira..."
CH8_Main_11_004,"The bait has been set."
CH8_Main_11_005,"Now we just need to wait for Temeraire to come here."
CH8_Main_11_006,"If their leader is Infira... I think we'll succeed."
CH8_Main_11_007,"If he's anything like before, he'll let his impatience get the best of him."
CH8_Main_11_008,"Infira... Who is that?"
CH8_Main_11_009,"I don't think his name was mentioned in any of the books I've read in the Tower of Sage."
CH8_Main_11_010,"Infira is one of the commanders of the Draconics."
CH8_Main_11_011,"He's a wizard that uses the fire of hell, and he's very powerful."
CH8_Main_11_012,"He was an adviser to a special unit made up of only Draconics during the Demon War."
CH8_Main_11_013,"Oh? A wizard that uses fire."
CH8_Main_11_014,"Wh-what?"
CH8_Main_11_015,"Why are you looking at me like that?"
CH8_Main_11_016,"Roi, is it because my magic doesn't work on Draconics!?"
CH8_Main_11_017,"Hm? I didn't say anything."
CH8_Main_11_018,"I'm just wondering who is more skilled with fire magic, between you and Infira."
CH8_Main_11_019,"You shouldn't compare me to a Demon!"
CH8_Main_11_020,"Ha ha, humans are funny."
CH8_Main_11_021,"Looking at human friends is always an interesting thing to do."
CH8_Main_11_022,"Right?"
CH8_Main_11_023,"They go really well together."
CH8_Main_11_024,"No!!!"
CH8_Main_11_025,"By the way, Laias, you're... different earlier. What was that...?"
CH8_Main_11_026,"I felt overpowered..."
CH8_Main_11_027,"Oh, sorry. Ha ha..."
CH8_Main_11_028,"I showed some of my dragon nature to provoke the Draconics."
CH8_Main_11_029,"It wasn't as strong as when I'm in a dragon form, but I released it just enough for them to lose their reason."
CH8_Main_11_030,"I wasn't able to control my power completely, though."
CH8_Main_11_031,"And I spoke like my old self... Hahaha. Sorry for showing you that."
CH8_Main_11_032,"Ahahaha...."
CH8_Main_12_001,"Northwest Dwarf ruins... Enemy... found."
CH8_Main_12_002,"Five humans including the wielder of the Holy Sword... One Dwarf... One dragon."
CH8_Main_12_003,"Dragon... cannot be captured..."
CH8_Main_12_004,"Hmph. Weakling."
CH8_Main_12_005,"So the ruins in the northwest."
CH8_Main_12_006,"So they want to use the traps set by the Dwarves to stop ground forces, and to keep away the Draconics."
CH8_Main_12_007,"I can see through it. Bweh heh... They are all weaklings anyway, except for the Priestess of Water."
CH8_Main_12_008,"Dragons wouldn't kill each other so easily."
CH8_Main_12_009,"Go, Temeraire! Go on a rampage, kill them, and destroy everything!!"
CH8_Main_12_010,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_13_001,"Hm... I thought they would send some Draconics a few times at least..."
CH8_Main_13_002,"But they sent Temeraire right away."
CH8_Main_13_003,"Infira really likes to use overwhelming force."
CH8_Main_13_004,"Yanne, you have the location?"
CH8_Main_13_005,"Yes, I've arrived."
CH8_Main_13_006,"I can shoot anytime!"
CH8_Main_13_007,"Okay, we're counting on you."
CH8_Main_13_008,"Now, let's make an opening for Yanne to shoot!"
CH8_Main_14_001,"Now, Yanne!"
CH8_Main_14_002,"Leave it to me!"
CH8_Main_14_003,"Take this!!"
CH8_Main_14_004,"*Huff...* Did we succeed?"
CH8_Main_14_005,"*Coughs* I'm not sure yet."
CH8_Main_14_006,"Don't let your guard down!"
CH8_Main_14_007,"Temeraire..."
CH8_Main_14_008,"Temeraire, my old friend."
CH8_Main_14_009,"You've lost all reason, and even your soul is filled with anger and madness."
CH8_Main_14_010,"But it's okay. Just go to sleep now."
CH8_Main_14_011,"Once you rest for a long time... Everything will be better..."
CH8_Main_14_012,"...."
CH8_Main_14_013,"Bweh heh heh... Bwahahaha!!"
CH8_Main_14_014,"Found you, Laias!"
CH8_Main_14_015,"..?!"
CH8_Main_14_016,"Y-you're..."
CH8_Main_14_017,"You're not Temeraire."
CH8_Main_14_018,"Bweh heh heh, you got half the answer right."
CH8_Main_14_019,"This is the body of your old friend, Temeraire."
CH8_Main_14_020,"But its mind is under my control!"
CH8_Main_14_021,"Infira..."
CH8_Main_14_022,"It was you."
CH8_Main_14_023,"Ha ha, the great Blue Dragon knows me. What an honor."
CH8_Main_14_024,"Oh. I did fight your siblings."
CH8_Main_14_025,"I could've killed Neraxis last time, but I didn't get to."
CH8_Main_14_026,"Bwahahaha!"
CH8_Main_14_027,"You're using a curse to control his mind..."
CH8_Main_14_028,"Hm. I have no other choice."
CH8_Main_14_029,"Hm? Hey!"
CH8_Main_14_030,"Hey! Wait! Don't ignore me!"
CH8_Main_14_031,"Hey!!!!"
CH8_Main_14_032,"Yanne. We'll have to change plans."
CH8_Main_14_033,"Could you regroup with us?"
CH8_Main_14_034,"Okay. I'll be there!"
CH8_Main_14_035,"The purging didn't work?"
CH8_Main_14_036,"It worked... But it wasn't regular mind control."
CH8_Main_14_037,"He was using a curse to directly take his mind and take over his body."
CH8_Main_14_038,"A curse!?"
CH8_Main_14_039,"I'm not sure how Infira gained that power..."
CH8_Main_14_040,"But we'll have to immobilize Temeraire now."
CH8_Main_14_041,"Everyone, do your best!"
CH8_Main_14_042,"Kuh, you dare ignore me!?"
CH8_Main_14_043,"Don't think you'll die without suffering first, trash!"
CH8_Main_14_044,"Trample them, Temeraire!"
CH8_Main_14_045,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_15_001,"Kuh, the heat from the breath...!"
CH8_Main_15_002,"We have to endure it!"
CH8_Main_15_003,"Fortunately, we have Laias's magic,"
CH8_Main_15_004,"but we won't last long...!"
CH8_Main_15_005,"Again, again, again!"
CH8_Main_15_006,"Why is everyone here resistant to fire!?"
CH8_Main_15_007,"My magic isn't working!!"
CH8_Main_15_008,"Well, it's a volcano... and it's the Red Dragon, so isn't it obvious?"
CH8_Main_15_009,"I know, Roi, you idiot!!"
CH8_Main_15_010,"It's not like you're doing much, either, Roi!"
CH8_Main_15_011,"Well, my dagger'll do nothing to that big body."
CH8_Main_15_012,"But I can keep the rocks and boulders from hitting you."
CH8_Main_15_013,"Yaaah! I'm mad, too! I wanna do something!"
CH8_Main_15_014,"If it wasn't for Laias's shield and Pavel's frost, it would've been dangerous."
CH8_Main_15_015,"Anyway, the only ones who can even hurt that monster are..."
CH8_Main_15_016,"Yanne and Laias."
CH8_Main_15_017,"Laias, you won't turn into a dragon?"
CH8_Main_15_018,"If I turn into a dragon in a place like this, you'll be in danger too."
CH8_Main_15_019,"I think it will be safer if I fight in this form."
CH8_Main_15_020,"But I don't think we'll be able to defeat him like this."
CH8_Main_15_021,"...."
CH8_Main_15_022,"Alright, I have an idea."
CH8_Main_15_023,"It's a gamble, though...!"
CH8_Main_16_001,"Kuh! This is a dragon... Every attack from it is just too strong!"
CH8_Main_16_002,"The shield is reaching its limit, too...!"
CH8_Main_16_003,"Just a bit more!"
CH8_Main_16_004,"We just have to lure him over there!"
CH8_Main_16_005,"The volcano monsters are in the way!"
CH8_Main_16_006,"Wow, a lava golem!"
CH8_Main_16_007,"Roi..."
CH8_Main_16_008,"This isn't the time, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_16_009,"I'll bust through them! Haaa!"
CH8_Main_16_010,"Bwahahaha, there's no use in resisting!"
CH8_Main_16_011,"No matter what you do, you can't win against me!!"
CH8_Main_16_012,"If you want to win, you should reveal your true dragon form!!"
CH8_Main_16_013,"And then, the humans around you will all die."
CH8_Main_16_014,"Bwa ha ha ha!!!"
CH8_Main_17_001,"Alright. Now!"
CH8_Main_17_002,"Everyone, get down and be careful!"
CH8_Main_17_003,"Bwahahaha, this is all you could come up with?"
CH8_Main_17_004,"There's no way the arrows of a Dwarf would penetrate Temeraire's scales!"
CH8_Main_17_005,"..."
CH8_Main_17_006,"Hm? Where's Laias...!?"
CH8_Main_17_007,"Get off."
CH8_Main_17_008,"Kyaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_17_009,"Kuh. Was the trap a fake...?"
CH8_Main_17_010,"Hmpf, this attack doesn't even hurt... Hm?"
CH8_Main_17_011,"That's the signal. Do it, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_17_012,"Finally... Finally it's time for this archmage to shine!"
CH8_Main_17_013,"I'll bury you, you red lizard!!!"
CH8_Main_17_014,"Kwaaaah!?"
CH8_Main_17_015,"Ignorant buffoons! What are you doing!?"
CH8_Main_17_016,"Ha ha, these ruins were made by ancient Dwarves."
CH8_Main_17_017,"They carved out a mountain and set up all these traps and devices."
CH8_Main_17_018,"But if none of the traps work..."
CH8_Main_17_019,"There's this left."
CH8_Main_17_020,"Kuh, I'll kill you, you little cretin!"
CH8_Main_17_021,"All I have to do is get away...!"
CH8_Main_17_022,"Impossible. As long as your wings and body are under that many rocks,"
CH8_Main_17_023,"not even a dragon will be able to leave easily."
CH8_Main_17_024,"Hmph. Don't make me laugh!!!!"
CH8_Main_17_025,"Kuh, this is!?"
CH8_Main_17_026,"You melted the rocks...!"
CH8_Main_17_027,"You think you can stop me with this!?"
CH8_Main_17_028,"I'll kill you first, pipsqueak!"
CH8_Main_17_029,"We don't have time. We need to remove the curse now!"
CH8_Main_17_030,"The Holy Sword should be able to do that."
CH8_Main_17_031,"But getting near Temeraire while he's like that is...!"
CH8_Main_17_032,"..."
CH8_Main_17_033,"No, Kasel! It's too dangerous!"
CH8_Main_17_034,"But if I don't do it...!"
CH8_Main_17_035,"Kasel, that sword..."
CH8_Main_17_036,"Will its power work even if it's away from you?"
CH8_Main_17_037,"What? Oh, I never tried, but...!"
CH8_Main_17_038,"Alright. Let's give it a try!"
CH8_Main_17_039,"Come here!"
CH8_Main_17_040,"Now, take a deep breath, and pull the string."
CH8_Main_17_041,"Kasel: Hrgh...! This bow...!"
CH8_Main_17_042,"Kasel: So heavy... And the string is so tight..."
CH8_Main_17_043,"Kasel: Yanne, you wielded something like this so easily...!"
CH8_Main_17_044,"Yanne: Hahaha. Well, if anything, I have confidence in my strength."
CH8_Main_17_045,"Yanne: Don't think about anything else. Focus on the Holy Sword, and control its power."
CH8_Main_17_046,"Yanne: I'll help you with the aiming and shooting."
CH8_Main_17_047,"Focus... Focus..."
CH8_Main_17_048,"Holy Sword... Goddess..."
CH8_Main_17_049,"Grant me the power to get through this...!"
CH8_Main_17_050,"Kasel: Now, Yanne!"
CH8_Main_17_051,"Yanne: Alright! Fire----!!!!"
CH8_Main_17_052,"Kwaaa!!! Die, you trash!"
CH8_Main_17_053,"Gugh!?"
CH8_Main_17_054,"This is... the Holy Sword!"
CH8_Main_17_055,"No! My power... The power that he gave me...!!!"
CH8_Main_17_056,"Kwaaahhh!!!"
CH8_Main_18_001,"It's finally over... *Sigh.* That fight was just too much."
CH8_Main_18_002,"I didn't think he would be able to move under that pile of rocks..."
CH8_Main_18_003,"By the way, Yanne. It was a great idea to use the Holy Sword like an arrow."
CH8_Main_18_004,"Hahaha. Well, it's not the first time I did it."
CH8_Main_18_005,"I've used swords and spears to shoot with my bow before."
CH8_Main_18_006,"Well, they don't fly as well as arrows..."
CH8_Main_18_007,"Maybe because it's the Holy Sword? It felt different from when I shoot a regular sword."
CH8_Main_18_008,"Hahaha... I'm glad no one's seriously hurt."
CH8_Main_18_009,"It's because you protected us from the front, Phillop."
CH8_Main_18_010,"Hahaha, thanks for saying that."
CH8_Main_18_011,"Frey, Frey, did you watch me fight?"
CH8_Main_18_012,"I did well, huh!? Didn't I?"
CH8_Main_18_013,"Yes, Cleo. You were great."
CH8_Main_18_014,"You get so big-headed... Hahaha."
CH8_Main_18_015,"You felt so down because your attacks weren't working earlier."
CH8_Main_18_016,"Wh-who said I was down!?"
CH8_Main_18_017,"Eek! Idiot! That idiot, Roi!"
CH8_Main_18_018,"Hey, that hurts. C'mon, don't hit me."
CH8_Main_18_019,"We succeeded in making Temeraire fall asleep."
CH8_Main_18_020,"It won't last long since it's an artificial slumber, though..."
CH8_Main_18_021,"As long as no one wakes him up, he will sleep for over 10 years."
CH8_Main_18_022,"Hahaha... 10 years..."
CH8_Main_18_023,"Kasel, did you find the Holy Sword?"
CH8_Main_18_024,"Oh, yes. Actually..."
CH8_Main_18_025,"When I went to Temeraire to look for the Holy Sword,"
CH8_Main_18_026,"it appeared in front of me from the sky."
CH8_Main_18_027,"Just like when it first came to me..."
CH8_Main_18_028,"Oh, how interesting."
CH8_Main_18_029,"I guess that's proof that you were chosen as the master of the Holy Sword?"
CH8_Main_18_030,"I heard that the Holy Sword goes back to its master, no matter where it is."
CH8_Main_18_031,"Hm. So even if Kasel returned the Holy Sword to the palace..."
CH8_Main_18_032,"It would have returned to him, anyway."
CH8_Main_18_033,"Oh. Ahahaha... Maybe."
CH8_Main_18_034,"I feel stupid for worrying about all those things in the past."
CH8_Main_18_035,"Ha ha, isn't that proof that you've grown, Kasel?"
CH8_Main_18_036,"Hahaha, maybe. Thanks, Frey."
CH8_Main_18_037,"We'll have to decide what to do next."
CH8_Main_18_038,"We took care of Temeraire, and we retrieved the Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_18_039,"Now, are we heading to the volcano?"
CH8_Main_18_040,"Hm... I'm concerned about what Infira said about 'him.'"
CH8_Main_18_041,"We might find out whether Balalaika and Malduk were talking about the same one, the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_18_042,"Wasn't the goal to gather information?"
CH8_Main_18_043,"We might be able to find out the details if we go to the volcano."
CH8_Main_18_044,"It's decided, then."
CH8_Main_18_045,"We don't know when the Draconics will come, so let's get moving."
CH8_Main_18_046,"Hm. Sorry, but I'll stay here."
CH8_Main_18_047,"Huh? Why?"
CH8_Main_18_048,"It will be very bad if the Draconics come here to wake up Temeraire and try to control him again."
CH8_Main_18_049,"Someone must say here to protect it."
CH8_Main_18_050,"Like I said, there are many caves here that lead to the Dwarven Kingdom."
CH8_Main_18_051,"If we set up some bases here by calling the Dwarven army, we should be able to stop those Draconics."
CH8_Main_18_052,"As long as Temeraire is not awakened that is."
CH8_Main_18_053,"I see..."
CH8_Main_18_054,"Thank you, Phillop."
CH8_Main_18_055,"Bwahaha, what's there to thank me for?"
CH8_Main_18_056,"Now, get moving. We'll meet again."
CH8_Main_19_001,"Kwaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_19_002,"Those filthy bastards dared to...!"
CH8_Main_19_003,"Form an army and take back Temeraire!!!"
CH8_Main_19_004,"If you don't retrieve him by tomorrow, you are all dead!!!"
CH8_Main_19_005,"Hmph. How unsightly, Infira."
CH8_Main_19_006,"It's your fault that you lost Temeraire."
CH8_Main_19_007,"Don't take it out on your pawns, and think of how you'll make up for your mistake."
CH8_Main_19_008,"Damn it, I don't need your advice!"
CH8_Main_19_009,"I'll kill him..."
CH8_Main_19_010,"That warrior of the Holy Sword...!"
CH8_Main_19_011,"Hmph. That's all you're worth, in the end."
CH8_Main_19_012,"By the way, I'm interested now..."
CH8_Main_19_013,"To find out how much the Warrior of the Holy Sword has grown..."
CH8_Main_20_001,"That's...!"
CH8_Main_20_002,"Morrah."
CH8_Main_20_003,"Heh. It's been a while."
CH8_Main_20_004,"I heard you had some unique comrades with you."
CH8_Main_20_005,"It's been a while, Priestess of the Flow."
CH8_Main_20_006,"Draconic Commander, Morrah."
CH8_Main_20_007,"Heh, I've left that position behind a long time ago."
CH8_Main_20_008,"Infira took over, but he's not reliable."
CH8_Main_20_009,"I'm just a knight loyal to Maria."
CH8_Main_20_010,"You are not with Infira?"
CH8_Main_20_011,"Hmph. I don't care about small fry like him."
CH8_Main_20_012,"Demons don't care about things like loyalty to their own race."
CH8_Main_20_013,"I only carry out my missions."
CH8_Main_20_014,"You don't sound like a monster that took the lives of countless dragons."
CH8_Main_20_015,"What happened to your violent self?"
CH8_Main_20_016,"Do I have to answer that?"
CH8_Main_20_017,"Fine."
CH8_Main_20_018,"The reason why I came here today is..."
CH8_Main_20_019,"Him, actually."
CH8_Main_20_020,"What is it?"
CH8_Main_20_021,"We've already fought twice, human. Don't be so cold."
CH8_Main_20_022,"Didn't Maria tell you?"
CH8_Main_20_023,"You can't die yet."
CH8_Main_20_024,"...?"
CH8_Main_20_025,"If you are still at the same level as last time, you'll die in the near future."
CH8_Main_20_026,"That's why I'll be testing you to see how much you've grown."
CH8_Main_20_027,"If you want, you can all come at me."
CH8_Main_20_028,"Don't worry, I won't kill you."
CH8_Main_20_029,"I'm not worried."
CH8_Main_20_030,"If you want to test me... I'll fight alone."
CH8_Main_20_031,"But..."
CH8_Main_20_032,"Will you be okay, Kasel?"
CH8_Main_20_033,"I'll be alright, Frey."
CH8_Main_20_034,"She's had plenty of chances to kill us, but she hasn't taken them."
CH8_Main_20_035,"I'm sure there's a meaning to this."
CH8_Main_20_036,"Then- takes this, Morrah!!"
CH8_Main_20_037,"Come, Warrior of the Holy Sword!"
CH8_Main_20_038,"Prove your strength to me!"
CH8_Main_21_001,"Phew... You sure got stronger."
CH8_Main_21_002,"The power of the Holy Sword is almost complete, too."
CH8_Main_21_003,"That was a little fun."
CH8_Main_21_004,"Even with that Holy Power..."
CH8_Main_21_005,"She seems stronger than last time...!"
CH8_Main_21_006,"I did have a hard time controlling my power since you guys got stronger."
CH8_Main_21_007,"After all, I can't have the owner of the Holy Sword die so easily."
CH8_Main_21_008,"..."
CH8_Main_21_009,"I have... a question."
CH8_Main_21_010,"Well, go ahead."
CH8_Main_21_011,"What are you and Maria trying to do?"
CH8_Main_21_012,"Are you part of the Dark Legion? Or..."
CH8_Main_21_013,"..."
CH8_Main_21_014,"I can't answer that."
CH8_Main_21_015,"I'll tell you this, though."
CH8_Main_21_016,"You are not strong enough yet."
CH8_Main_21_017,"If you don't get stronger..."
CH8_Main_21_018,"You'll definitely die."
CH8_Main_21_019,"Strengthen your own self, not just the Holy Sword's power."
CH8_Main_21_020,"You'll need to do that If you want to fight him... the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_22_001,"So, it was the Black Knight..."
CH8_Main_22_002,"What do you think his goal is?"
CH8_Main_22_003,"Going around the continent doing this..."
CH8_Main_22_004,"Hm... I'm not sure, either."
CH8_Main_22_005,"No one knows the Dark Legion's real goal."
CH8_Main_22_006,"All we know is that the Dark Lord Angmund tried to annihilate all living things in the material world,"
CH8_Main_22_007,"but the reason behind his actions is all a mystery."
CH8_Main_22_008,"I don't think this is the time to worry about that."
CH8_Main_22_009,"We have something more urgent to worry about."
CH8_Main_23_001,"What happened just now... Something wasn't right."
CH8_Main_23_002,"What do you mean?"
CH8_Main_23_003,"The battle just now was too easy."
CH8_Main_23_004,"Even if we're getting used to fighting the Draconics,"
CH8_Main_23_005,"now that Phillop is out, the battle shouldn't have been this easy..."
CH8_Main_23_006,"I think we're being lured into a trap."
CH8_Main_23_007,"Why do you think that?"
CH8_Main_23_008,"It's a method used when hunting."
CH8_Main_23_009,"When hunting aggressive prey,"
CH8_Main_23_010,"it's easy to lure it into a trap after provoking it a little."
CH8_Main_23_011,"Then, shouldn't we not follow them?"
CH8_Main_23_012,"It would be good if that was possible..."
CH8_Main_23_013,"This is the only way to the volcano, though."
CH8_Main_23_014,"We'll just have to be careful."
CH8_Main_24_001,"Running away again? How far will they lure us in..."
CH8_Main_24_002,"Now it's past the lava river..."
CH8_Main_24_003,"I think there's a path that leads to the top of the volcano to the northeast."
CH8_Main_24_004,"Can't we go up that way?"
CH8_Main_24_005,"There's a cursed castle gate that the Demons made there."
CH8_Main_24_006,"As long as the Draconics are guarding it, no one outside the Dark Legion can get past."
CH8_Main_24_007,"I could transform into a dragon and fly over it,"
CH8_Main_24_008,"but the Draconics will go berserk and come at us. It's too dangerous to risk."
CH8_Main_24_009,"We'll have to follow the Draconics that ran away."
CH8_Main_24_010,"I don't like it. Walking right into an obvious trap..."
CH8_Main_25_001,"Hm!? That's..."
CH8_Main_25_002,"A middle class Demon... They look like the Demons that came from the Pandemonium a hundred years ago."
CH8_Main_25_003,"Hm, they're blocking the way. Are they like gatekeepers...?"
CH8_Main_25_004,"Behind us! Watch out!"
CH8_Main_25_005,"Ugh!? The Draconics are attacking all at once...!"
CH8_Main_25_006,"In the name of the Goddess...!"
CH8_Main_25_007,"Watch out! The shield won't last long...!"
CH8_Main_26_001,"There's no end to them...!"
CH8_Main_26_002,"Do they plan on just killing us here...!"
CH8_Main_26_003,"Hm!? That's..."
CH8_Main_26_004,"Tsk. So nasty. Those over there look more delicious."
CH8_Main_26_005,"Stop eating, seriously."
CH8_Main_26_006,"Is that all you think about?"
CH8_Main_26_007,"Huh? What's more important than eating?"
CH8_Main_26_008,"By the way, where is your dad?"
CH8_Main_26_009,"I want to eat him."
CH8_Main_26_010,"Don't push it. I'm the one who wants to kill that trash the most."
CH8_Main_26_011,"Hey. Everyone's looking. Stop eating."
CH8_Main_26_012,"You always just keep eating, even when it's really bad."
CH8_Main_26_013,"I was hungry. What can I do?"
CH8_Main_26_014,"Hello. I don't eat humans, so they don't have to worry."
CH8_Main_26_015,"And I don't like the souls of dragons."
CH8_Main_26_016,"I like eating Demons, though."
CH8_Main_26_017,"You're talking about eating again!"
CH8_Main_26_018,"What about it!?"
CH8_Main_26_019,"Go over there and eat those stupid Draconics!"
CH8_Main_26_020,"I will!"
CH8_Main_26_021,"&%$#!?&%$#!?"
CH8_Main_26_022,"....???"
CH8_Main_26_023,"Who were they?"
CH8_Main_26_024,"I'm not sure..."
CH8_Main_26_025,"The girl definitely looks like a Demon..."
CH8_Main_26_026,"The guy doesn't look like it..."
CH8_Main_26_027,"A Demon possessing a human body, and..."
CH8_Main_26_028,"I didn't think I would see something so interesting."
CH8_Main_26_029,"A half-human half-Demon born between a human and a Demon..."
CH8_Main_26_030,"A half-human half-Demon!?"
CH8_Main_26_031,"That's the discovery of the century!"
CH8_Main_26_032,"Alright. Let's bet on who can kill more!"
CH8_Main_26_033,"Geh heh heh, another obvious bet."
CH8_Main_26_034,"Of course, I'll kill more than a half breed like you!"
CH8_Main_26_035,"Don't make me laugh, crab-legs!"
CH8_Main_26_036,"I won last time, alright!?"
CH8_Main_26_037,"No, you didn't!"
CH8_Main_26_038,"Stop fooling around!!!"
CH8_Main_27_001,"Hm, thank you for helping..."
CH8_Main_27_002,"But we don't know your names yet."
CH8_Main_27_003,"Hm? Name?"
CH8_Main_27_004,"You're asking for a Demon's name? What a strange human."
CH8_Main_27_005,"I'm Viska. I'm the future Dark Lord."
CH8_Main_27_006,"Oh, and this beanpole is Ezekiel."
CH8_Main_27_007,"Future Dark Lord!?"
CH8_Main_27_008,"See, they're surprised."
CH8_Main_27_009,"It's not like she's a descendant of the Dark Lord or anything."
CH8_Main_27_010,"Just an idiot who only wants to get stronger."
CH8_Main_27_011,"Idiot? How rude."
CH8_Main_27_012,"Oh, and I like fine food."
CH8_Main_27_013,"There's nothing better than the soul of a strong Demon, though."
CH8_Main_27_014,"The souls of these Draconics are pretty good, too... Heh heh heh heh."
CH8_Main_27_015,"(Oh... We might be able to use her.)"
CH8_Main_27_016,"Thanks for helping, but..."
CH8_Main_27_017,"That body is originally a human's..."
CH8_Main_27_018,"Hm? Oh, don't worry. It was a fair contract. I didn't steal it."
CH8_Main_27_019,"If it weren't for me, this girl would have died a long time ago."
CH8_Main_27_020,"..."
CH8_Main_27_021,"I think I heard something about a half-human half-Demon..."
CH8_Main_27_022,"Hm... Well, it's something like that."
CH8_Main_27_023,"So what? You got a problem?"
CH8_Main_27_024,"The existence of Half-human half-Demons have never been confirmed in any of my books!"
CH8_Main_27_025,"Of course, I'm curious as a wizard!"
CH8_Main_27_026,"Tsk. Another annoying hassle."
CH8_Main_27_027,"What brings you two here...?"
CH8_Main_27_028,"Oh, I want to kill that Malduk."
CH8_Main_27_029,"I was going to go across the desert to the swamps of Gargoss..."
CH8_Main_27_030,"But then I saw the Dark Legion moving."
CH8_Main_27_031,"M-Malduk!?"
CH8_Main_27_032,"Hm, so it was after we met..."
CH8_Main_27_033,"So I was going around killing strong Demons, and that's when I saw him."
CH8_Main_27_034,"Oh, I was looking around for a Succubus..."
CH8_Main_27_035,"And then, she just attacked me."
CH8_Main_27_036,"Well, I stopped fighting after I found out he was a half breed."
CH8_Main_27_037,"I didn't think he would taste good, anyway."
CH8_Main_27_038,"I won last time we fought, alright!?"
CH8_Main_27_039,"No, you didn't!"
CH8_Main_27_040,"Anyway. It looked like the Succubus flew this way."
CH8_Main_27_041,"So, I was heading to the volcano after the fight, and she followed me."
CH8_Main_27_042,"I'm interested in that Succubus..."
CH8_Main_27_043,"And something smells delicious near the volcano."
CH8_Main_27_044,"Hey, don't try to eat the Succubus."
CH8_Main_27_045,"I promised Theo."
CH8_Main_27_046,"Though I don't care if you eat any Draconics."
CH8_Main_27_047,"Hm? Oh, I'll think about it."
CH8_Main_27_048,"Who knows? Maybe there's a powerful Demon in the volcano that will satisfy my cravings."
CH8_Main_27_049,"You eat the souls of Demons, right?"
CH8_Main_27_050,"At the top of the volcano, there's a powerful Draconic named Infira."
CH8_Main_27_051,"You might get to meet him if you come with us."
CH8_Main_27_052,"Really!?"
CH8_Main_27_053,"Kukuku... Keke... I like you."
CH8_Main_27_054,"Alright, I'm coming! His soul is mine, though, okay?"
CH8_Main_27_055,"Tsk. Bothersome."
CH8_Main_27_056,"Well, we might as well end this."
CH8_Main_27_057,"Roi... What are you planning?"
CH8_Main_28_001,"Kahahaha, I'll cut you to pieces!!!"
CH8_Main_28_002,"Die! Die! Die!!!"
CH8_Main_28_003,"Goddess..."
CH8_Main_28_004,"Hm, they really fight well."
CH8_Main_28_005,"Maybe because they are Demons... They got incredibly powerful charges."
CH8_Main_28_006,"That's why the Draconics can't do anything about it."
CH8_Main_28_007,"They don't have time to strategize..."
CH8_Main_28_008,"They really fight well, but..."
CH8_Main_28_009,"Roi, will it be okay?"
CH8_Main_28_010,"They are Demons, but they are not all evil."
CH8_Main_28_011,"It was the same with Epis. She just did whatever pleased her."
CH8_Main_28_012,"Likewise, Viska has her own goal."
CH8_Main_28_013,"And Ezekiel... He said he made a promise to Theo."
CH8_Main_28_014,"We could say that he's loyal."
CH8_Main_28_015,"Hahaha, you like analyzing people?"
CH8_Main_28_016,"It was just a skill I needed in my old work."
CH8_Main_28_017,"I'm pretty confident in my ability to read people."
CH8_Main_28_018,"But they are Demons."
CH8_Main_28_019,"Well, that's true."
CH8_Main_28_020,"Hm? What? What's going on?"
CH8_Main_28_021,"Were you eating something good without me?"
CH8_Main_28_022,"Don't be like that!"
CH8_Main_28_023,"Hahaha, it's not that."
CH8_Main_28_024,"If you're hungry, I made a snack with monster meat..."
CH8_Main_28_025,"Snack!!!"
CH8_Main_28_026,"You fight like crazy beast,"
CH8_Main_28_027,"and you act like that when someone feeds you?"
CH8_Main_28_028,"Ahaha...."
CH8_Main_28_029,"There are all kinds of Demons, I guess."
CH8_Main_28_030,"I met a Demon named Epis before, and she was similar..."
CH8_Main_28_031,"Huh? You know Epis?"
CH8_Main_28_032,"The Succubus I'm looking for is her."
CH8_Main_28_033,"When did you see her? Where?"
CH8_Main_28_034,"Huh? Oh, I saw Epis a while ago."
CH8_Main_28_035,"The last time was at Galluah Plains..."
CH8_Main_28_036,"Well, if you didn't see her recently, you must not know where she is now."
CH8_Main_28_037,"Tsk. I got excited for nothing."
CH8_Main_28_038,"You said you made a promise to Theo, right? Who is he?"
CH8_Main_28_039,"Oh... It's hard to explain."
CH8_Main_28_040,"In short, he's an idiotic human."
CH8_Main_28_041,"He's staying in Aegina to help other people fight Demons."
CH8_Main_28_042,"He said he's a knight of the Republic of Gray, and that he can't just let people suffer..."
CH8_Main_28_043,"Ugh. That's why he couldn't even do what he wanted for the past 10 years."
CH8_Main_28_044,"He can't be left alone, seriously."
CH8_Main_28_045,"Ha ha. He's helping the people of the desert while I'm not there... I'm grateful for that."
CH8_Main_28_046,"I'll have to go thank him later."
CH8_Main_28_047,"Gray? I've heard that name before..."
CH8_Main_28_048,"Oh! That's the Republic of Gray that Epis spoke about!"
CH8_Main_28_049,"Didn't the Republic of Gray fall 100 years ago?"
CH8_Main_28_050,"He's not an Undead, is he? Like Jane..."
CH8_Main_29_001,"*Huff... Huff...*"
CH8_Main_29_002,"The number of Draconics is increasing."
CH8_Main_29_003,"It feels harder to get through their defense..."
CH8_Main_29_004,"Hey, you're tired already?"
CH8_Main_29_005,"So pathetic. You call yourself the Warrior of the Holy Sword?"
CH8_Main_29_006,"I heard a warrior in the past even defeated Angmund?"
CH8_Main_29_007,"Thanks to that, my plan to eat the Dark Lord and become the new Dark Lord failed."
CH8_Main_29_008,"But shouldn't you have at least that much power if you're a warrior?"
CH8_Main_29_009,"It's strange hearing that from a Demon."
CH8_Main_29_010,"I can't say anything about it, though. It's true that I'm not strong enough..."
CH8_Main_29_011,"I'll have to try harder to get stronger."
CH8_Main_29_012,"If you have the will to get stronger, that's enough."
CH8_Main_29_013,"It's better to acknowledge your weakness and try to get stronger,"
CH8_Main_29_014,"than act strong when you are really weak."
CH8_Main_29_015,"Hmm... Never thought I'd hear you say something like that."
CH8_Main_29_016,"Tsk. Come on. Who do you think I am?"
CH8_Main_29_017,"A fatty idiot beast."
CH8_Main_29_018,"I'll eat you first, then!"
CH8_Main_29_019,"Hahaha, you two seem so close."
CH8_Main_29_020,"Right, Frey?"
CH8_Main_29_021,"Yes. It's like watching Cleo and Roi..."
CH8_Main_29_022,"What part of it!!!"
CH8_Main_30_001,"It's the way up to the Dragia Volcano now..."
CH8_Main_30_002,"The top of the volcano used to be Temeraire's nest."
CH8_Main_30_003,"Now it's been occupied by the Draconics and has become their castle..."
CH8_Main_30_004,"Are you sure this way up is safer than the other ways?"
CH8_Main_30_005,"Yes. There's nothing on the terrain that the Draconics could use strategically."
CH8_Main_30_006,"It's also the only way through the ground to go up the mountain."
CH8_Main_30_007,"It won't be easy to go up."
CH8_Main_30_008,"Since they'll be waiting for us up there..."
CH8_Main_30_009,"Heh heh heh, no matter. I'll just eat them all."
CH8_Main_30_010,"This time will be a real feast!"
CH8_Main_31_001,"You dare come to your own tomb, warrior!?"
CH8_Main_31_002,"Infira...!"
CH8_Main_31_003,"You dared to ruin my plans!"
CH8_Main_31_004,"Before you die, you'll experience true pain!"
CH8_Main_31_005,"Ha, come on."
CH8_Main_31_006,"Is talking all you can do?"
CH8_Main_31_007,"How about you shut up and come at me?"
CH8_Main_31_008,"A Demon? Why is a Demon with the humans...!?"
CH8_Main_31_009,"Heh heh, with the humans?"
CH8_Main_31_010,"I just don't like you all."
CH8_Main_31_011,"I don't care about the weak residents of the material world."
CH8_Main_31_012,"Live or die, they can do whatever they want to."
CH8_Main_31_013,"I just want to eat you all! Gah hah hah!"
CH8_Main_31_014,"I knew I sent enough soldiers to kill all those humans,"
CH8_Main_31_015,"and I thought it was weird when I didn't hear back..."
CH8_Main_31_016,"So, it was you!"
CH8_Main_31_017,"Oh, you sent them?"
CH8_Main_31_018,"You were all so delicious. It was a feast!"
CH8_Main_31_019,"How about you let me eat you, too? Heh heh heh!"
CH8_Main_31_020,"Hah! You fools just can't see the big picture!"
CH8_Main_31_021,"I don't care if it's humans, dragons, or Demons!"
CH8_Main_31_022,"I'll get rid of anyone who gets in the way!"
CH8_Main_31_023,"Left Unit, you kill those two Demons!"
CH8_Main_31_024,"Subdue them! Don't let them get away!"
CH8_Main_31_025,"Right Unit, you kill the warrior and the others!"
CH8_Main_31_026,"If you don't, you'll die by my hands!"
CH8_Main_32_001,"Infira: Damn, damn, damn!"
CH8_Main_32_002,"Infira: Idiots! You couldn't even kill a single one--!!!"
CH8_Main_32_003,"Heh heh, this is fun."
CH8_Main_32_004,"It's time to binge!"
CH8_Main_32_005,"I'll eat every single one of you!!"
CH8_Main_32_006,"Gwa ha ha, don't get a stomachache!"
CH8_Main_32_007,"You'll eat their leader over there, too, won't you!?"
CH8_Main_32_008,"Isn't it obvious? Kyahaha!"
CH8_Main_32_009,"No more playing around!"
CH8_Main_32_010,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_32_011,"Kuh, none of you can kill the warrior? Even the small fries backing him up are still alive!?"
CH8_Main_32_012,"Move, you trash!"
CH8_Main_32_013,"I'll do it myself!"
CH8_Main_33_001,"Kuh!"
CH8_Main_33_002,"You filthy bastards dared to...!"
CH8_Main_33_003,"You think I'll fall for those stupid attacks!?"
CH8_Main_33_004,"You're still talking like that, even though you're getting wrecked!?"
CH8_Main_33_005,"Hmph. Your attacks can't even tickle me!"
CH8_Main_33_006,"And you! You dare attack me with those lowly fire attacks? Are you stupid!?"
CH8_Main_33_007,"What did you say!?"
CH8_Main_33_008,"Don't fall for it, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_33_009,"He's just bluffing, now that he's losing!"
CH8_Main_33_010,"Kwaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_33_011,"No way! I can't end like this!"
CH8_Main_33_012,"I have no other choice...!!!"
CH8_Main_33_013,"?!!"
CH8_Main_33_014,"His own pawns...!?"
CH8_Main_33_015,"Die, you trash!"
CH8_Main_33_016,"Give me all your power!!"
CH8_Main_33_017,"This is bad. We have to stop him...!"
CH8_Main_33_018,"What is going on?"
CH8_Main_33_019,"He's about to go berserk!"
CH8_Main_33_020,"If we don't stop him...!"
CH8_Main_33_021,"Too late, trash!!!"
CH8_Main_33_022,"Kwaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_33_023,"Alright. Everyone, move away!"
CH8_Main_33_024,"I'm worried that the remaining Draconics will also go berserk... But this is the only way...!"
CH8_Main_33_025,"Infira: Graaaagh!!!"
CH8_Main_33_026,"Infira: Die, dragon!!!"
CH8_Main_33_027,"Laias: ...Fake Dragon."
CH8_Main_33_028,"Laias: The power that you gained by killing my kin - "
CH8_Main_33_029,"Laias: It is time to return it to the flow of the world!!"
CH8_Main_33_030,"Infira: Kukuku, don't make me laugh!"
CH8_Main_33_031,"Infira: I'll absorb the last of the power from the Draconics in this area."
CH8_Main_33_032,"Infira: Then I'll bite your neck off,"
CH8_Main_33_033,"Infira: and trample the rest of you - !!!!"
CH8_Main_33_034,"Kuh, this is crazy...!"
CH8_Main_33_035,"This is how dragons fight...!"
CH8_Main_33_036,"Kyah! Won't we be crushed if this continues!?"
CH8_Main_33_037,"What about the other Draconics?"
CH8_Main_33_038,"Tsk. Their souls were taken."
CH8_Main_33_039,"Was it Infira? He used the souls of his kin to get more power..."
CH8_Main_33_040,"How funny. He has a power similar to mine..."
CH8_Main_33_041,"At least we don't have to worry about the other Draconics going berserk...!"
CH8_Main_33_042,"Isn't Laias losing?"
CH8_Main_33_043,"Infira: Gah hah hah hah! You're just a Blue Dragon, after all!"
CH8_Main_33_044,"Infira: Your combat power is lower than a Red or Black Dragon's!"
CH8_Main_33_045,"Infira: Right now, I'm even stronger than Temeraire or Armarta in their prime...!!"
CH8_Main_33_046,"Infira: No, I could kill just about any dragon now!!!"
CH8_Main_33_047,"Laias: Kuh... With just raw power, I can't...!"
CH8_Main_33_048,"This is bad! Laias alone can't do it!"
CH8_Main_33_049,"Let's join this fight...!"
CH8_Main_33_050,"Even if it's dangerous, we have to do it!"
CH8_Main_33_051,"Yaaaaah!"
CH8_Main_33_052,"Kuhh! Wh-what is this!?"
CH8_Main_33_053,"It's an explosive arrow made from Mad Dragon Svelta's bones!"
CH8_Main_33_054,"Even if you have a dragon's body, this should hurt!"
CH8_Main_33_055,"Kuh, you trash...!"
CH8_Main_33_056,"You think you'll stop me with this!?"
CH8_Main_33_057,"I'll crush you... Ugh!?"
CH8_Main_33_058,"How does it feel, falling for the same attack twice, Draconic!"
CH8_Main_33_059,"You dared to laugh at my flames! Take this!!!"
CH8_Main_33_060,"Kuahhh, the fragments of the castle...!"
CH8_Main_33_061,"Heh heh heh, I've found a weakness!"
CH8_Main_33_062,"...!?! Wh-what's this!!"
CH8_Main_33_063,"Hahaha, you were planning on eating all these souls by yourself?"
CH8_Main_33_064,"Come on. I'll eat them for you!"
CH8_Main_33_065,"Thanks for the food!"
CH8_Main_33_066,"Kuhahaha, it's so fun beating up the big guy!"
CH8_Main_33_067,"I'll rip out your scales!!! I'll tear them all off!"
CH8_Main_33_068,"I'll pulverize every part of you!!"
CH8_Main_33_069,"Ugh, these flies...!"
CH8_Main_33_070,"This is the end, you trash! I'll get rid of you all - Ugh!?!!"
CH8_Main_33_071,"Laias: You're full of openings, Infira!!"
CH8_Main_33_072,"Kyaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_33_073,"Laias: Now, Kasel!"
CH8_Main_33_074,"Kasel: Holy Sword -"
CH8_Main_33_075,"Kasel: Grant me your power!!!"
CH8_Main_33_076,"Infira: ?!"
CH8_Main_33_077,"Infira: You - when did you!!"
CH8_Main_33_078,"Kasel: This opportunity that everyone made for me - "
CH8_Main_33_079,"Kasel: I won't let it go to waste!!!"
CH8_Main_33_080,"Infira: Damn, damn, damn!!!"
CH8_Main_33_081,"Infira: Me, losing to trash like you - "
CH8_Main_33_082,"Kasel: Haaaaaaaa---!!!!"
CH8_Main_33_083,"Kasel: This is the end, Infira!!"
CH8_Main_33_084,"Infira: Graaaaaagh!!!!"
CH8_Main_33_085,"Infira: No... way..."
CH8_Main_33_086,"It's finally over."
CH8_Main_33_087,"Phew... It's been a while since I've used my original form."
CH8_Main_33_088,"Ah... I can't..."
CH8_Main_33_089,"Are you okay?"
CH8_Main_33_090,"Go over there and take a rest"
CH8_Main_33_091,"Wait, something's strange."
CH8_Main_33_092,"I absorbed many souls..."
CH8_Main_33_093,"But I didn't feel anything as powerful as that..."
CH8_Main_33_094,"!!! Everyone, look over there!"
CH8_Main_33_095,"Kuh... I... Can't end like this...!"
CH8_Main_33_096,"He's still alive...!"
CH8_Main_33_097,"It was a direct hit with the Holy Sword...!"
CH8_Main_33_098,"Kuh... If this rift will disappear anyway..."
CH8_Main_33_099,"I'll take you with me...!"
CH8_Main_33_100,"What is he doing to the dimensional rift...?"
CH8_Main_33_101,"If a magic spell is cast on that unstable vortex of evil energy,"
CH8_Main_33_102,"the whole volcano will explode...!"
CH8_Main_33_103,"We have to stop him!"
CH8_Main_33_104,"Kill him!!"
CH8_Main_33_105,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_33_106,"Morrah: So you did get in my way."
CH8_Main_33_107,"Morrah: What did I say, Infira?"
CH8_Main_33_108,"Infira: Kuh...?"
CH8_Main_33_109,"Infira: M-Morrah!?"
CH8_Main_33_110,"Infira: Wh-what are you...?"
CH8_Main_33_111,"?!!"
CH8_Main_33_112,"I told you."
CH8_Main_33_113,"That if you ruined this, I would take your neck."
CH8_Main_33_114,"Ruin...?"
CH8_Main_33_115,"The dimensional rift is a precious resource."
CH8_Main_33_116,"You tried to destroy it."
CH8_Main_33_117,"That was... the Warrior of the Holy Sword...!"
CH8_Main_33_118,"Hahaha."
CH8_Main_33_119,"When did I say that the Warrior of the Holy Sword closed the dimensional rift?"
CH8_Main_33_120,"...!!!"
CH8_Main_33_121,"I only said that the rifts disappeared in every area that they passed by."
CH8_Main_33_122,"Then...!"
CH8_Main_33_123,"Hahaha, you finally understand?"
CH8_Main_33_124,"The dimensional rift is the aggregation of a great power."
CH8_Main_33_125,"Give up that power to Maria."
CH8_Main_33_126,"You're betraying me...!?"
CH8_Main_33_127,"Heh, what a stupid thing to say."
CH8_Main_33_128,"You were my pawn at one point, but that was a long time ago."
CH8_Main_33_129,"I don't follow the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_33_130,"I only follow Maria."
CH8_Main_33_131,"Ugh..."
CH8_Main_33_132,"Die now, Infira."
CH8_Main_33_133,"Everything is for Maria..."
CH8_Main_34_001,"Well, now..."
CH8_Main_34_002,"The dimensional rift is closing down little by little..."
CH8_Main_34_003,"Did he absorb that power and put it in that bead...!?"
CH8_Main_34_004,"But why...?"
CH8_Main_34_005,"Whatever his goal was, wasn't he part of the Dark Legion?"
CH8_Main_34_006,"That's not what's important..."
CH8_Main_34_007,"I wonder... What he wants to do with all that power..."
CH8_Main_34_008,"Shouldn't we stop him?"
CH8_Main_34_009,"It's too late."
CH8_Main_34_010,"Anyway. Now that it's come to this, shouldn't it be safe once the Demons in the desert are eliminated?"
CH8_Main_34_011,"That Theo. He won't have that much work to do now."
CH8_Main_34_012,"I guess that helps..."
CH8_Main_34_013,"Whew."
CH8_Main_34_014,"It's finally over."
CH8_Main_34_015,"Thanks, Warrior of the Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_34_016,"My mission was accomplished more easily, thanks to you."
CH8_Main_34_017,"You used us, Morrah?"
CH8_Main_34_018,"Used you?"
CH8_Main_34_019,"You could say that."
CH8_Main_34_020,"But isn't it good for you that the dimensional rift was closed?"
CH8_Main_34_021,"..."
CH8_Main_34_022,"I have a question, Morrah."
CH8_Main_34_023,"What will you use that great power for?"
CH8_Main_34_024,"I don't have a reason to answer that."
CH8_Main_34_025,"But... Okay, since you helped me, I'll toss you a bone."
CH8_Main_34_026,"If you want to know, come to the swamps of Gargoss."
CH8_Main_34_027,"I'll get going, then."
CH8_Main_34_028,"Since at least one of you seems to want to come at me,"
CH8_Main_34_029,"there's no reason for me to stay here and waste energy."
CH8_Main_34_030,"Tch, you found out."
CH8_Main_34_031,"I didn't get to eat Infira since you killed him,"
CH8_Main_34_032,"so I thought I could take your soul instead."
CH8_Main_34_033,"Sorry, but I've got no reason to fight right now."
CH8_Main_34_034,"Go eat somewhere else."
CH8_Main_34_035,"Bye, then."
CH8_Main_34_036,"Hey! Where are you running off to!?"
CH8_Main_34_037,"You're still hungry after all that!?"
CH8_Main_34_038,"I told you, strong guys are special!"
CH8_Main_34_039,"He looked so delicious, too...!"
CH8_Main_34_040,"*Sigh.* Come on! Learn to be more patient!"
CH8_Main_34_041,"You know, coming from you, that doesn't sound convincing."
CH8_Main_34_042,"What did you just say!?"
CH8_Main_34_043,"Morrah left."
CH8_Main_34_044,"But at least the rift in the volcano is gone."
CH8_Main_34_045,"The activity from the volcano will die down."
CH8_Main_34_046,"Since it was affected by the dimensional rift..."
CH8_Main_34_047,"So, what's everyone planning to do?"
CH8_Main_34_048,"I'll get going."
CH8_Main_34_049,"Now that the volcano is stable, I'll go look for that Succubus."
CH8_Main_34_050,"I'll continue searching around the area."
CH8_Main_34_051,"There are some Draconics left."
CH8_Main_34_052,"But after I'm done eating them... I'll eat Malduk and that Morrah from earlier!"
CH8_Main_34_053,"Hm. I'll go to Phillop and check how Temeraire is."
CH8_Main_34_054,"After that, I'll return to the desert and see how the people there are."
CH8_Main_34_055,"Yanne, what will you do?"
CH8_Main_34_056,"I'll go with you."
CH8_Main_34_057,"I need to find my next job."
CH8_Main_34_058,"It was nice meeting you all."
CH8_Main_34_059,"I'm sure we'll meet again."
CH8_Main_34_060,"Thank you, Laias and Yanne."
CH8_Main_34_061,"We'll see you next time."
CH8_Main_34_062,"What should we do?"
CH8_Main_34_063,"Morrah said... Gargoss?"
CH8_Main_34_064,"I'm worried about that place."
CH8_Main_34_065,"Gargoss... Wasn't it turned into ruins after the Demon War 100 years ago?"
CH8_Main_34_066,"They say the Galluah Plains are now a dead wasteland,"
CH8_Main_34_067,"and the swamps of Gargoss are a cursed land filled with evil and vengeful spirits."
CH8_Main_34_068,"It is also said that it's where Angmund built his castle."
CH8_Main_34_069,"It's a terrible place..."
CH8_Main_34_070,"Well, we'll have to go to Gargoss, since Morrah mentioned it."
CH8_Main_34_071,"If we want to find out even a little about what's behind all this."
CH8_Main_35_001,"Ugh, I smell something rotten..."
CH8_Main_35_002,"It's proof that we're near Gargoss."
CH8_Main_35_003,"There's a rumor that says that even the land is rotting there..."
CH8_Main_35_004,"Shh, stop for a sec."
CH8_Main_35_005,"That is...."
CH8_Main_35_006,"Hahaha, what is it, Maria?"
CH8_Main_35_007,"Didn't you swear loyalty to him?"
CH8_Main_35_008,"It's not like you can't cooperate, right?"
CH8_Main_35_009,"Hmph. It doesn't mean that I have a reason to cooperate with you."
CH8_Main_35_010,"I won't act unless it is an order from the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_35_011,"Oh, I see."
CH8_Main_35_012,"So even though he didn't order it,"
CH8_Main_35_013,"you followed the Warrior of the Holy Sword, egging him on,"
CH8_Main_35_014,"closing the dimensional rifts, ruining the plans of the Dark Legion,"
CH8_Main_35_015,"and planted the seeds of war to create chaos and postpone the occupation of each region."
CH8_Main_35_016,"Were those things all an order from him?"
CH8_Main_35_017,"...What are you talking about?"
CH8_Main_35_018,"There's no use in acting innocent."
CH8_Main_35_019,"You told Lorraine in Elidora about the Nucleus of Darkness."
CH8_Main_35_020,"And you made the Goblins of Ogria stand up against the Orcs to make room for the warrior to enter."
CH8_Main_35_021,"And you sent the traitor Epis to the Galluah Plains."
CH8_Main_35_022,"You used the Gnolls in Arrovina to confuse the Dark Elves,"
CH8_Main_35_023,"and you made the revengeful spirit to remove the mind control on El Rosed..."
CH8_Main_35_024,"And now Infira is dead, the Mad Dragon Temeraire is sealed, and even the dimensional rift is closed."
CH8_Main_35_025,"You really don't know?"
CH8_Main_35_026,"You underestimated me, fallen Saintess."
CH8_Main_35_027,"Isn't that so, Sublime One?"
CH8_Main_35_028,"?!!"
CH8_Main_35_029,"Black... Knight? When...!!"
CH8_Main_35_030,"Sublime One, give the traitor her punishment."
CH8_Main_35_031,"Death to the traitor."
CH8_Main_35_032,"...."
CH8_Main_35_033,"!!!"
CH8_Main_35_034,"Kwaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_35_035,"Morrah!!"
CH8_Main_35_036,"That's... the Black Knight!!"
CH8_Main_35_037,"It's overwhelming..."
CH8_Main_35_038,"Ugh... Just looking at him is making my legs shake...!"
CH8_Main_35_039,"Huh!?"
CH8_Main_35_040,"The Holy Sword is reacting in the direction of the Black Knight...!"
CH8_Main_35_041,"What is going on...?"
CH8_Main_35_042,"Tsk tsk. Even the first Draconic has betrayed me."
CH8_Main_35_043,"He was much better when he was just a vicious soldier."
CH8_Main_35_044,"Shut... up!"
CH8_Main_35_045,"Is it because you ate the Holy Dragon Oricana when the warrior came to kill the Dark Lord?"
CH8_Main_35_046,"The blessed ancient Red Dragon that served Saintess Maria...!"
CH8_Main_35_047,"Yes, that was it."
CH8_Main_35_048,"You removed its heart and had its blood."
CH8_Main_35_049,"I said, shut up, Malduk!!!!"
CH8_Main_35_050,"Kugh..."
CH8_Main_35_051,"Hahaha, Draconics were made to eat dragons and take their powers."
CH8_Main_35_052,"They're just weapons that resembled the dragons they ate. Infira and Kallax were good examples."
CH8_Main_35_053,"But you couldn't absorb the powerful Oricana's soul, so you made it part of yourself."
CH8_Main_35_054,"And by meeting Maria, it accepted you as well!!"
CH8_Main_35_055,"Ha ha... Hahaha... How come I didn't know?"
CH8_Main_35_056,"I had such a good experiment subject in front of my eyes!!"
CH8_Main_35_057,"A complete fusion of a Draconic and a dragon!"
CH8_Main_35_058,"Holy Dragon Oricana..."
CH8_Main_35_059,"The dragon of a nameless priestess... She was known as the priestess of dragons and was a comrade of King Kyle...!"
CH8_Main_35_060,"Then... The nameless priestess that helped King Kyle 100 years ago is... Priestess Maria!?!"
CH8_Main_35_061,"I thought that Maria and Morrah were part of the Dark Legion...!!"
CH8_Main_35_062,"So what they've done so far... is to ruin the plans of the Dark Legion!?"
CH8_Main_35_063,"Tsk. What a turn of events. Everything we've known so far has been turned upside-down."
CH8_Main_35_064,"A-anyway, we must go help them...!"
CH8_Main_35_065,"Y-you think we can win against that thing?"
CH8_Main_35_066,"Malduk is there, too!"
CH8_Main_35_067,"Honestly, I don't think we can win..."
CH8_Main_35_068,"But we need to try at least...!"
CH8_Main_35_069,"Kasel...!!"
CH8_Main_35_070,"Ugh, that idiot!!"
CH8_Main_35_071,"I agree... But he's right, we have to help. Let's go!"
CH8_Main_35_072,"Then, die here. Maria."
CH8_Main_35_073,"....!"
CH8_Main_35_074,"That is...!?"
CH8_Main_35_075,"Malduk! Black Knight! Stop there!"
CH8_Main_35_076,"Don't you dare lay a finger on them!"
CH8_Main_35_077,"...Holy Sword!?"
CH8_Main_35_078,"N-no! If you fight the Black Knight now...!"
CH8_Main_35_079,"..."
CH8_Main_35_080,"The Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_35_081,"?!"
CH8_Main_35_082,"Holy Sword... Holy Sword..."
CH8_Main_35_083,"Holy Sword... Lua... Lua!!!"
CH8_Main_35_084,"Die, dog of Lua..."
CH8_Main_35_085,"Kyaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_35_086,"Th-this power...!!"
CH8_Main_35_087,"Kuh...! It's too great..."
CH8_Main_35_088,"The power... in my body...!!"
CH8_Main_35_089,"The shield was destroyed in one hit..."
CH8_Main_35_090,"Get lost!!"
CH8_Main_35_091,"That's it!!"
CH8_Main_35_092,"Kuh!!"
CH8_Main_35_093,"Haaa!!"
CH8_Main_35_094,"Tsk. I aimed for his head, but it did nothing...!"
CH8_Main_35_095,"An Angel."
CH8_Main_35_096,"Another dog of Lua..."
CH8_Main_35_097,"That's it, Dark Lord Kyle."
CH8_Main_35_098,"I won't let the second Warrior of the Holy Sword die at your hands."
CH8_Main_35_099,"The Holy Sword is no longer yours."
CH8_Main_35_100,"You think a mere Angel can stop me?"
CH8_Main_35_101,"Hm. Don't make me laugh."
CH8_Main_35_102,"Dark Lord Kyle!?"
CH8_Main_35_103,"Kyle, the Warrior of the Holy Sword from 100 years ago!?!"
CH8_Main_35_104,"The Warrior of the Holy Sword is the Dark Lord!?"
CH8_Main_35_105,"What is going on...!?"
CH8_Main_35_106,"That's King Kyle,"
CH8_Main_35_107,"my... father...?"
CH8_Main_35_108,"..."
CH8_Main_35_109,"The Warrior of the Holy Sword, and even an Angel have appeared."
CH8_Main_35_110,"Sublime One, may I suggest we retreat."
CH8_Main_35_111,"We can get rid of the Warrior of the Holy Sword anytime."
CH8_Main_35_112,"It's not time yet."
CH8_Main_35_113,"Of course, you must feel angered... But it is not time yet."
CH8_Main_35_114,"..."
CH8_Main_35_115,"Malduk, if you say so..."
CH8_Main_35_116,"I'll do as you say."
CH8_Main_35_117,"But..."
CH8_Main_35_118,"There won't be a next time."
CH8_Main_35_119,"..."
CH8_Main_35_120,"Father... Huh..."
CH9_Main_0,"King's Raid"
CH9_Main_0_1,"Pandemonium"
CH9_Main_1_1,"Are you... angels?"
CH9_Main_1_2,"Think what you want."
CH9_Main_1_3,"We are beings that only exist to serve Lua."
CH9_Main_1_4,"Thank you."
CH9_Main_1_5,"Do not be mistaken. We did not save you."
CH9_Main_1_6,"We were only concerned about the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_1_7,"Human, you may have been chosen by Lua."
CH9_Main_1_8,"But you must never fight Dark Lord Kyle, not when your power is this weak."
CH9_Main_1_9,"I can't argue against that."
CH9_Main_1_10,"His power was truly great."
CH9_Main_1_11,"Hmph, if the Holy Sword was complete, things would have been different."
CH9_Main_1_12,"...The completed Holy Sword..."
CH9_Main_1_13,"You are also a convict who has turned away from Lua."
CH9_Main_1_14,"You may live for now, but you will receive judgment soon."
CH9_Main_1_15,"Who gave you the right!?"
CH9_Main_1_16,"Even if you have assimilated with the soul of the Holy Dragon, you are still an inferior dragon."
CH9_Main_1_17,"Know your place."
CH9_Main_1_18,"Enough."
CH9_Main_1_19,"Who are you, anyway?"
CH9_Main_1_20,"I am Frey, a priestess from the Church of Lua."
CH9_Main_1_21,"..."
CH9_Main_1_22,"A religious group that believes in the goddess... and wields her power."
CH9_Main_1_23,"Yes, we follow Lua and use her powers to create a better world."
CH9_Main_1_24,"..."
CH9_Main_1_25,"No, I'm not talking to you."
CH9_Main_1_26,"??"
CH9_Main_1_27,"You may be looking for an opportunity while hiding in there, but you will not succeed."
CH9_Main_1_28,"What? I don't understand."
CH9_Main_1_29,"Enough. We have delayed for too long, Arch."
CH9_Main_1_30,"Very well."
CH9_Main_1_31,"We will take down the Dark Lord."
CH9_Main_1_32,"So, do not try to challenge him again. You're just not strong enough."
CH9_Main_1_33,"Master of the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_1_34,"If this is the will of Lua, we must follow it."
CH9_Main_1_35,"However, human beings are too unpredictable."
CH9_Main_1_36,"Do not act so recklessly, as you have done last time."
CH9_Main_1_37,"Don't act so recklessly? Come on!"
CH9_Main_1_38,"Bleh! Snobs!"
CH9_Main_1_39,"Lua's... dogs..."
CH9_Main_2_1,"Anyway, this is the Swamps of Gargoss."
CH9_Main_2_2,"And..."
CH9_Main_2_3,"..."
CH9_Main_2_4,"..."
CH9_Main_2_5,"Kasel."
CH9_Main_2_6,"Are you all right?"
CH9_Main_2_7,"You're the kid with the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_2_8,"..."
CH9_Main_2_9,"Those angels were right. I don't understand why you acted so recklessly."
CH9_Main_2_10,"Hey, we helped you!"
CH9_Main_2_11,"..."
CH9_Main_2_12,"I knew it was rash of me to do that, but I couldn't just ignore someone in trouble."
CH9_Main_2_13,"...Hmph."
CH9_Main_2_14,"So, you did it for me? Hah! You're the Master of the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_2_15,"And you risked losing the Holy Sword because of your sympathy?"
CH9_Main_2_16,"Hah hah... This is exactly why I can't trust so-called heroes..."
CH9_Main_2_17,"Hey!"
CH9_Main_2_18,"That's enough. Regardless of what happened, we risked our lives for you."
CH9_Main_2_19,"We're not asking for gratitude, but you are being very rude. You've crossed the line."
CH9_Main_2_20,"..."
CH9_Main_2_21,"Kasel."
CH9_Main_2_22,"Maria, the Holy Sword's power must be very important."
CH9_Main_2_23,"Well, that doesn't matter to me."
CH9_Main_2_24,"If I was holding back in fear of losing the Holy Sword..."
CH9_Main_2_25,"And if I had been fighting while worrying about things like that, I wouldn't have stepped up to save you this time."
CH9_Main_2_26,"It's not the Holy Sword itself that's important."
CH9_Main_2_27,"It's my heart and will that matters. I've come to realize that traveling with everyone."
CH9_Main_2_28,"Yes, I am only able to keep going because of all of you."
CH9_Main_2_29,"Thank you, everyone."
CH9_Main_2_30,"Maria."
CH9_Main_2_31,"I'm very glad... to have you by my side."
CH9_Main_2_32,"!!"
CH9_Main_2_33,"Hey, where are you going!?"
CH9_Main_2_34,"There's something over there that can neutralize Dark Lord Kyle's powers."
CH9_Main_2_35,"And my goal is to find it to complete the power of the rift."
CH9_Main_2_36,"A power that can... neutralize Dark Lord Kyle's powers?"
CH9_Main_2_37,"That place is..."
CH9_Main_2_38,"It's the ruins of the Ancient Kingdom. It's also the Dark Lord's Castle where Kyle and Dark Lord Angmund fought their final battle."
CH9_Main_2_39,"The Dark Lord's Castle..."
CH9_Main_2_40,"Let's move."
CH9_Main_2_41,"Kasel."
CH9_Main_2_42,"There is a clue over there. And a solution."
CH9_Main_2_43,"You actually believe that woman?"
CH9_Main_2_44,"Whether we can trust her or not doesn't matter."
CH9_Main_2_45,"If there's any chance I can take, then I'll have to take it."
CH9_Main_2_46,"Yes, I agree with you."
CH9_Main_2_47,"Okay. But Frey, I want you to stay right next to me! I'll protect you."
CH9_Main_2_48,"Thank you, Cleo."
CH9_Main_2_49,"Hmph, are we done talking now?"
CH9_Main_2_50,"You'll find out soon enough how ugly Lua truly is."
CH9_Main_2_51,"That's why I'm taking you all with me. Just to show you the truth."
CH9_Main_2_52,"I'm definitely going to throw a fireball at that woman later..."
CH9_Main_3_1,"Kasel, do you have a moment?"
CH9_Main_3_2,"Yes?"
CH9_Main_3_3,"I've been trying to tell you for a while, but I just couldn't find the right moment."
CH9_Main_3_4,"What did you want to tell me?"
CH9_Main_3_5,"Back at the Snowy Mountain, I..."
CH9_Main_3_6,"..."
CH9_Main_3_7,"I'm sorry. No matter how dire the situation was, I should've acted more carefully."
CH9_Main_3_8,"Roi..."
CH9_Main_3_9,"Please forgive me for only apologizing now, after making you suffer through all that."
CH9_Main_3_10,"..."
CH9_Main_3_11,"You don't have to do that, Roi."
CH9_Main_3_12,"..."
CH9_Main_3_13,"I was so flustered and confused at the time."
CH9_Main_3_14,"And I just can't get my mother out of my head after that day."
CH9_Main_3_15,"Honestly, it's been so painful."
CH9_Main_3_16,"That might be the reason why I've never brought it up."
CH9_Main_3_17,"But I had a feeling that you wanted to talk about this for a while, Roi."
CH9_Main_3_18,"Kasel... I knew I should have said something back then..."
CH9_Main_3_19,"No..."
CH9_Main_3_20,"I should be the one to apologize."
CH9_Main_3_21,"??"
CH9_Main_3_22,"I knew that Frey and Cleo were also avoiding the subject."
CH9_Main_3_23,"I knew that everyone's been suffering because of this..."
CH9_Main_3_24,"But I was too afraid to talk about it. Even when I knew that ignoring this would make things even more difficult for you all."
CH9_Main_3_25,"Kasel..."
CH9_Main_3_26,"Thank you.."
CH9_Main_3_27,"for bringing up a difficult conversation.."
CH9_Main_3_28,"and for apologizing first."
CH9_Main_3_29,"..."
CH9_Main_3_30,"You might think I'm weird for taking this so calmly."
CH9_Main_3_31,"But I decided to accept it."
CH9_Main_3_32,"My mother already passed away..."
CH9_Main_3_33,"when she chose to sacrifice herself to get me out of that village during my childhood."
CH9_Main_3_34,"So, it's fine now."
CH9_Main_3_35,"Kasel..."
CH9_Main_3_36,"You don't have to blame yourself."
CH9_Main_3_37,"The bigger problem right now is him."
CH9_Main_3_38,"King Kyle..."
CH9_Main_3_39,"Kasel's father..."
CH9_Main_3_40,"Back at Snow Mountain, I talked with Pavel about my mother."
CH9_Main_3_41,"About what kind of person he knew her as... and her relationship with him..."
CH9_Main_3_42,"I learned some new information, though they're in bits and pieces."
CH9_Main_3_43,"He didn't tell me too many details."
CH9_Main_3_44,"It seemed like he was hesitant to tell me some of the stories because of the truths we learned back at the Volcano."
CH9_Main_3_45,"And that's why... I have a different view about her now."
CH9_Main_3_46,"You mean that woman? Maria?"
CH9_Main_3_47,"She was one of the heroes that fought alongside King Kyle... The Saintess of Brilliance."
CH9_Main_3_48,"I'm still not really sure whether or not she's actually the same person."
CH9_Main_3_49,"But in the end, it is true that her actions have helped us out."
CH9_Main_3_50,"What Malduk said really hit me hard."
CH9_Main_3_51,"I can't believe she's done all that behind the scenes..."
CH9_Main_3_52,"I still don't like it! Did you forget already?"
CH9_Main_3_53,"She never gave us a straight answer and kept luring us into traps."
CH9_Main_3_54,"She relied on and admired Kyle more than anyone else."
CH9_Main_3_55,"Just like Frey, who's unafraid of sacrificing herself for you."
CH9_Main_3_56,"Let's just wait it out. I'm sure she has her reasons."
CH9_Main_3_57,"Frey?"
CH9_Main_3_58,"Huh?"
CH9_Main_3_59,"What's wrong? You seem a bit out of it."
CH9_Main_3_60,"Ah, was I?"
CH9_Main_3_61,"She's probably just a bit tired!"
CH9_Main_3_62,"And this place is so creepy... It looks like it's haunted."
CH9_Main_3_63,"Ah hah hah, can we not talk about ghosts?"
CH9_Main_4_1,"I hope this isn't another trap."
CH9_Main_4_2,"..."
CH9_Main_4_3,"Are you sure there's something here?"
CH9_Main_4_4,"I mean, it's shady enough that this place contains some power related to the Dimension Rift."
CH9_Main_4_5,"Everything you say is just so hard to believe!"
CH9_Main_4_6,"..."
CH9_Main_4_7,"Hey, lady! Say something!"
CH9_Main_4_8,"Stop babbling like a child. If you're that creeped out, you can just turn back."
CH9_Main_4_9,"Why you...!"
CH9_Main_4_10,"And how do you know my mom?"
CH9_Main_4_11,"Why do you keep asking me about your mother?"
CH9_Main_4_12,"Uggh..."
CH9_Main_4_13,"Morrah!?"
CH9_Main_4_14,"I-I'm fine..."
CH9_Main_4_15,"This wound..."
CH9_Main_4_16,"Is it from the Black Knight?"
CH9_Main_4_17,"I knew something was wrong when you were knocked away from that hit."
CH9_Main_4_18,"Shut up, you inferior fools."
CH9_Main_4_19,"What!? Hey!"
CH9_Main_4_20,"Cleo, stop it."
CH9_Main_4_21,"..."
CH9_Main_4_22,"...Why didn't you say anything?"
CH9_Main_4_23,"You don't have to worry."
CH9_Main_4_24,"Lua, my Lord..."
CH9_Main_4_25,"...!?"
CH9_Main_4_26,"Why...?"
CH9_Main_4_27,"The two of you definitely don't get along with us. However, I am a priestess of Lua."
CH9_Main_4_28,"I can't just ignore someone with such a terrible wound."
CH9_Main_4_29,"I insisted that I couldn't heal Naila's sister because she was possessed too strongly by the demonic power."
CH9_Main_4_30,"However, because of my own shortcoming immaturity, that left a scar in Naila."
CH9_Main_4_31,"I promised to myself I'd never act like such a hypocrite again."
CH9_Main_4_32,"...Even if I have to sacrifice my own life."
CH9_Main_4_33,"Don't say that! You already did something like that back at Snow Mountain!"
CH9_Main_4_34,"I also feel terrible whenever I think of that moment..."
CH9_Main_4_35,"Yes, you say that you were just keeping your cool, but you should also be careful not to show unconditional mercy to your enemies."
CH9_Main_4_36,"What happened to Naila was unfortunate..."
CH9_Main_4_37,"But you're right."
CH9_Main_4_38,"Himmullis, was it? That harpy was already tainted by the darkness."
CH9_Main_4_39,"Just like the Queen of Harpies."
CH9_Main_4_40,"If you had healed her out of sympathy, you would have been put in a more difficult situation."
CH9_Main_4_41,"No, even so, I should have still healed her."
CH9_Main_4_42,"Regrets don't change anything... But..."
CH9_Main_4_43,"You're trying to move forward by facing them..."
CH9_Main_4_44,"Maria..."
CH9_Main_4_45,"Anyways, thank you."
CH9_Main_4_46,"Morrah, are you okay now?"
CH9_Main_4_47,"...Yes, I feel a lot better now. But..."
CH9_Main_4_48,"But?"
CH9_Main_4_49,"N-No, never mind."
CH9_Main_4_50,"..."
CH9_Main_4_51,"..."
CH9_Main_4_52,"..."
CH9_Main_4_53,"!?"
CH9_Main_4_54,"(Is it just my imagination?)"
CH9_Main_5_1,"Father..."
CH9_Main_5_1_1,"You've changed."
CH9_Main_5_1_2,"Yes..."
CH9_Main_5_1_3,"If we keep going like this, and with Maria's powers... we could..."
CH9_Main_5_1_4,"No, unless the Holy Sword is complete, it would be futile to fight against him."
CH9_Main_5_1_5,"Don't cry, Maria..."
CH9_Main_5_1_6,"Please take care of her..."
CH9_Main_5_1_7,"Welcome the coming of a new, beautiful age with everyone..."
CH9_Main_5_1_8,"Become... their hope."
CH9_Main_5_1_9,"Kyle..."
CH9_Main_5_1_10,"He... failed... even with the completed Holy Sword..."
CH9_Main_6_1,"Be careful, everyone! This one is different!"
CH9_Main_6_1_1,"Watch out, Frey!"
CH9_Main_6_1_2,"Ahh!"
CH9_Main_6_1_3,"Haa!"
CH9_Main_6_1_4,"!!"
CH9_Main_6_2_1,"Raven Storm!"
CH9_Main_6_2_2,"Now!"
CH9_Main_6_2_3,"Haaaa!"
CH9_Main_6_2_4,"Ah..."
CH9_Main_6_2_5,"..."
CH9_Main_7_1,"We need to admit that Kasel's power is much stronger than before."
CH9_Main_7_2,"He is completely different from what he was like at the Volcano."
CH9_Main_7_3,"Is it really possible to get that much stronger, just by changing your attitude?"
CH9_Main_7_4,"The Holy Sword is an artifact that follows its master's will. As Kasel's heart grows stronger, the Holy Sword will get stronger as well."
CH9_Main_7_5,"Oh, that's right... The fairy at the World Tree said something like that before. Well, as long as the Holy Sword is completed, that Dark Lord dude is done for!"
CH9_Main_7_6,"I mean, Mr. Dark Lord? What am I supposed to call him? He's Kasel's father..."
CH9_Main_7_7,"..."
CH9_Main_7_8,"..."
CH9_Main_7_9,"Well, it looks like the angels weren't lying about the Holy Sword's incredible power once it's completed."
CH9_Main_7_10,"It can even make the Dark Lord look like a joke."
CH9_Main_7_11,"We just need one more Holy Sword fragment, right?"
CH9_Main_7_12,"Yes, Kaulah has the last fragment."
CH9_Main_7_13,"Why don't we go back and look for it now?"
CH9_Main_7_14,"No, it looks like Kasel made up his mind."
CH9_Main_7_15,"Even if it's not related to the fight against the Dark Lord, he wants to solve the problem at hand right now."
CH9_Main_7_16,"He's really grown from a glutton he used to be..."
CH9_Main_7_17,"..."
CH9_Main_7_18,"...Ah hah hah..."
CH9_Main_7_1_1,"That priestess, Frey..."
CH9_Main_7_1_2,"Something feels off about her."
CH9_Main_7_1_3,"What do you mean?"
CH9_Main_7_1_4,"When she cured my wounds..."
CH9_Main_7_1_5,"I don't know if all priest healings are like this..."
CH9_Main_7_1_6,"But this weird energy came out from her."
CH9_Main_7_1_7,"Weird energy? What do you mean?"
CH9_Main_7_1_8,"The energy I felt when I became one with the Holy Dragon. I felt the exact opposite from her power."
CH9_Main_7_1_9,"A power that opposes Lua..."
CH9_Main_7_1_10,"A demonic power..."
CH9_Main_7_1_11,"..."
CH9_Main_7_1_12,"Actually.. let's just see what happens for now."
CH9_Main_8_1,"Whew... Looks like everything's taken care of here."
CH9_Main_8_2,"And those two were the ones who did it quickest without leaving anything behind."
CH9_Main_8_3,"They would have definitely been a tough enemy to face..."
CH9_Main_8_4,"Hah hah! My dear brother and sister!"
CH9_Main_8_5,"Clause!"
CH9_Main_8_6,"Clause!"
CH9_Main_8_7,"I finally caught up to you!"
CH9_Main_8_8,"How did you find us here?"
CH9_Main_8_9,"It's not hard to track down someone with the kingdom's help."
CH9_Main_8_10,"Especially, when I'm looking for such a unique group of people that have been walking through remarkable paths."
CH9_Main_8_11,"!?"
CH9_Main_8_12,"You guys are!?"
CH9_Main_8_13,"Clause, wait!"
CH9_Main_8_14,"You're that petty knight from Orvelia."
CH9_Main_8_15,"Kasel... What's going on?"
CH9_Main_8_16,"Why are you traveling with those people?"
CH9_Main_8_17,"Just calm down and listen to me..."
CH9_Main_8_18,"They attacked the Guardian Knights of Orvel."
CH9_Main_8_19,"But you're saying they're not enemies? What do you mean?"
CH9_Main_8_20,"Did you forget that you almost died as well back then?"
CH9_Main_8_21,"That's true... but things have changed. Just listen."
CH9_Main_8_22,"Clause, lower your sword."
CH9_Main_8_23,"!?"
CH9_Main_8_24,"Very well."
CH9_Main_8_25,"Huh? She's..."
CH9_Main_8_26,"She must be..."
CH9_Main_8_27,"This is Princess Scarlet, the 1st successor in line for the throne of Orvelia."
CH9_Main_8_28,"Princess Scarlet..."
CH9_Main_8_29,"I'm telling you now, but do not kneel in front of me."
CH9_Main_8_30,"Oh, um... Okay..."
CH9_Main_8_31,"But this is just a very awkward spot to be in..."
CH9_Main_8_32,"Yeah... I never knew how hard it would be to not kneel when royalty is before me..."
CH9_Main_8_33,"You must be the Warrior of the Holy Sword, Kasel..."
CH9_Main_8_34,"I am no hero."
CH9_Main_8_35,"I have come out here to meet you."
CH9_Main_8_36,"But it looks like you'll have to explain this situation first."
CH9_Main_8_37,"He doesn't usually pull out his sword so rashly."
CH9_Main_8_38,"Princess..."
CH9_Main_8_39,"She is one of the heroes that fought against Dark Lord Angmund along with King Kyle 100 years ago."
CH9_Main_8_40,"..."
CH9_Main_8_41,"Maria the Saintess of Dragon."
CH9_Main_8_42,"What?"
CH9_Main_8_43,"A hero from 100 years ago!?"
CH9_Main_8_44,"So, she's the nameless saintess?"
CH9_Main_8_45,"The one whose existence the Church of Lua purposely hid?"
CH9_Main_8_46,"But..."
CH9_Main_8_47,"You once brought peace upon the kingdom by defeating the Dark Lord..."
CH9_Main_8_48,"But why did you attack the soldiers of Orvelia?"
CH9_Main_8_49,"Hmph, did any of those cowards who ran away from her attack die?"
CH9_Main_8_50,"...!?"
CH9_Main_8_51,"You all worked together to save the World Tree of your own accord to occupy the area."
CH9_Main_8_52,"You never realized that your actions only aggravated the Dark Lord."
CH9_Main_8_53,"That means you would have never realized that she actually saved your lives."
CH9_Main_8_54,"Huh!? Then, she really wasn't trying to kill us back then?"
CH9_Main_8_55,"...Think whatever you want."
CH9_Main_8_56,"Very well. Although I did not hear all of the details,"
CH9_Main_8_57,"I can already tell that you are not our enemy."
CH9_Main_8_58,"Especially when you are one of the heroes that fought against Dark Lord Angmund along with King Kyle 100 years ago..."
CH9_Main_8_59,"But why were you working with the Dark Legion?"
CH9_Main_8_60,"I guard the Princess. Move and you will die."
CH9_Main_8_61,"Interesting! A mere human would dare..."
CH9_Main_8_62,"...Wait. You're not human."
CH9_Main_8_63,"Stand back, Chase. The Princess is speaking."
CH9_Main_8_64,"..."
CH9_Main_8_65,"Yes, it looks like we have exactly the right thing here for the situation."
CH9_Main_8_66,"Perhaps he predicted this would happen when he handed it over to us..."
CH9_Main_8_67,"??"
CH9_Main_8_68,"We brought this."
CH9_Main_8_69,"This is..."
CH9_Main_8_70,"It's Aeatola's Talisman."
CH9_Main_8_71,"It's one of the artifacts that holds a portion of the Holy Sword's power."
CH9_Main_8_72,"The Orc Chieftain Kaulah gave it to us, saying that you were going to need this."
CH9_Main_8_73,"You already met with Kaulah?"
CH9_Main_8_74,"We followed you here by tracking your path. We ran into a lot of people."
CH9_Main_8_75,"As expected of Mr. Kaulah."
CH9_Main_8_76,"So, this is Aeatola's Talisman..."
CH9_Main_8_77,"This is the first time I've seen it."
CH9_Main_8_78,"But we don't know how to fuse the power of the Holy Sword with just this."
CH9_Main_8_79,"Yes... Aeatola..."
CH9_Main_8_80,"...?"
CH9_Main_8_81,"How did you...?"
CH9_Main_8_82,"This should be more than enough to prove yourself."
CH9_Main_8_83,"The ones that divided the power of the Holy Sword should naturally know how to restore it."
CH9_Main_8_84,"That means that your story is holding up to be true."
CH9_Main_8_85,"She's really smart... I guess that's what it takes to be a princess."
CH9_Main_8_86,"Shh."
CH9_Main_8_87,"I have come out here to meet you and find what I lack."
CH9_Main_8_88,"I wish to fight alongside you to hear your stories and learn from them..."
CH9_Main_8_1_1,"Kasel, before you go..."
CH9_Main_8_1_2,"Hmm?"
CH9_Main_8_1_3,"As I told you before, we tracked you down by following your path."
CH9_Main_8_1_4,"Along the way, we were able to meet with a lot of people. Naila, the leader of the Harpies."
CH9_Main_8_1_5,"Kaulah, the just and rightful Chieftain of the Orcs."
CH9_Main_8_1_6,"Epigael and her brother, who gave us a warm greeting, even though they are Dark Elves."
CH9_Main_8_1_7,"They were especially sad, not being able to follow us to meet you."
CH9_Main_8_1_8,"We didn't run into Pavel at the Snowy Mountain, but we were lucky enough to talk with the brave Barbarian Gau."
CH9_Main_8_1_9,"We also met up with Laias and her party, the ones who fought along with you at the Volcano."
CH9_Main_8_1_10,"Finally, we ran into the King of Dwarves, Phillop, a warrior from 100 years ago."
CH9_Main_8_1_11,"You really met up with all of them."
CH9_Main_8_1_12,"Hah hah, I'm glad to hear that they're doing well."
CH9_Main_8_1_13,"I am really proud of you, Kasel."
CH9_Main_8_1_14,"I am really, truly, proud of you."
CH9_Main_8_1_15,"Clause..."
CH9_Main_8_1_16,"The little punk who would always cause trouble back at the orphanage grew up to become the Warrior of the Holy Sword..."
CH9_Main_8_1_17,"On the other hand, I was always upset. I failed to be by your side after giving you such a heavy burden."
CH9_Main_8_1_18,"I was also worried about whether or not you could handle the responsibility of being the Warrior of the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_8_1_19,"But I was wrong."
CH9_Main_8_1_20,"That's why I'm so thankful."
CH9_Main_8_1_21,"Clause..."
CH9_Main_8_1_22,"Warrior of the Holy Sword, Kasel, I have seen the path you have walked."
CH9_Main_8_1_23,"The Warrior who appears to oppose the Dark Lord. The chosen master of the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_8_1_24,"It must have been so difficult."
CH9_Main_8_1_25,"I can't imagine how scary and hard it must have been."
CH9_Main_8_1_26,"Thank you for overcoming all that hardship to be with me right now."
CH9_Main_8_1_27,"..."
CH9_Main_8_1_28,"But Kasel, feel free to lean on me anytime."
CH9_Main_8_1_29,"If you ever need my help, I'll do everything I can to protect you."
CH9_Main_8_1_30,"Clause..."
CH9_Main_8_1_31,"It's written on your face."
CH9_Main_8_1_32,"Hah hah..."
CH9_Main_8_1_33,"That's enough boring, big brother talk."
CH9_Main_8_1_34,"Frey must be worried about us. Let's get going."
CH9_Main_8_1_35,"Clause."
CH9_Main_8_1_36,"Hmm?"
CH9_Main_8_1_37,"Thank you..."
CH9_Main_8_1_38,"Kasel, you don't have to shoulder all the responsibility. Frey and I will always be on your side."
CH9_Main_9_1,"So, we're going with the Princess?"
CH9_Main_9_2,"If we go with her party, we can safely say that nothing will stop us from achieving Maria's goals."
CH9_Main_9_3,"Ugh... Still... This is going to be kind of awkward."
CH9_Main_9_4,"But, that buff guy was incredible!"
CH9_Main_9_5,"He was literally about to run into Morrah without even blinking!"
CH9_Main_9_6,"That's true. Seeing him cut loose like that even made me flinch a little."
CH9_Main_9_7,"One of them is the master and of Orvelia's Guardian Knights that protects the capital, and the other one is next in line for that position."
CH9_Main_9_8,"Some say that the Princess is even stronger than those two."
CH9_Main_9_9,"I shouldn't be saying this, but I'm fairly certain of that."
CH9_Main_9_10,"???"
CH9_Main_9_11,"They're monsters, all of them."
CH9_Main_9_12,"Well, we'll see more of what they can do this time."
CH9_Main_9_1_1,"Roi was right..."
CH9_Main_9_1_2,"Huh? What do you mean?"
CH9_Main_9_1_3,"About how they're monsters."
CH9_Main_9_1_4,"I really shouldn't be saying this about a Princess..."
CH9_Main_9_1_5,"Hah hah, but these people really are crazy strong..."
CH9_Main_9_1_6,"..."
CH9_Main_9_1_7,"I couldn't agree more."
CH9_Main_9_2_1,"The wind is growing colder."
CH9_Main_9_2_2,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_3,"I only expected darkness and gloom, but it's surprising to see such a beautiful place here."
CH9_Main_9_2_4,"Countless souls are resting in this place."
CH9_Main_9_2_5,"We created this place in hopes of helping those souls rest in peace, by blocking off the demonic power."
CH9_Main_9_2_6,"I've heard a little about you and my father from Pavel."
CH9_Main_9_2_7,"That stupid Ice Dragon... He said he wasn't going to intervene anymore..."
CH9_Main_9_2_8,"Did you lose all of your powers as a saintess now?"
CH9_Main_9_2_9,"Yes."
CH9_Main_9_2_10,"But you were once called the Saintess of Brilliance."
CH9_Main_9_2_11,"Hah hah... A nickname like that is pretty meaningless."
CH9_Main_9_2_12,"Lua..."
CH9_Main_9_2_13,"To be honest, I despise Lua."
CH9_Main_9_2_14,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_15,"And I also think it's pathetic for all of you to obsess over that Lua."
CH9_Main_9_2_16,"How much did you hear from Pavel?"
CH9_Main_9_2_17,"The brief meeting between the heroes of the past and my... father..."
CH9_Main_9_2_18,"The fight against the Dark Lord... and the relationship between my mother and your father... but..."
CH9_Main_9_2_19,"He didn't tell me that my father was the Black Knight."
CH9_Main_9_2_20,"Yes... I suspected as much..."
CH9_Main_9_2_21,"The Holy Sword granted by her... Lua's power."
CH9_Main_9_2_22,"The one with the fate to defeat the Dark Lord and bring peace to this land."
CH9_Main_9_2_23,"Yes, the story about Kyle and us is understandable..."
CH9_Main_9_2_24,"But he probably wasn't sure about whether or not you could handle the last part of the story."
CH9_Main_9_2_25,"Honestly... It was hard to believe it. I'm still feeling confused."
CH9_Main_9_2_26,"I can honestly understand why Pavel was so hesitant about not telling me the truth."
CH9_Main_9_2_27,"Yes... Of course... I understand..."
CH9_Main_9_2_28,"He may look cold on the outside, but he is actually very compassionate."
CH9_Main_9_2_29,"He just doesn't realize it himself."
CH9_Main_9_2_30,"I'm sure... he's gotten real sick of this world."
CH9_Main_9_2_31,"After all, the hero who was supposed to bring peace to this world..."
CH9_Main_9_2_32,"turned into another Dark Lord who is trying to destroy this world."
CH9_Main_9_2_33,"And now his son is destined to carry the Holy Sword once again to kill his father."
CH9_Main_9_2_34,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_35,"King Kyle... No, my father... Why did he become the Black Knight?"
CH9_Main_9_2_36,"I heard that he actually defeated Angmund to bring peace to this world 100 years ago."
CH9_Main_9_2_37,"But then why... has he turned into the Dark Lord to put an end to us?"
CH9_Main_9_2_38,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_39,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_40,"Kyle was thoroughly abused."
CH9_Main_9_2_41,"By that so-called goddess called Lua..."
CH9_Main_9_2_42,"!?"
CH9_Main_9_2_43,"She does not deserve to be called a god."
CH9_Main_9_2_44,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_45,"What kind of a god would abandon the person who sacrificed himself to overcome all of the trials she gave out and complete his ultimate mission?"
CH9_Main_9_2_46,"He too, probably didn't expect you to be the reason why Lua abandoned him."
CH9_Main_9_2_47,"I was the reason?"
CH9_Main_9_2_48,"What do you mean?"
CH9_Main_9_2_49,"...I hated her."
CH9_Main_9_2_50,"It didn't matter that I wasn't the one he chose in the end."
CH9_Main_9_2_51,"I thought I could endure everything as long as he was happy."
CH9_Main_9_2_52,"There wasn't much I could have done for him as a saintess."
CH9_Main_9_2_53,"Things would have been different if he had reached out to me,"
CH9_Main_9_2_54,"but I was nothing more than a good comrade to him..."
CH9_Main_9_2_55,"But I was still happy to be by his side..."
CH9_Main_9_2_56,"But everything changed soon after that."
CH9_Main_9_2_57,"Yes, I started hating someone."
CH9_Main_9_2_58,"As a saintess, I was not supposed to hate anyone."
CH9_Main_9_2_59,"But I started hating your mother as soon as I met her."
CH9_Main_9_2_60,"The woman Kyle once loved so much..."
CH9_Main_9_2_61,"Not only did the two of them become reunited, just like in a fairy tale,"
CH9_Main_9_2_62,"but your mother also filled me with envy and jealousy by choosing the path of love without hesitation. It was something that I wasn't able to do."
CH9_Main_9_2_63,"Yes, I was the one who wanted to stay by his side the most."
CH9_Main_9_2_64,"But even if I stayed next to him, I couldn't do anything for him."
CH9_Main_9_2_65,"Maria..."
CH9_Main_9_2_66,"Kyle kept fighting..."
CH9_Main_9_2_67,"To protect the world..."
CH9_Main_9_2_68,"To protect us..."
CH9_Main_9_2_69,"To protect her..."
CH9_Main_9_2_70,"And to protect you, who was just about to be born..."
CH9_Main_9_2_71,"He fought for everyone..."
CH9_Main_9_2_72,"But thanks to Lua, she transferred our great hero's powers to you before you were even born."
CH9_Main_9_2_73,"Even after finding out that Kyle could no longer fight against Angmund, he didn't give up."
CH9_Main_9_2_74,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_75,"And in the end, he managed to bring down Dark Lord Angmund by sacrificing his life..."
CH9_Main_9_2_76,"He did it all on his own."
CH9_Main_9_2_77,"But that sacrifice of his didn't mean anything to Lua."
CH9_Main_9_2_78,"The 100 years of peace you enjoyed until now... It was nothing more than a false peace."
CH9_Main_9_2_79,"But the people were convinced that peace has arrived for all eternity."
CH9_Main_9_2_80,"Lua was praised, and the Warrior of the Holy Sword was praised as the agent of Lua."
CH9_Main_9_2_81,"Lua?"
CH9_Main_9_2_82,"Lua's blessings!?"
CH9_Main_9_2_83,"Lua's Holy Sword!?"
CH9_Main_9_2_84,"Lua's Warrior!?"
CH9_Main_9_2_85,"No!"
CH9_Main_9_2_86,"That was all Kyle's strength, a mere human!"
CH9_Main_9_2_87,"King Kyle..."
CH9_Main_9_2_88,"He bled out everything he had to desperately bring down Angmund to protect his loved ones!"
CH9_Main_9_2_89,"It was the strength of a single human... It was the strength of Kyle, whom we all loved..."
CH9_Main_9_2_90,"But Lua just threw him out to keep the Holy Sword safe."
CH9_Main_9_2_91,"Lua abandoned Kyle, who threw away everything to bring the peace the goddess wanted..."
CH9_Main_9_2_92,"And even when Angmund gnawed upon his body, Kyle never dropped his sword until the end!"
CH9_Main_9_2_93,"...Maria."
CH9_Main_9_2_94,"Whew... I got a bit too agitated..."
CH9_Main_9_2_95,"When I said I wanted to see something out of you all..."
CH9_Main_9_2_96,"It was the sight of you saving Kyle."
CH9_Main_9_2_97,"I want you to go save him..."
CH9_Main_9_2_98,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_99,"My acts may seem twisted... but everything I did was to save Kyle..."
CH9_Main_9_2_100,"Hah hah... It feels embarrassing to let it all out..."
CH9_Main_9_2_101,"It's been a while since I felt like this."
CH9_Main_9_2_102,"Maybe it's because you're his son... You remind me of him a lot..."
CH9_Main_9_2_103,"Thank you."
CH9_Main_9_2_104,"For what?"
CH9_Main_9_2_105,"It must have been hard for you to tell me about this..."
CH9_Main_9_2_106,"About my father, my mother, and about you..."
CH9_Main_9_2_107,"Just shut it..."
CH9_Main_9_2_108,"I will save him."
CH9_Main_9_2_109,"He's turned into this fearsome, dangerous being..."
CH9_Main_9_2_110,"And I have never called him my father, let alone seen him."
CH9_Main_9_2_111,"But I will do everything I can to save him. I promise."
CH9_Main_9_2_112,"Please take my hand."
CH9_Main_9_2_113,"And lead me on the path."
CH9_Main_9_2_114,"You're such a brat..."
CH9_Main_9_2_115,"Let's go together. Everyone is resting by the fire."
CH9_Main_9_2_116,"Although everyone is keeping quiet, no one hates you or Morrah."
CH9_Main_9_2_117,"You're lying..."
CH9_Main_9_2_118,"No, it's just how they are."
CH9_Main_9_2_119,"They understand suffering. That's why they also understand the pain you're going through."
CH9_Main_9_2_120,"Come on, let's go. To our friends."
CH9_Main_9_2_121,"...But I..."
CH9_Main_9_2_122,"I'm very glad... to have you by my side."
CH9_Main_9_2_123,"What? Are you here to pick a fight again?"
CH9_Main_9_2_124,"You were just worrying about her missing. Be honest, Cleo."
CH9_Main_9_2_125,"Wh-when did I say that!?"
CH9_Main_9_2_126,"By the way, where did Morrah go? She still has to get some rest."
CH9_Main_9_2_127,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_128,"Gosh... What am I supposed to do with you all?"
CH9_Main_9_2_129,"Hah, you did good work for a brat."
CH9_Main_9_2_130,"Hah hah... The Warrior of the Holy Sword... Now I'm sure of it..."
CH9_Main_9_2_131,"You're more than worthy of being called a hero."
CH9_Main_9_2_132,"I don't see the Princess, either. I will go find her."
CH9_Main_9_2_133,"Just sit and stay there. I don't want you to wander and get lost."
CH9_Main_9_2_134,"Understood."
CH9_Main_9_2_135,"You're back."
CH9_Main_9_2_136,"Was Morrah with you?"
CH9_Main_9_2_137,"Ah, I just had something to check with her."
CH9_Main_9_2_138,"Together!?"
CH9_Main_9_2_139,"Yes, right?"
CH9_Main_9_2_140,"Oh, r-right."
CH9_Main_9_2_141,"Well, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Did something good happen?"
CH9_Main_9_2_142,"Ahem! We were talking about this archmage's performance at the Dragia Volcano!"
CH9_Main_9_2_143,"..."
CH9_Main_9_2_144,"The person I've never called my father."
CH9_Main_9_2_145,"But now I know why you insisted on the path you walked."
CH9_Main_9_2_146,"I found out why you never laid down your sword,"
CH9_Main_9_2_147,"even though you knew about your death."
CH9_Main_9_2_148,"I won't hesitate anymore."
CH9_Main_9_2_149,"Just as you raised your sword without hesitation"
CH9_Main_9_2_150,"to protect your loved ones."
CH9_Main_9_2_151,"I, too, will raise my sword for the same goal."
CH9_Main_9_2_152,"I cannot forgive the goddess for what she did."
CH9_Main_9_2_153,"But if that was not the case, you would have not been able to protect anything."
CH9_Main_9_2_154,"Father."
CH9_Main_9_2_155,"I am coming to meet you."
CH9_Main_10_1,"As the dark night skies gave way to the morning,"
CH9_Main_10_2,"and everyone prepared to move out to the old Dark Lord's Castle,"
CH9_Main_10_3,"Maria told everyone about what she had told Kasel"
CH9_Main_10_4,"by the lake on the night before."
CH9_Main_10_5,"Everyone was shocked by the truth... and could not find any words to say."
CH9_Main_10_6,"That's... impossible..."
CH9_Main_10_7,"Lua... abandoned her warrior?"
CH9_Main_10_8,"And the current Dark Lord is..."
CH9_Main_10_9,"King Kyle... the one who saved us from the last Dark Lord?"
CH9_Main_10_10,"I can't believe it, even though it's coming from someone who actually experienced it..."
CH9_Main_10_11,"And... Kasel is King Kyle's... son?"
CH9_Main_10_12,"That means... Kasel... will fight his own father..?"
CH9_Main_10_13,"Unbelievable..."
CH9_Main_10_14,"..."
CH9_Main_10_15,"Frey?"
CH9_Main_10_16,"Ah... I'm sorry... I'm just a bit confused..."
CH9_Main_10_17,"That's understandable."
CH9_Main_10_18,"Why would Lua...?"
CH9_Main_10_19,"And the Dark Lord corrupted King Kyle's mind, right?"
CH9_Main_10_20,"Doesn't that mean the same thing could happen to Kasel?"
CH9_Main_10_21,"Is it really even possible to stop that?"
CH9_Main_10_22,"Isn't it dangerous to just go in recklessly?"
CH9_Main_10_23,"He is unstable at the moment... Even if he was corrupted, he would still be unstable without the completed Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_10_24,"We can't be sure if he would still be at the Dark Lord's Castle, but if he is there..."
CH9_Main_10_25,"I doubt that. The Imperial Army visits the place regularly."
CH9_Main_10_26,"The Imperial Army?"
CH9_Main_10_27,"They are digging up the artifacts of the Ancient Technomagic Kingdom."
CH9_Main_10_28,"But doesn't this territory belong to the kingdom? Are the Imperial Army allowed to be here?"
CH9_Main_10_29,"It's right on the border with the Empire."
CH9_Main_10_30,"And above all... they have been visiting this place ever since we were busy trying to hide this place out of fear."
CH9_Main_10_31,"We jumped into the scene for the dig later on, but we had to face a possible conflict against the Imperial Army."
CH9_Main_10_32,"On top of that, some of the nobles are making backdoor deals with the Empire."
CH9_Main_10_33,"The Empire is just acting out of formality. They probably don't even consider this place as part of our kingdom's territory now..."
CH9_Main_10_34,"That's preposterous! And those treasonous nobles are even worse!"
CH9_Main_10_35,"When I go to the Empire later, I will definitely demand an answer about this!"
CH9_Main_10_36,"Come on, what can you do about a political situation between two nations?"
CH9_Main_10_37,"Then, I'll just tell my grandpa!"
CH9_Main_10_38,"That's even worse. If he steps up to the plate, it won't just be a spark, he will bring down hell upon these lands."
CH9_Main_10_39,"Grandpa?"
CH9_Main_10_40,"Cleo's grandfather is Dominics of the Tower of Sage."
CH9_Main_10_41,"We've been traveling with the granddaughter of such a powerful figure?"
CH9_Main_10_42,"He's not my real grandpa. And I'm way stronger than the old man!"
CH9_Main_10_43,"I suppose if he really does step up... Never mind, I don't even want to think about it."
CH9_Main_10_44,"The artifacts from Technomagic Kingdom are being treated very carefully by the Tower of Sage as well."
CH9_Main_10_45,"A small energy stone crystal is enough to destroy an entire town, or even reduce a city to dust by accident."
CH9_Main_10_46,"But they're just letting the Empire dig those up?"
CH9_Main_10_47,"Do the nobles of Orvelia have no idea how dangerous those are!? Oops!"
CH9_Main_10_48,"*Sigh*"
CH9_Main_10_49,"It's fine. This is also the fault of the throne for not doing its part."
CH9_Main_10_50,"You didn't say anything wrong."
CH9_Main_10_51,"Though, it was a bit rude."
CH9_Main_10_52,"Demia."
CH9_Main_10_53,"My apologies."
CH9_Main_10_54,"Let's get back on topic."
CH9_Main_10_55,"Maria, you were gathering that power of the rift to stop the Dark Lord's corruption?"
CH9_Main_10_56,"Yes. This power, created from the Dimension Rift, is the demonic power of Angmund."
CH9_Main_10_57,"That means it's able to cast away the power of corruption. Morrah and I tested it with our demonic powers."
CH9_Main_10_58,"Even if the demonic power of the Dark Lord is much stronger than ours, it will be hard to pierce through this power."
CH9_Main_10_59,"That is, as long as he doesn't try to self-destruct by sacrificing himself."
CH9_Main_10_60,"Then, we just have to be careful if he tries self-destruction!"
CH9_Main_10_61,"That's only if the final object we're looking for is actually in that place."
CH9_Main_10_62,"Let's just hope the Imperial Army isn't there at the moment."
CH9_Main_10_63,"*Sigh* But we still have a long way to go..."
CH9_Main_10_64,"Whoaaa! What!?"
CH9_Main_10_65,"Red lightning!"
CH9_Main_10_66,"What now!?"
CH9_Main_10_67,"Did that come from the ruins!?"
CH9_Main_10_68,"You don't have to be so impatient. Of course, it could be dangerous, but we just have to prepare ourselves and approach carefully."
CH9_Main_10_69,"Huh? Uh... Right."
CH9_Main_10_70,"He's definitely changed a lot, hasn't he?"
CH9_Main_10_71,"That's what you call growth."
CH9_Main_10_72,"Which is what I always want out of you."
CH9_Main_10_73,"Bleh!"
CH9_Main_11_1,"The completed Holy Sword. Isn't that thing overpowered?"
CH9_Main_11_2,"I can't believe King Kyle lost with that sword."
CH9_Main_11_3,"He didn't lose. He was corrupted."
CH9_Main_11_4,"And towards the end, he lost the power of the Holy Sword and fought as a normal human."
CH9_Main_11_5,"But still.. that power seems unfair! "
CH9_Main_11_6,"It's only possible for Kasel to use it now."
CH9_Main_11_7,"Did you forget about what Frey said? As Kasel grows, the Holy Sword grows as well."
CH9_Main_12_1,"Wait... This incredible demonic power..."
CH9_Main_12_2,"It doesn't belong to Kyle... It feels different from that... It's too cold..."
CH9_Main_12_3,"It just feels like an abyssal wall... but what is this enormous size?"
CH9_Main_12_4,"Wh-what's this? It's making my entire body shudder."
CH9_Main_12_5,"Is this related to that red lightning from earlier?"
CH9_Main_12_6,"Let's hope not."
CH9_Main_12_7,"That lightning was powerful enough to blow away an entire tower."
CH9_Main_12_8,"If we run into such demonic power, we might go insane."
CH9_Main_12_9,"But we have the Holy Sword!"
CH9_Main_12_10,"Yeah! If things go wrong, Kasel can destroy the tower!"
CH9_Main_12_11,"..."
CH9_Main_12_12,"..."
CH9_Main_12_13,"Alright, should I try?"
CH9_Main_12_14,"Please don't encourage her."
CH9_Main_12_15,"Hah hah..."
CH9_Main_14_1,"Once we get past this place, we'll arrive at the entrance to the ruins."
CH9_Main_14_2,"Looks like the Imperial Army is here as expected."
CH9_Main_14_3,"..."
CH9_Main_14_4,"Kasel."
CH9_Main_14_5,"Yes, Your Highness?"
CH9_Main_14_6,"Once we go inside the ruins, like it or not, we will run into the Imperial Army."
CH9_Main_14_7,"Before we go inside, I want to try dueling you if it's not too much trouble."
CH9_Main_14_8,"If you're not ready because of the sudden request, we can put it off to a later date."
CH9_Main_14_9,"..."
CH9_Main_14_10,"I think it will be fine."
CH9_Main_14_11,"Clause."
CH9_Main_14_12,"Yes, Your Highness."
CH9_Main_14_13,"Clause, I entrust you to be the witness."
CH9_Main_14_14,"Yes, Your Highness."
CH9_Main_14_15,"Kasel, the Princess is strong. Very strong, actually."
CH9_Main_14_16,"Thank you for your concern. I will try my best not to lose."
CH9_Main_14_17,"..."
CH9_Main_14_18,"..."
CH9_Main_14_19,"Hah, you goof."
CH9_Main_14_20,"If the duel becomes too heated, I will intervene."
CH9_Main_14_21,"Yes, of course."
CH9_Main_14_22,"Please go easy on me."
CH9_Main_14_1_1,"Whew..."
CH9_Main_14_1_2,"..."
CH9_Main_14_1_3,"You are strong."
CH9_Main_14_1_4,"Thank you."
CH9_Main_14_1_5,"You managed to match my blade, even without using the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_14_1_6,"How much of your skill did you use in this duel?"
CH9_Main_14_1_7,"To be honest, it wasn't very hard for me."
CH9_Main_14_1_8,"Is that so?"
CH9_Main_14_1_9,"I understand."
CH9_Main_14_1_10,"Is that a hawk screeching?"
CH9_Main_14_1_11,"What's that?"
CH9_Main_14_1_12,"It's a hawk from Orvelia."
CH9_Main_14_1_13,"Princess!"
CH9_Main_14_1_14,"If it was sent in such a rush, this news must be important."
CH9_Main_14_1_15,"My father... has fallen."
CH9_Main_14_1_16,"The King!?"
CH9_Main_14_1_17,"And at the same time, the Chancellor disappeared from the capital."
CH9_Main_14_1_18,"That treacherous traitor finally revealed himself!"
CH9_Main_14_1_19,"We cannot delay even a moment. We will return to Orvel right away."
CH9_Main_14_1_20,"Even if we use the portal, Aegina Desert will be the farthest location we will be able to reach."
CH9_Main_14_1_21,"Then, we will have to procure some scrolls from there."
CH9_Main_14_1_22,"Scrolls... in the middle of a desert?"
CH9_Main_14_1_23,"Your Highness... I have bad news."
CH9_Main_14_1_24,"??"
CH9_Main_14_1_25,"The portal scrolls are not working."
CH9_Main_14_1_26,"What? The greatest wizards from the capital gathered their mana to create these special long-distance scrolls."
CH9_Main_14_1_27,"It seems like the demonic energy of this swamp is interfering..."
CH9_Main_14_1_28,"That means it will be impossible to get out of here by using ordinary scrolls."
CH9_Main_14_1_29,"Then, we'll have to get out of this swamp as soon as possible."
CH9_Main_14_1_30,"Wait, hold on a second."
CH9_Main_14_1_31,"??"
CH9_Main_14_1_32,"Let me handle this!"
CH9_Main_14_1_33,"First, this is yours, Mr. Doggy."
CH9_Main_14_1_34,"My name Chase. Not Doggy."
CH9_Main_14_1_35,"It's a nickname! And this is really rare!"
CH9_Main_14_1_36,"Portal scroll? But didn't you just hear?"
CH9_Main_14_1_37,"Portals don't work in this place."
CH9_Main_14_1_38,"It works."
CH9_Main_14_1_39,"...Ahem!"
CH9_Main_14_1_40,"Who do you think I am?"
CH9_Main_14_1_41,"I'm already known as a prodigy in the Tower of Sage."
CH9_Main_14_1_42,"I suppose that does make sense, coming from the granddaughter of Dominics."
CH9_Main_14_1_43,"No! It's not from my grandpa! This is all my doing!"
CH9_Main_14_1_44,"She fell for that easily."
CH9_Main_14_1_45,"I agree. Hah hah, it is certainly fun teasing her."
CH9_Main_14_1_46,"..."
CH9_Main_14_1_47,"...I'll make sure to prepare a fire needle later."
CH9_Main_14_1_48,"Don't. If you do something like that to the Princess, you'll be executed for sure."
CH9_Main_14_1_49,"Whatever. Just give me the scrolls that aren't working."
CH9_Main_14_1_50,"There, now it's going to work."
CH9_Main_14_1_51,"Incredible..."
CH9_Main_14_1_52,"Everyone knows about the scroll restrictions, right?"
CH9_Main_14_1_53,"No more than two persons."
CH9_Main_14_1_54,"It has an absurd crafting cost that an ordinary person could never even think of."
CH9_Main_14_1_55,"The coordinate accuracy and travel distance based on the mana. Are you talking about them?"
CH9_Main_14_1_56,"And there is also a memorization restriction that prevents mass production."
CH9_Main_14_1_57,"That portal scroll is filled to the top with my mana. It's the longest scroll you'll ever see!"
CH9_Main_14_1_58,"But it can only send one person at a time."
CH9_Main_14_1_59,"I only gave Mr. Doggy a separate one because he joined us later."
CH9_Main_14_1_60,"You cared for me..."
CH9_Main_14_1_61,"I... thank you."
CH9_Main_14_1_62,"And since I've never been to Orvel,"
CH9_Main_14_1_63,"you'll probably fall inside the forest in front of the city."
CH9_Main_14_1_64,"Although, the forest should be right in front of the city..."
CH9_Main_14_1_65,"That's more than enough!"
CH9_Main_14_1_66,"Orvelia... requires your aid."
CH9_Main_14_1_67,"Demia, you are too outspoken."
CH9_Main_14_1_68,"Hah hah! Now you finally see the real value of this great wizard!"
CH9_Main_14_1_69,"For your information, I can open a portal without a scroll!"
CH9_Main_14_1_70,"That's enough boasting."
CH9_Main_14_1_71,"Awww, you ruined my moment."
CH9_Main_14_1_72,"Clause, you may stay behind."
CH9_Main_14_1_73,"No, I will go back to the capital as well."
CH9_Main_14_1_74,"Is that okay with you, Kasel?"
CH9_Main_14_1_75,"Of course. When we meet again, I'll become a brother you'll be even more proud of."
CH9_Main_14_1_76,"The Princess seems to have found an answer from her heart after meeting you."
CH9_Main_14_1_77,"So, once the situation at the capital is resolved, I will come find you on my own if needed."
CH9_Main_14_1_78,"I'll be waiting."
CH9_Main_14_1_79,"Yes, keep Frey safe."
CH9_Main_14_1_80,"Clause."
CH9_Main_14_1_81,"I can relax, knowing that you'll be by his side."
CH9_Main_14_1_82,"Hah hah..."
CH9_Main_14_1_83,"Please take care of him."
CH9_Main_14_1_84,"Keep safe until we meet again."
CH9_Main_14_1_85,"Lua's blessings..."
CH9_Main_14_1_86,"..."
CH9_Main_14_1_87,"Please be safe."
CH9_Main_14_1_88,"Well, Kasel."
CH9_Main_14_1_89,"I look forward to sharing more stories with you when we meet again."
CH9_Main_14_1_90,"Yes, Your Highness. I will return to the kingdom with pride."
CH9_Main_14_1_91,"Yes, we are counting on you, Warrior of the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_14_1_92,"No, you're the warrior carrying all our hopes."
CH9_Main_14_1_93,"(The Princess has acknowledged you, Kasel...)"
CH9_Main_14_1_94,"Clause happy. But Princess sad."
CH9_Main_14_1_95,"Shh. It's not like that."
CH9_Main_15_1,"Wh-what's this?"
CH9_Main_15_2,"This is literal chaos."
CH9_Main_15_3,"Did a war break out here or something?"
CH9_Main_15_4,"It might have something to do with that powerful demonic energy we felt earlier."
CH9_Main_15_5,"Let's assess the situation first."
CH9_Main_15_6,"We should move separately for now."
CH9_Main_15_7,"Morrah and I will focus on the remains of the ruins."
CH9_Main_15_8,"For what?"
CH9_Main_15_9,"It's definitely here. The object Maria is looking for."
CH9_Main_15_10,"You mean the thing that's needed for completing the Dimension Rift?"
CH9_Main_15_11,"Yes. We've already looked around all of the other places within the kingdom."
CH9_Main_15_12,"We thoroughly searched all of the ruins within the kingdom, except Eastern Empire and the Empire that were out of Dark Lord Angmund's reach."
CH9_Main_15_13,"And now, this is the final place."
CH9_Main_15_14,"We'll meet up again at the old Dark Lord's Castle over there."
CH9_Main_15_15,"Are you sure the two of you will be okay?"
CH9_Main_15_16,"Hmph, you kids better watch out. You guys attract too much attention."
CH9_Main_15_17,"...Wh-what?"
CH9_Main_15_18,"Let's move."
CH9_Main_15_19,"Don't die on me now."
CH9_Main_15_20,"Morrah... also changed."
CH9_Main_15_21,"The Holy Dragon is probably making up a lot of her personality... Although she talks a bit scary..."
CH9_Main_15_22,"Well, now that the real magnets for trouble are gone, we'll be safe."
CH9_Main_15_23,"We should split up into two groups as well."
CH9_Main_15_24,"Yes, that should be safer. Although we can't compare to those two,"
CH9_Main_15_25,"we can't deny that we also attract quite a lot of attention as well."
CH9_Main_15_26,"Frey and I will go together to check out this area."
CH9_Main_15_27,"There might be some people who may need our help."
CH9_Main_15_28,"Then, we'll go check out the outskirts."
CH9_Main_15_29,"I can't get that energy from before out of my mind."
CH9_Main_15_30,"And there's also one more thing that's bothering me."
CH9_Main_15_31,"Hmm?"
CH9_Main_15_32,"Never mind."
CH9_Main_15_33,"We will go on ahead. Let's meet up later."
CH9_Main_15_34,"Yes. Please be careful, Roi, Cleo."
CH9_Main_15_35,"Shall we go, Frey?"
CH9_Main_17_1_1,"Intruders! Demons!?"
CH9_Main_17_1_2,"No, we are not demons."
CH9_Main_17_1_3,"Regardless, we were given orders to kill any outsiders on sight."
CH9_Main_17_1_4,"Looks like we have no choice."
CH9_Main_17_2_1,"Those soldiers..."
CH9_Main_17_2_2,"They're just knocked out. They will probably stay unconscious for the rest of the day."
CH9_Main_17_2_3,"That's a relief..."
CH9_Main_17_2_4,"Let's... keep this up..."
CH9_Main_17_2_5,"Frey!"
CH9_Main_17_2_6,"Ha! You dodged?"
CH9_Main_17_2_7,"You guys look like fun!"
CH9_Main_17_3_1,"Whoa! Whoa! You're good!"
CH9_Main_17_3_2,"Kya hah hah! It's time to burn!"
CH9_Main_17_4_1,"You're annoying! Just die!"
CH9_Main_17_5_1,"*Huff* *Huff* You're... a monster."
CH9_Main_17_5_2,"You're very strong as well... But it's time to end this."
CH9_Main_17_5_3,"Hah hah, you're so full of yourself."
CH9_Main_17_5_4,"!?"
CH9_Main_17_5_5,"Kya hah hah! I was wondering where you were. But I see that you were getting beat up here!"
CH9_Main_17_5_6,"Huh!? You..."
CH9_Main_17_5_7,"You mongrel!"
CH9_Main_17_5_8,"I hate you! Hate you! Hate you!"
CH9_Main_17_5_9,"Whoa!"
CH9_Main_17_5_10,"Hey! We're on the same side!"
CH9_Main_17_5_11,"And I'll shoot you if you call me a mongrel again!"
CH9_Main_17_5_12,"Bleh!"
CH9_Main_17_5_13,"By the way, you fight really well!"
CH9_Main_17_5_14,"..."
CH9_Main_17_5_15,"But it's about time you die now!"
CH9_Main_18_1_1,"Whoa, this guy is crazy!"
CH9_Main_18_1_2,"Try blocking this!"
CH9_Main_18_1_3,"This, and this!"
CH9_Main_18_1_4,"Ack!? You blocked them all!?"
CH9_Main_18_1_5,"What is that sword!?"
CH9_Main_18_1_6,"Kya hah! Move! You're in the way!"
CH9_Main_18_1_7,"Why, you!"
CH9_Main_18_1_8,"Burn!"
CH9_Main_18_1_9,"Are you trying to kill us all!?"
CH9_Main_18_2_1,"Haa!"
CH9_Main_18_2_2,"Wow! You're quite the opponent!"
CH9_Main_18_2_3,"Ah! If only that mongrel didn't interfere!"
CH9_Main_18_2_4,"Kya hah hah! You shot me!?"
CH9_Main_18_2_5,"I told you that I was going to shoot you if you call me a mongrel again!"
CH9_Main_18_2_6,"You really are a mad mongrel, kya hah hah!"
CH9_Main_18_2_7,"What? You're dead meat! Eat lead!"
CH9_Main_18_2_8,"Ah hah hah! I guess I'm going to have to burn this mongrel, too!"
CH9_Main_18_2_9,"You're dead!"
CH9_Main_18_2_10,"What the...?"
CH9_Main_18_3_1,"An opening!"
CH9_Main_18_3_2,"Kya!"
CH9_Main_18_3_3,"Tsk, damn!"
CH9_Main_18_3_4,"!?"
CH9_Main_18_3_5,"Whaa!"
CH9_Main_18_3_6,"Ahhh!"
CH9_Main_18_3_7,"*Sigh* What are you two doing?"
CH9_Main_18_3_8,"Old man!"
CH9_Main_18_3_9,"Huh? I thought you were dead!"
CH9_Main_18_3_10,"..."
CH9_Main_18_3_11,"(...This man is dangerous.)"
CH9_Main_18_3_12,"Frey, just hold back a little."
CH9_Main_18_3_13,"In the name of the goddess!"
CH9_Main_18_3_14,"Ahh, you let them go!"
CH9_Main_18_3_15,"Well, that's probably because you shot at me, mongrel!"
CH9_Main_18_3_16,"Don't start that again!"
CH9_Main_18_3_17,"..."
CH9_Main_18_3_18,"He has something to say to us."
CH9_Main_18_3_19,"...Return."
CH9_Main_18_3_20,"Ex-Hound Unit, Second Lieutenant Pansirone! Orders to return to the unit!"
CH9_Main_18_3_21,"Yes, let's move."
CH9_Main_18_3_22,"Aren't we going to chase them? They've gotten on my nerves."
CH9_Main_18_3_23,"Yeah, yeah! Now that he's here, let's go and burn them all!"
CH9_Main_18_3_24,"..."
CH9_Main_18_3_25,"...Then, again, we should prioritize regrouping with the unit first!"
CH9_Main_18_3_26,"Right! It's too bad we have to release them now, but we can find them later!"
CH9_Main_18_3_27,"You probably saw, old man, but I fought really hard."
CH9_Main_18_3_28,"Aww, if only this mongrel didn't shoot at me..."
CH9_Main_18_3_29,"Damn you! You called me a mongrel again!"
CH9_Main_18_3_30,"Kya hah hah!"
CH9_Main_18_3_31,"*Sigh*"
CH9_Main_19_1,"Were they the Imperial Army?"
CH9_Main_19_2,"They have incredible powers..."
CH9_Main_19_3,"And if we run into that man who showed up at the end again... will we be able to get away?"
CH9_Main_19_4,"It seemed like he let us go on purpose..."
CH9_Main_19_5,"No... This isn't the time to think about that..."
CH9_Main_19_6,"Ugh..."
CH9_Main_19_7,"Frey, are you alright?"
CH9_Main_19_8,"Kasel..."
CH9_Main_19_9,"Why did I...?"
CH9_Main_19_10,"That's what I wanted to ask."
CH9_Main_19_11,"You went unconscious all of a sudden."
CH9_Main_19_12,"Why all of a sudden?"
CH9_Main_19_13,"Kasel..."
CH9_Main_19_14,"I feel strange these days."
CH9_Main_19_15,"Maybe it's because your body is tired."
CH9_Main_19_16,"No, I feel like there's some sort of a strange power within me."
CH9_Main_19_17,"..."
CH9_Main_19_18,"A strange power?"
CH9_Main_19_19,"What do you mean by that?"
CH9_Main_19_20,"A power that my body is denying..."
CH9_Main_19_21,"I've had this for a very long time."
CH9_Main_19_22,"How long ago are we talking about?"
CH9_Main_19_23,"The power that I've had even before I went into the orphanage..."
CH9_Main_19_24,"The power that Great Priestess Iris sealed up for me."
CH9_Main_19_25,"How did you...?"
CH9_Main_19_26,"Grandfather told me about it."
CH9_Main_19_27,"It wasn't long after I became an apprentice. I realized something was wrong with my body and went to talk with the Great Priestess."
CH9_Main_19_28,"I heard my grandfather talking with the Great Priestess. That's when he told me."
CH9_Main_19_29,"What did your grandfather say?"
CH9_Main_19_30,"I don't know the details. My grandfather didn't know much, either."
CH9_Main_19_31,"He just told me to be careful."
CH9_Main_19_32,"And that nothing will happen if I continue to train my holy powers."
CH9_Main_19_33,"Actually, I've forgotten about this power ever since the Great Priestess sealed it up."
CH9_Main_19_34,"It's only recently that I've felt it again."
CH9_Main_19_35,"While we've been traveling together, I've felt some sort of an echo that spread throughout my body multiple times."
CH9_Main_19_36,"What could this be..?"
CH9_Main_19_37,"..."
CH9_Main_19_38,"I've never lost consciousness like this before, though."
CH9_Main_19_39,"I think it's gotten worse after we ran into King Kyle."
CH9_Main_19_40,"..."
CH9_Main_19_41,"When I heard about how I came back to life back at Snow Mountain,"
CH9_Main_19_42,"I believed that this strange power inside me saved my life. And I was relieved to know that this power was a blessing."
CH9_Main_19_43,"But I don't think that's completely right... There was something else, something small..."
CH9_Main_19_44,"It feels as if, deep inside, the essence of this energy is so heavy that it's crushing me..."
CH9_Main_19_45,"Frey..."
CH9_Main_19_46,"We should go back to the Great Priestess right now."
CH9_Main_19_47,"No, not right now."
CH9_Main_19_48,"Don't be ridiculous. The fact that you passed out like that..."
CH9_Main_19_49,"And from what you said, this strange power of yours started getting stronger after meeting King Kyle."
CH9_Main_19_50,"It just can't be good for you."
CH9_Main_19_51,"Listen to me, Kasel. This is very important to me."
CH9_Main_19_52,"Since I've followed Lua until now, it's very difficult for me to accept what she has done."
CH9_Main_19_53,"And I'm trying to convince myself that she's done it for a reason."
CH9_Main_19_54,"Even though it doesn't make sense to anyone..."
CH9_Main_19_55,"That's why I want to lead you to the path of light, regardless of my faith."
CH9_Main_19_56,"Frey..."
CH9_Main_19_57,"That way... I'll be able to know... if... I am on the right path..."
CH9_Main_19_58,"As Lua's servant... as her priestess who will continue to spread her teachings..."
CH9_Main_19_59,"I'll have to decide how to interpret her deeds..."
CH9_Main_19_60,"..."
CH9_Main_19_61,"So, let's go."
CH9_Main_19_62,"Frey..."
CH9_Main_19_63,"..."
CH9_Main_19_64,"*Sigh* Fine."
CH9_Main_19_65,"But if you're not feeling well, tell me right away."
CH9_Main_19_66,"Thank you, Kasel."
CH9_Main_19_67,"Let's regroup with the others first."
CH9_Main_20_1,"You're all here already."
CH9_Main_20_2,"You're late. We were starting to get worried."
CH9_Main_20_3,"Hah hah, we ran into some scary people."
CH9_Main_20_4,"Scary people?"
CH9_Main_20_5,"They seemed like Imperial soldiers... but they were incredibly powerful."
CH9_Main_20_6,"Hmph, you seem pretty relaxed while saying that."
CH9_Main_20_7,"No... If we ever run into that man who showed up at the end again..."
CH9_Main_20_8,"What if we meet him?"
CH9_Main_20_9,"I'm not sure if we'll be able to get away from him."
CH9_Main_20_10,"What do you mean? Why do you have doubts?"
CH9_Main_20_11,"It seemed as if he let us go on purpose."
CH9_Main_20_12,"That's strange..."
CH9_Main_20_13,"Well, I also ran into some annoying people as well."
CH9_Main_20_14,"Roi..."
CH9_Main_20_15,"It's fine."
CH9_Main_20_16,"If I run into him again, I'll have a lot to say as well."
CH9_Main_20_17,"It won't be like last time."
CH9_Main_20_18,"That would be nice."
CH9_Main_20_19,"That's why once we're done with this place, Roi and I are going to visit the Tower of Sage."
CH9_Main_20_20,"The Tower of Sage?"
CH9_Main_20_21,"Yeah. I call myself an archmage, but I'm still a baby compared to Grandpa."
CH9_Main_20_22,"I understand my skill level. And it's been a while since I've seen the old man's face..."
CH9_Main_20_23,"I can't make any scrolls right now, so we can't all go together. But I'll bring back a bunch from the tower. We can all go meet Grandpa."
CH9_Main_20_24,"Yes, I'm sure Great Sage Dominics will be able to answer a lot of our questions."
CH9_Main_20_25,"We prioritized checking out the buildings that were intact."
CH9_Main_20_26,"And we're sure of it now."
CH9_Main_20_27,"Sure of what?"
CH9_Main_20_28,"I don't know how long it's been, but these ruins are currently being powered again."
CH9_Main_20_29,"And that's why the Imperial Army rushed to the site."
CH9_Main_20_30,"And I've noticed a lot of Malduk's traces all over the place."
CH9_Main_20_31,"There were also traces of his necromancy here."
CH9_Main_20_32,"Malduk!?"
CH9_Main_20_33,"It seems like the mess we saw when we arrived"
CH9_Main_20_34,"was caused by a fight between Malduk and the Imperial Army."
CH9_Main_20_35,"He's really keeping busy, isn't he?"
CH9_Main_20_36,"Doesn't the Dark Legion have anyone else other than him?"
CH9_Main_20_37,"...Hah hah."
CH9_Main_20_38,"Hah hah! That makes sense."
CH9_Main_20_39,"But it means he is very loyal to the Dark Legion..."
CH9_Main_20_40,"The members of the Dark Legion don't have strong ties like humans."
CH9_Main_20_41,"The ones who were acting as officers that destroyed the kingdom slowly hid away after the defeat of Angmund."
CH9_Main_20_42,"Malduk was once human, yet he has become more demonic than the actual demons... Strange..."
CH9_Main_20_43,"Anyway! I'll make sure to beat up that pile of bones!"
CH9_Main_20_44,"Do you see that large pillar over there?"
CH9_Main_20_45,"You mean that large tower?"
CH9_Main_20_46,"I heard Malduk talking about it. That tower collects massive mana,"
CH9_Main_20_47,"and it acts as a transmitter for large groups of people or objects."
CH9_Main_20_48,"And if a place like that is staying active, it must mean that there is a clue about Kyle there."
CH9_Main_20_49,"Though, we have no idea what it might be."
CH9_Main_20_50,"Malduk and the reactivated power... along with the transmission tower..."
CH9_Main_20_51,"Then, we'll definitely have to check it out."
CH9_Main_20_52,"Yes, but you'd better be prepared."
CH9_Main_20_53,"Something keeps bothering me."
CH9_Main_20_54,"Huh? What are you talking about?"
CH9_Main_20_55,"This enormous and twisted demonic energy..."
CH9_Main_21_1,"Frey, you don't look so good."
CH9_Main_21_2,"I must be a bit tired."
CH9_Main_21_3,"Hang in there, Frey! We're almost there."
CH9_Main_21_4,"Wait, over there... It's a giant..."
CH9_Main_21_5,"Mechanical doll?"
CH9_Main_21_6,"Damn! There's still something like that left here!?"
CH9_Main_21_1_1,"We found it."
CH9_Main_21_1_2,"??"
CH9_Main_21_1_3,"This is it. The energy source of the Ancient Technmagic Kingdom."
CH9_Main_21_1_4,"And this energy is refined elaborately enough to stabilize the rift's power."
CH9_Main_21_1_5,"If we have this..."
CH9_Main_21_1_6,"Kasel."
CH9_Main_21_1_7,"Yes?"
CH9_Main_21_1_8,"Come here."
CH9_Main_21_1_9,"What's this?"
CH9_Main_21_1_10,"You're now coated with the dimensional power of the rift through the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_21_1_11,"With this power, you will be able to partially resist the corrupting powers of Angmund that took down Kyle."
CH9_Main_21_1_12,"Maria..."
CH9_Main_21_1_13,"*Sigh* It's been a long journey."
CH9_Main_21_1_14,"Thank you, Maria."
CH9_Main_21_1_15,"No, it's all thanks to you."
CH9_Main_21_1_16,"(I guess she's not going to talk about that, huh?)"
CH9_Main_21_1_17,"(Hasn't she become less abrasive lately?)"
CH9_Main_21_1_18,"And it's not over yet."
CH9_Main_21_1_19,"No! That's not it!"
CH9_Main_21_1_20,"??"
CH9_Main_21_1_21,"I mean, it's not over yet!"
CH9_Main_21_1_22,"Now that you have this power, you have to go to that tower."
CH9_Main_21_1_23,"Of course."
CH9_Main_21_1_24,"Let's go. Regardless of what awaits us there..."
CH9_Main_21_1_25,"I'm hoping that skull guy is waiting for us. I'm going to beat him up good."
CH9_Main_21_1_26,"I'm thinking the same thing."
CH9_Main_24_1,"Frey, what are you doing here?"
CH9_Main_24_2,"Ah, Kasel..."
CH9_Main_24_3,"This sky makes me think about a lot of things..."
CH9_Main_24_4,"Yeah..."
CH9_Main_24_5,"My father..."
CH9_Main_24_6,"He was the King and also the hero who protected this land."
CH9_Main_24_7,"I'm going to have to face him soon... It's a lot to handle."
CH9_Main_24_8,"It just feels surreal."
CH9_Main_24_9,"Keep talking..."
CH9_Main_24_10,"It all feels like someone else's story."
CH9_Main_24_11,"So far, I've been getting dragged around in my travels."
CH9_Main_24_12,"But I've learned a lot from recent events."
CH9_Main_24_13,"The precious smiles I've seen countless times from the people I love."
CH9_Main_24_14,"I understood after seeing them with my own eyes."
CH9_Main_24_15,"After getting rid of all anxiety, fear, and hesitation that held back my will to protect them, I finally realized it."
CH9_Main_24_16,"I believe King Kyle felt the same way."
CH9_Main_24_17,"I'm sure that's why he tried to protect everyone through corruption without giving up."
CH9_Main_24_18,"That's why I want to save him now."
CH9_Main_24_19,"That way, he can be who he really is: the Hero Kyle who wanted to protect everyone."
CH9_Main_24_20,"..."
CH9_Main_24_21,"..."
CH9_Main_24_22,"Is that too simple?"
CH9_Main_24_23,"No, I think that's more than enough."
CH9_Main_24_24,"..."
CH9_Main_24_25,"..."
CH9_Main_24_26,"Hey..."
CH9_Main_24_27,"Once everything is over. Let's go meet them."
CH9_Main_24_28,"Everyone who has helped us out throughout this journey."
CH9_Main_24_29,"Kasel..."
CH9_Main_24_30,"I want you to be by my side when we do that."
CH9_Main_24_31,"I will always be by your side as well."
CH9_Main_24_32,"(I will always... always protect you by your side...)"
CH9_Main_27_1,"Jane! Wait up!"
CH9_Main_27_2,"How are you moving so fast while holding that huge thing?"
CH9_Main_27_3,"Whew, my wings are all stiff."
CH9_Main_27_4,"That light..."
CH9_Main_27_5,"Huh? This place is up and running again?"
CH9_Main_27_6,"...I remember."
CH9_Main_27_7,"The desecrated... place..."
CH9_Main_27_8,"The place that can't be reached anymore..."
CH9_Main_27_9,"Ah... Ah... Ahhh..."
CH9_Main_27_10,"This mark... Is it Mr. Handsome's?"
CH9_Main_27_11,"Huh!? Jane! Mr. Handsome must be here!"
CH9_Main_27_12,"Mr. Handsome?"
CH9_Main_27_13,"Yeah, that handsome guy we wanted to meet again!"
CH9_Main_27_14,"Ooh! I'm feeling pumped all of a sudden! Hey, I'll race you over there... huh?"
CH9_Main_27_15,"Hey, young lady!"
CH9_Main_29_1,"This place is protected by a powerful barrier."
CH9_Main_29_2,"We're finally here, but we can't go inside?"
CH9_Main_29_3,"Cleo, is there no other way?"
CH9_Main_29_4,"Hold on, let me concentrate."
CH9_Main_29_5,"Wait, I feel demonic energy from behind this."
CH9_Main_29_6,"And it's pretty strong... No, incredibly strong!"
CH9_Main_29_7,"Watch out, everyone!"
CH9_Main_29_8,"Huh?"
CH9_Main_29_9,"Wha!?"
CH9_Main_29_10,"Epis!?"
CH9_Main_29_11,"Jane!?"
CH9_Main_29_12,"Ah hah hah, it's the Warrior of the Holy Sword and his ragtag group."
CH9_Main_29_13,"It's a surprise to meet you all here. How have you been?"
CH9_Main_29_14,"That's what we wanted to say. Hah hah... What brings you here?"
CH9_Main_29_15,"!?"
CH9_Main_29_16,"Huh? The Holy Sword recovered its power!"
CH9_Main_29_17,"Ah! I knew being with this group would have been more fun!"
CH9_Main_29_18,"Maria?"
CH9_Main_29_19,"It's been a while. Has your personality improved since then?"
CH9_Main_29_20,"...Buzz off."
CH9_Main_29_21,"Hello, Epis."
CH9_Main_29_22,"Morrah, I see that you're still sticking next to Maria."
CH9_Main_29_23,"Maria is my reason for existence."
CH9_Main_29_24,"Hah hah, you're really cute, Morrah. A real natural when it comes to saying stuff like that."
CH9_Main_29_25,"...Did I hear that wrong?"
CH9_Main_29_26,"...I'll keep quiet."
CH9_Main_29_27,"Hold on, hm..."
CH9_Main_29_28,"...?"
CH9_Main_29_29,"You changed a lot."
CH9_Main_29_30,"Huh?"
CH9_Main_29_31,"Your face looks much nicer."
CH9_Main_29_32,"Hah, hah hah..."
CH9_Main_29_33,"Alright, as a warm-up before entering Mr. Handsome's dream..."
CH9_Main_29_34,"I choose you!"
CH9_Main_29_35,"Epis!"
CH9_Main_29_36,"Ah hah hah, I'm only kidding!"
CH9_Main_29_37,"But, it's true that you look great now."
CH9_Main_29_38,"Thank you."
CH9_Main_29_39,"Now that everyone's gathered here, I guess something really fun is about to go down!"
CH9_Main_29_40,"But that troublemaker is being oddly quiet."
CH9_Main_29_41,"Hello-"
CH9_Main_29_42,"There!"
CH9_Main_29_43,"I removed the barrier!"
CH9_Main_29_44,"Barrier? You guys just removed this tower's barrier? Impressive, that must have been hard!"
CH9_Main_29_45,"Ahem! No barrier can withstand the efforts of this archmage!"
CH9_Main_29_46,"..."
CH9_Main_29_47,"..."
CH9_Main_29_48,"It's coming... Ahh... It hurts... My heart..."
CH9_Main_29_49,"Are you listening to me?"
CH9_Main_29_50,"Wh-what is this!?"
CH9_Main_29_51,"This energy... Is it the same kind from before?"
CH9_Main_29_52,"...I can't breathe..."
CH9_Main_29_53,"Maria!"
CH9_Main_29_54,"Morrah, guard them."
CH9_Main_29_55,"But..."
CH9_Main_29_56,"Hurry!"
CH9_Main_29_57,"The Holy Sword is shaking... It's different from before..."
CH9_Main_29_58,"What's going on?"
CH9_Main_29_59,"I thought... he disappeared. Why all of a sudden?"
CH9_Main_29_60,"Why is he coming out here?"
CH9_Main_29_61,"Everyone... run..."
CH9_Main_29_62,"Epis, do you know this energy?"
CH9_Main_29_63,"You can't beat this one... Just run..."
CH9_Main_29_64,"What?"
CH9_Main_29_65,"Hurry!"
CH9_Main_29_66,"..."
CH9_Main_29_67,"Someone ripped through space?"
CH9_Main_29_68,"Lucikiel..."
CH9_Main_29_69,"Jane, behind me!"
CH9_Main_29_70,"Jane?"
CH9_Main_29_71,"I'm afraid..."
CH9_Main_29_72,"But... I'm not going to step back..."
CH9_Main_29_73,"..."
CH9_Main_29_74,"...You really have bad taste."
CH9_Main_29_75,"Hah hah... What do you think of my masterpiece?"
CH9_Main_29_76,"!!"
CH9_Main_29_77,"Welcome, my daughter."
CH9_Main_29_78,"Malduk!?"
CH9_Main_29_79,"What's going on right now!?"
CH9_Main_29_80,"You managed to get inside... and..."
CH9_Main_29_81,"You completed the Holy Sword."
CH9_Main_29_82,"Good... Now I will take that Holy Sword and perfect him."
CH9_Main_29_83,"Tsk."
CH9_Main_29_84,"This is very bad..."
CH9_Main_29_85,"Malduk isn't the problem right now."
CH9_Main_29_86,"Hah hah, I can finally get rid of all these pests. I may as well handle this traitor while I'm at it. Heh."
CH9_Main_29_87,"..."
CH9_Main_29_88,"Come, Lucikiel. Let us kill the Warrior of the Holy Sword and take the sword to the Dark Lord."
CH9_Main_29_89,"And since that survivor from the Republic of Gray is after me, take care of him as well."
CH9_Main_29_90,"..."
CH9_Main_29_91,"...?"
CH9_Main_29_92,"Why should I listen to you?"
CH9_Main_29_93,"Wh-what?"
CH9_Main_29_94,"If they're pests or trash, you take care of it. That's your problem."
CH9_Main_29_95,"Y-you!"
CH9_Main_29_96,"Fine! I will defeat you all with my true power!"
CH9_Main_29_97,"Keep your eyes open, Lucikiel! And witness my power!"
CH9_Main_30_1,"(He's here!)"
CH9_Main_30_2,"Hurry, hurry! Kill the one that's calling down the lightning, Lucikiel!"
CH9_Main_30_3,"..."
CH9_Main_30_1_1,"Why... you!"
CH9_Main_30_1_2,"Haaa!"
CH9_Main_30_1_3,"Warrior of the Holy Sword!"
CH9_Main_30_1_4,"(What? Why is the power of darkness not working against him?)"
CH9_Main_30_1_5,"(It's not just the Holy Sword's power...)"
CH9_Main_30_1_6,"(If he faces the Dark Lord with such power, it will be dangerous...)"
CH9_Main_30_1_7,"He's really not bothering to fight us?"
CH9_Main_30_1_8,"Don't let your guard down. You never know what might happen."
CH9_Main_30_1_9,"Right!?"
CH9_Main_30_1_10,"Lucikiel, hurry! Stop that! You're supposed to be an officer of the Dark Legion!"
CH9_Main_30_1_11,"I've already fulfilled my contract by eliminating your country."
CH9_Main_30_1_12,"I'm free to do as I will now."
CH9_Main_30_2_1,"!!"
CH9_Main_30_2_2,"I-it can't end like this!"
CH9_Main_30_2_3,"For the Dark Lord..."
CH9_Main_30_2_4,"I'll take you with me, Warrior of the Holy Sword!"
CH9_Main_30_2_5,"Self-destruction!?"
CH9_Main_30_2_6,"Kasel!"
CH9_Main_30_2_7,"He's trying to self-destruct! Get out!"
CH9_Main_30_2_8,"Frey!"
CH9_Main_30_2_9,"...Wail..."
CH9_Main_30_2_10,"Legios!"
CH9_Main_30_2_11,"Waaaah!"
CH9_Main_30_2_12,"Ugh... You..."
CH9_Main_30_2_13,"Die... Malduk."
CH9_Main_30_2_14,"I won't give in till the very end... Hah..."
CH9_Main_30_2_15,"You really don't change... till the very end... Theo Phil Grayum."
CH9_Main_30_2_16,"But... it's too late..."
CH9_Main_30_2_17,"Rest for all eternity... my Master..."
CH9_Main_30_2_18,"Kuh!"
CH9_Main_30_2_19,"Kasel, are you alright!?"
CH9_Main_30_2_20,"Yeah, I'm fine."
CH9_Main_30_2_21,"That Malduk.. even till the last..."
CH9_Main_30_2_22,"Maria!"
CH9_Main_30_2_23,"You don't look so well."
CH9_Main_30_2_24,"I'm okay."
CH9_Main_30_2_25,"But what about Kasel?"
CH9_Main_30_2_26,"That explosion was filled with demonic energy... If something goes wrong..."
CH9_Main_30_2_27,"The man with the red lightning..."
CH9_Main_30_2_28,"He's coming here..."
CH9_Main_30_2_29,"Ah... Ahh..."
CH9_Main_30_2_30,"Your spear, Theo Phil Grayum has finally come to serve you."
CH9_Main_30_2_31,"Ahh... Theo."
CH9_Main_30_2_32,"Please hold on a bit longer. I will be back soon."
CH9_Main_30_2_33,"...!?"
CH9_Main_30_2_34,"Yes... I remember you now..."
CH9_Main_30_2_35,"Mr. Handsome, are you going to fight?"
CH9_Main_30_2_36,"We'll help. It's going to be a hard fight for you now."
CH9_Main_30_2_37,"Although things might be different if that child wakes up."
CH9_Main_30_2_38,"We'll help as well."
CH9_Main_30_2_39,"..."
CH9_Main_30_2_40,"You must be... Kasel."
CH9_Main_30_2_41,"How do you know me?"
CH9_Main_30_2_42,"I heard about you from a friend of mine."
CH9_Main_30_2_43,"I suppose you've come here to accomplish something."
CH9_Main_30_2_44,"Then, continue on to fulfill that goal of yours."
CH9_Main_30_2_45,"But..."
CH9_Main_30_2_46,"This is a fight between me and him, which we couldn't finish 100 years ago."
CH9_Main_30_2_47,"I do appreciate the offer."
CH9_Main_30_2_48,"..."
CH9_Main_30_2_49,"..."
CH9_Main_30_2_50,"...I understand."
CH9_Main_30_2_51,"Could you please tell us your name?"
CH9_Main_30_2_52,"Theo."
CH9_Main_30_2_53,"I am Theo Phil Grayum. A Knight of the Gray Republic."
CH9_Main_30_2_54,"We're now inside the transmission tower..."
CH9_Main_30_2_55,"And this might be..."
CH9_Main_30_2_56,"the device that could send us off to where my father is at..."
CH9_Main_30_2_57,"Are you ready?"
CH9_Main_30_2_58,"Yes."
CH9_Main_30_2_59,"No matter what comes after this..."
CH9_Main_30_2_60,"Let's put an end to it."
CH9_SUB_T_2_1_1,"Theo, a good friend of yours named Ezekiel"
CH9_SUB_T_2_1_2,"has asked to tell you about the next destination."
CH9_SUB_T_2_1_3,"This is the Swamps of Gargoss.."
CH9_SUB_T_2_1_4,"Traces of war... lingering scent of... blood..."
CH9_SUB_T_2_1_5,"This place is filled with sorrow."
CH9_SUB_T_2_1_6,"My Lady, the Gray Republic needs you."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_1,"Who are they? Why are they blocking our way?"
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_2,"Ughh..."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_3,"Uhh..."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_4,"Their eyes have already gone insane."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_5,"It's..."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_6,"It's his power."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_7,"Him?"
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_8,"The traitor from the Republic of Gray."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_9,"The one who opened the Demon's Gate out of greed so that he could become a demon."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_10,"The one who ruined his own country and offered it to the Dark Lord."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_11,"Malduk, the head court wizard..."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_12,"I will not forgive him."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_13,"I will show no mercy towards that traitor."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_1_14,"And that applies for the scraps he left behind."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_2_1,"Wow... Your lightning seems to have gotten stronger."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_2_2,"I was able to recover a part of Legios's power from the battle at the Desert."
CH9_SUB_T_10_1_2_3,"Wait, it was not as strong as it could've been?"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_1,"Hey! Wake up!"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_2,"Hey!"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_3,"Ugh..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_4,"What the hell!? What did you do to make your body heat up like this!?"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_5,"Argh!"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_6,"Stay with me, Theo!"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_7,"You shall become my spear... and become the pillar that guides my path..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_8,"I, Theo Phil Grayum, swear to become your knight and your spear."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_9,"To protect your kingdom as the pillar that supports it."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_10,"Ah..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_11,"You're finally awake."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_12,"Looks like... Legios's power was activated."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_13,"Yes, you've become really strong."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_14,"But don't wield it if you can't control it."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_15,"..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_16,"I see... I couldn't control it... I still have a long way to go..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_17,"Anyway, you can just stay here for now."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_18,"No, I don't have time to waste."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_19,"Listen to me, you can't handle this now."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_20,"What can you do when you keep passing out like that?"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_21,"As you saw, using Legios taxes my body..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_22,"Yes, I know. So, just stay put."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_23,"I'll look for that skeleton or whatever."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_24,"Along with that Lady of yours."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_25,"..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_26,"Hey."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_27,"Let me know if something happens."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_28,".. Hah hah... Got it..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_29,"For 100 years... I've been looking for your traces."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_30,"All I wanted to do was return to your side to fulfill my duty as your spear..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_31,"But even though I only had eyes for you, I ended up taking possession of many things."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_32,"I want to show them to you."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_33,"A black pillar?"
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_34,"That’s..."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_35,"My spear, the people are in danger. Please go stop the Berserk Golem."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_36,"My Lady!\nDon't worry about me, I'll protect this place."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_37,"I'll be here when you come back."
CH9_SUB_T_20_1_38,"That's the black pillar that destroyed the Republic of Gray..."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_1,"...He must be here."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_2,"You went missing, even before Lord Angmund was defeated. What brings you here now?"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_3,"And of all places.. this is the tower he's resting at..."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_4,"I will use all the corpses of these pesky humans for my experiments..."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_5,"No, you won't be able to do that now."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_6,"!?"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_7,"Wha..what the.."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_8,"Malduk..."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_9,"I'll definitely make sure you die today."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_10,"Why are you here!?"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_11,"The black pillar... You dare bring this again...?"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_12,"Just like back then..."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_13,"You're persistent, survivor of Gray!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_14,"Just like when you brought in all those demons by opening the gate!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_15,"Die!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_1_16,"Legios!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_1,"Kuh!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_2,"Damn it! Why!? Why are you here again!?"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_3,"...!?"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_4,"No... This is for the best..."
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_5,"Hah hah hah! Hah hah hah hah!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_6,"Yes, survivor of Gray... I will get rid of you today for sure!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_7,"Stop right there!"
CH9_SUB_T_21_1_2_8,"Yes, follow me! I will lead you to the one who'll put an end to you."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_1,"Yes..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_2,"Legios... I have only one scar left on my left arm."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_3,"Even though 100 years have passed, this scar from the divine beast still remains..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_4,"Come, the vessel of the transcendent."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_5,"He really is terrifying..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_6,"Mr. Handsome, you really fought against him 100 years ago!?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_7,"There were a few more."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_8,"(Huh? Does he mean that he was more of a monster then? But with his current power...)"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_9,"Anyway! Where's that Half breed at a time like this!?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_10,"...I will end this before he comes."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_11,"Heh... You act like you don't care, but you actually do?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_12,"Did you know that you have a son?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_13,"Hm, I already know about him and the other as well."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_14,"So, what about them?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_15,"As expected..you seem totally unmoved."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_16,"I guess that's what makes you a demon!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_1_17,"...Here I come."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_2_1,"This thrill! This wound! This power!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_2_2,"Ah hah hah hah! Rampage, Barbatos!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_1,"Wh-what's going on!?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_2,"*Pant* *Pant*"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_3,"This is not enough..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_4,"Come on, Demon..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_5,"That is all you got?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_6,"Where is the God of Lightning with his fearsome strength,"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_7,"who was not afraid to thrust his spear despite being wounded?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_8,"..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_9,"I already met someone I was supposed to meet here... So, this will be enough."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_3_10,"I will grant you time. I will wait until you can manage to actually entertain me."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_1,"Whew... He's gone..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_2,"...The scary person... is gone..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_3,"My Lady..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_4,"Theo..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_5,"Do you remember me?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_6,"Theo... My dear Theo..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_7,"Yes, it's me. Your spear... You look so weak..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_8,"You could say that she barely has any memories. Only bits and parts of it."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_9,"Malduk brought her back as an undead."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_10,"But even as an undead, she holds onto some of her memories and is able to communicate."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_11,"I guess you were really important to be called that, Mr. Handsome."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_12,"My Lady..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_13,"I will protect you from now on."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_14,"...My guardian... my spear."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_15,"You really are the same... It's beyond being naive and almost stupid..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_16,"I really want to possess Mr. Handsome if I can~!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_17,"..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_18,"Jane, do you even understand what I'm saying?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_19,"Wah! Found you!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_20,"Whoa! You scared me! You're finally here, Half breed."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_21,"Stop saying that!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_22,"Kyah!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_23,"What's with the mood here?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_24,"And this demonic energy... It's really familiar."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_25,"It's Legios."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_26,"What do you mean, Legios?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_27,"Are you hiding something?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_28,"No, I... Not really... No."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_29,"Huh? What's that? You just stuttered!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_30,"You're a terrible liar!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_31,"No, that's a misunderstanding."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_32,"I mean, Legios wailed."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_33,"..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_34,"..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_35,"..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_36,"Stop harassing him, demon."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_37,"Eh? What?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_38,"My Lady, it's all a misunderstanding. He is..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_39,"Huh? You..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_40,"An undead? With white hair?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_41,"I see, you must be Jane."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_42,"So, what are you going to do now?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_43,"I'm going to bring her back to normal."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_44,"What?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_45,"What are you talking about?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_46,"And I will revive the Republic of Gray and fulfill my duty as her spear."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_47,"What? Your duty?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_48,"I thought it was going to end with, they all lived happily ever after."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_49,"Isn't that what you wanted?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_50,"...?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_51,"My Lady is the Princess of the Republic of Gray. She should be in her rightful place."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_52,"That means it's obvious for me to stay by her side"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_53,"to help with the revival of the Republic of Gray."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_54,"What? Revival? You came for her to bring back that lost kingdom?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_55,"Well, that's not the only reason..."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_56,"Wow... That's more ambitious than I expected."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_57,"Hah hah, why are you going into the details, Half breed? You're not the smart type!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_58,"Hey!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_59,"Speaking of which, Ezekiel, will you come with me?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_60,"If you're able to help, I'm sure it will be very beneficial for us."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_61,"Huh? What do you mean? What are you going to do alone with that weak body of yours?"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_62,"Of course, I'm coming."
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_63,"Me, too! It sounds really fun! Yeah~! We've formed a party!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_64,"Hey you! Go away!"
CH9_Sub_T_30_1_4_65,"Kyah!"
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_1,"We're in the swamps."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_2,"And this place is referred to as the forbidden region in Orvelia."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_3,"We've lost more time than we expected."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_4,"I've been updating our contact along each section, just in case something happens."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_5,"But if we don't find them here, we should consider returning to the capital now."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_6,"I'm sorry to put you through this."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_7,"It's nothing."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_8,"Princess, I found their tracks."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_9,"They were definitely here a while ago."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_10,"And it hasn't been long since they left."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_11,"It's about time for us to meet them."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_12,"But what are we going to do about him once we get back to the capital?"
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_13,"You mean, Chase?"
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_14,"...I honestly don't trust him."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_15,"Even if we're fighting together right now, he was originally sent to assassinate you."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_16,"He's keeping quiet now, but if he starts rampaging again..."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_17,"I have already given him a name and appointed him as my knight."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_18,"But..."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_19,"I want you and Clause to take good care of him."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_20,"I was only able to take him in because you two are by my side."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_21,"...Your Highness."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_22,"Captain Demia."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_23,"I just can't figure out what the Princess is thinking sometimes."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_24,"Why does she insist on keeping that man close when he is a danger to us all?"
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_25,"I want you to always keep an eye on him."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_26,"He might be a bit of a klutz, but he seems okay."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_27,"Well, of course. He doesn't have any memories right now."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_28,"The way he talks... and how he keeps on trying to move based on instinct..."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_29,"*Sigh* How did this journey become like this?"
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_30,"Hah hah, things will work out somehow."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_31,"We all felt that way while making our way over here."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_32,"...Yes, it seems like the Warrior of the Holy Sword made steady progress."
CH9_Sub_S_3_1_33,"I can understand why the Princess wishes to meet him."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_1,"The Princess is back."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_2,"It's Captain Demia."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_3,"It's Clause... Did he finally decide to serve the Princess?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_4,"Who is that man?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_5,"His presence is overwhelming..."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_6,"Report."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_7,"The King is currently being treated by all of the royal doctors after a seizure."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_8,"And the Chancellor of Orvelia, Sir El Moriham, has left the capital."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_9,"You're here."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_10,"Sir Ricardo."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_11,"Grandpa?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_12,"Ricardo, Commander of the Holy Knights."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_13,"I have come personally because the situation is dire."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_14,"How is my father doing?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_15,"Thankfully, he has recovered quite a bit."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_16,"That is... good news..."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_17,"But my father's illness was not severe enough to take him down so quickly."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_18,"And even if he did get worse, he should not have recovered so quickly..."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_19,"It seems like it was his excuse to bring you back, Princess."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_20,"Why? What reason does he have to risk himself right now?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_21,"Even I cannot predict his actions that far ahead. No one knows what he might do next."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_22,"Sir Ricardo, then do you know the whereabouts of El Moriham?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_23,"Mm, we have confirmed that he has contacted with the higher nobles of the Empire."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_24,"He is publicly letting the people know that he has the Empire behind him,"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_25,"and now he's even moved out to the Empire?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_26,"That's the exact opposite of what he needs to do to gain trust from the nobles... but why?"
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_27,"..."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_28,"Something is definitely going on. And he seems to have left in a hurry."
CH9_Sub_S_17_1_29,"It's as if... he's evacuating from an upcoming war..."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_1,"Y-Your Highness! Urgent news!"
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_2,"Loman came with you?"
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_3,"Yes, Your Highness."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_4,"If you've come out here personally, it must be serious."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_5,"We have detected a giant trembling deep within the castle."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_6,"Here, in Orvelia Castle!?"
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_7,"Something is definitely off."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_8,"!?"
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_9,"If you're saying deep..."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_10,"Are you talking about... the ruins you reported from before?"
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_11,"No. It's coming from somewhere deeper."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_12,"...Something is happening."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_13,"Sir Ricardo."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_14,"Yes, Your Highness."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_15,"Assemble the Holy Knights and prepare to evacuate all the civilians to safety."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_16,"Yes, right away."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_17,"And if something happens, make sure to get them out of the castle immediately."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_18,"As you wish."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_19,"Demia, Clause, Chase and I will follow Loman to the origin of that tremble."
CH9_Sub_S_30_2_20,"Yes, Your Highness!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_1,"What are you doing out here?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_2,"Can't you see? I'm doing all the work since you and the old man aren't here."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_3,"Working hard?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_4,"You're just out here, trying to light things on fire."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_5,"Ah hah hah! You caught me."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_6,"I should've burned this mongrel as well..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_7,"You? Burn me?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_8,"Kya hah hah! Looks like you need to take a healthy dose of bullets to come to your senses."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_9,"Then, shall we start Round 2?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_10,"Who was the person you ran into?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_11,"Huh? Who? Oh, you mean the guy who beat her up?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_12,"Beat me up? Looks like our mongrel's eyesight is already starting to deteriorate?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_13,"Your sloppy shooting only got in the way!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_14,"Plus, you even got spanked by him."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_15,"Spanked? Did you just say spanked?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_16,"Don't worry, I'll help you treat your butt with this! Hah hah!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_17,"Huh, is that so?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_18,"But before that, have some of my bullets!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_19,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_20,"...Ack!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_21,"...Hic!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_22,"Look forward."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_23,"Enemies."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_24,"These guys look like they're trying to pick a fight from the start."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_25,"??"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_26,"Hey, what are you looking at?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_27,"Huh!? What did you say!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_28,"What is that idiot with the feelers saying to me?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_29,"He's kind of cute. Heh heh..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_30,"(We probably shouldn't get involved.)"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_31,"Mongrel..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_32,"Ezeki..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_33,"Hah, looks like you want to die, huh?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_34,"Oh, you want to die?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_35,"(It's over...)"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_36,"(It's done...)"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_37,"Hey, old man, we have to get rid of all of the non-Imperials from here, right!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_38,"And he's obviously a demon! Hah, of course we have to kill them!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_39,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_40,"What brings you here?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_41,"We're looking for someone. Ah, and there's one other person we want to kill."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_42,"Nothing good will come out of being here."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_43,"I would suggest you leave."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_44,"Unfortunately, we have no intention of doing that."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_45,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_46,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_47,"Hey, don't do anything. I'll blow them all away."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_48,"...Alright."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_49,"Huh?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_50,"But since they have three, you can take one of them."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_51,"I don't really want to fight them."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_52,"Hey, don't be like that!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_53,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_54,"Kya hah hah! Look at their beautiful teamwork!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_55,"Hey, old man. Let's wipe them out!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_56,"I'm not getting involved. Do what you want."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_57,"Huh!? How could you do that to us?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_58,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_59,"Isn't that a bit too much!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_60,"Your beloved subordinate was just blatantly ignored by a demon."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_61,"Well, you deserve to be ignored."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_62,"Shut up! You crazy girl!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_63,"Thank you for showing YOUR beautiful teamwork!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_64,"What!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_65,"What!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_66,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_67,"Ugh, whatever."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_68,"But first, I'm killing that one!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_1_69,"Kya hah hah! I want in!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_1,"Whoa! What was that!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_2,"!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_3,"That's enough. I won't stand by any longer."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_4,"I thought you weren't going to get involved?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_5,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_6,"Hey, hey!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_7,"!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_8,"They are my subordinates, after all."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_9,"Oh, old man! Nice one!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_10,"Alright, then let's get ready for Round 2!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_11,"We have 10 seconds until charge."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_12,"Yes, sir!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_2_13,"Kya! I'm so excited!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_1,"Now, old man!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_2,"!!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_3,"Wail, Legios!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_4,"!!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_5,"Kyaa!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_6,"He made that attack miss?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_7,"Kwaaaaah!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_8,"Hey! Get ahold of yourself! What's happening!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_9,"Damn it! He's a monster!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_10,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_11,"Ahh! Captain! Consecutive charges are dangerous! Big Sis said so!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_12,"...If we don't stop that, we're all going to die, anyway."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_13,"Protect the Captain, Pansirone!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_3_14,"I'll do what I want! Bleh!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_1,"...He's still fine!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_2,"Kuh!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_3,"Kwah! Ah... Ah."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_4,"Stay with me, man!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_5,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_6,"Waaaah! No more! It's 3 times in a row! This is crazy! No, you can't do it, Captain!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_7,"Kya! I don't know anymore!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_8,"Hey, you okay!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_9,"Damn it!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_10,"They're gone..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_11,"Whoa! Stop! Enough! Enough!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_12,"Hey, stop him!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_19_3_4_13,"Ah hah hah!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_1,"Wow... geez..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_2,"Come on, that feeler guy was the one who picked the fight, but the quiet one did all the work."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_3,"Well, our mongrel picked the fight... and the old man did all the fighting."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_4,"What!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_5,"Didn't you see his eyes?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_6,"If we didn't shoot first, we would have been killed for sure."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_7,"Ah, sure, sure."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_8,"(I'll have to talk with Cassandra when we return.)"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_9,"And what was that spear? Wasn't that insane? Of course, the old man's Akistra is also a mon..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_10,"I mean, a powerful weapon, but his was something else."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_11,"Kibera would have gone mad if he saw it."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_12,"That lunatic always goes mad when he sees a nice blade."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_13,"Although, if he were actually here, those pesky flies wouldn't dare to come at us."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_14,"And the old man could BOOM and blow 'em up in one shot."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_15,"Hmm..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_16,"Huh? Old man, Akistra seems a bit weird."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_17,"See? Sis told you not to use it consecutively..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_18,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_19,"But then again, it was too dangerous not to use it like that."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_20,"Right!?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_21,"Huh? What do you mean? The captain was just mad..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_22,"Just go along with me if you don't want to get killed by the captain."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_23,"..."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_24,"W-well, then... Should we go see Sis before going to Kibera?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_25,"Well? What do you think?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_26,"That sounds good! It was an emergency, so I'm sure she'll understand!"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_27,"...Very well, let's do that."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_28,"Do we really have to have him join us though?"
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_29,"He always makes fun of me."
CH9_Sub_Cr_20_3_30,"He makes fun of everyone. Stop talking and come on."
CH9_Sub_O_30_1_1,"Facing an enormous challenge..."
CH9_Sub_O_30_1_2,"Tears fall, and lead to more tears."
CH9_Sub_O_30_1_3,"The will to protect others has lost everything."
CH9_Sub_O_30_1_4,"The sword has found a new owner,"
CH9_Sub_O_30_1_5,"and its master walks a path"
CH9_Sub_O_30_1_6,"that leads to sorrow."
CH9_Sub_O_30_2_1,"The will to protect."
CH9_Sub_O_30_2_2,"Its faith has turned into despair."
CH9_Sub_O_30_2_3,"The faith that has turned away from this world is filled again with another light."
CH9_Sub_O_30_2_4,"Intertwining fates cannot be escaped."
CH9_Sub_O_30_2_5,"Standing still, with an empty needle in hand,"
CH9_Sub_O_30_2_6,"I am staring at it absent-minded."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_1,"The bond of eternity."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_2,"The light has become another darkness."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_3,"No,"
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_4,"the light is enveloped by the darkness."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_5,"But it has not disappeared."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_6,"Do not be sad."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_7,"It is the brilliant beginning of life."
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_8,"It will become the master of a more brilliant sword"
CH9_Sub_O_30_3_9,"and embrace everyone."
CH9_End_1,"Torment has brought more torment,"
CH9_End_2,"to bring out the sorrow."
CH9_End_3,"Faith has turned away from the world,"
CH9_End_4,"and another faith has turned into despair."
CH9_End_5,"Beliefs have fallen to chaos,"
CH9_End_6,"and vengeance has become hope."
CH9_End_7,"Of the four pillars that uphold this world,"
CH9_End_8,"the first pillar has been destroyed."
CH9_End_9,"One of the keys to open the world has fallen to the hands of another goddess."
CH9_End_10,"The one who is covered in darkness and destroyed the pillar."
CH9_End_11,"The one who holds brilliant life."
CH9_End_12,"The master of the light who is destined to return"
CH9_End_13,"is waiting for the call of your voice."
CH9_End_14,"King's Raid"
CH9_End_15,"Pandemonium"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_1,"Cleo, is there a magic you can use to hide your body or cover up your traces?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_2,"Well, it's possible. You can't completely erase all traces, but you won't be noticed unless it's by a wizard."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_3,"I see... It's hard to sense you unless I pay close attention."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_4,"Try to stay away from me from now on."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_5,"And no matter what happens, keep that magic cast."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_6,"Huh? What do you mean?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_7,"There's no need for that."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_8,"Wah? What?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_9,"..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_10,"You're the only target we're interested in."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_11,"Traitor Roi..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_12,"Traitor, huh?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_13,"I'm not stupid enough to follow rules that'll restrain you for life."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_14,"And I'm also not nice enough to show mercy towards anyone who calls me a traitor."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_15,"Hah hah hah..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_16,"Yes, you were the cruelest and most loyal member of the Laughing Masks..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_17,"I can still remember the surprise on the leader's face when you asked to quit being an assassin."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_18,"Although you were branded as a traitor, the leader still wants you to come back."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_19,"That's why we're going to ask you for the last time."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_20,"Come back, Roi."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_21,"To the Laughing Masks."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_22,"I'll say it again, then. I have no intention of going back there."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_23,"Hah hah... I thought you would say that."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_24,"I respect your decision."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_25,"I didn't have high expectations for you when you didn't do anything"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_26,"when our brothers were being killed by the Warrior of the Holy Sword."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_27,"Brothers? Hah, don't make me laugh."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_28,"The leader will probably give up on you now as well."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_29,"Beware..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_30,"From this moment forward, we'll be hiding in every shadow"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_31,"cast in the path you walk..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_32,"..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_33,"Looks like Tanya didn't come..."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_34,"Tanya?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_35,"An old friend of mine... A very shy one."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_36,"That sounds like a girl's name."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_37,"Hm? That's right."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_38,"Huh? But you know that she's really shy?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_39,"??"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_40,"How old is she!?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_41,"Hm... She probably turned 18 this year."
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_42,"What!? You even know her age!?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_43,"...What are you getting at?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_44,"You know her age and even her personality!"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_45,"You really know everything!"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_46,"!? What? What's the matter?"
CH9_Sub_C_18_1_47,"Hey, Cleo!"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_1,"Maria."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_2,"?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_3,"I have something to tell you."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_4,"What is it?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_5,"I'm sorry, but I overheard the talk you had with the Warrior of the Holy Sword from before."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_6,"..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_7,"My apologies."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_8,"Well, you already knew about all of that."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_9,"But there is something that's bothering me."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_10,"What would that be?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_11,"Just like last time,"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_12,"you left out something while explaining the power of the Dimension Rift."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_13,"..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_14,"Enough, let's move."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_15,"Maria..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_16,"I hope... you're not... planning on doing that."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_17,"What do you mean by that?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_18,"If the Warrior of the Holy Sword fails..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_19,"You're planning on using the Pandemonium Flower to... face King Kyle yourself..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_20,"..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_21,"Morrah."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_22,"That child..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_23,"He was not the person I had expected."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_24,"It might have been my own selfishness from the past that has caused everything to become difficult like this."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_25,"...I should not have said such things."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_26,"Perhaps I have been acting mean to hide that."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_27,"Because I could not even accept the truth on my own..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_28,"And because I didn't want to show it..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_29,"That's why I pushed others away from me, even if it hurt them..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_30,"But what about your pain, Maria?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_31,"When I looked into his honest eyes, everything felt stupid..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_32,"He looked like the man I've always admired."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_33,"The one I failed to hold onto, no matter how many times I tried..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_34,"Maria, please take care of him..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_35,"I'm glad that you're the one..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_36,"who is here to witness my final moments..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_37,"I don't want to use this flower if I don't have to."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_38,"But... I won't hesitate to use it if needed..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_39,"But..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_40,"Why did I go the long way around..?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_41,"I should have died 100 years ago."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_42,"Even with the overwhelming blessings of the Holy Dragon and the power I gained from him..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_43,"What have I been doing all this time?"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_44,"Maria..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_45,"It was a long journey, wasn't it? Ever since you and I met..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_46,"Without even counting Oricana's memories,"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_47,"you and I have been together for 100 years."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_48,"When you first came to call me out instead of him, I really hated you."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_49,"Maria..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_50,"Once this is all over, let's go see Oricana."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_51,"I think I can tell him now."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_52,"About how you have always been a good friend who stood by me..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_53,"..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_54,"Thank you, Morrah. Thank you for always staying with me."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_55,"Hah hah, it looks like I'm always apologizing to you for something."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_56,"I..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_57,"From now on, I want you to protect my saintess."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_58,"(Oricana... I finally managed to see the beautiful smile I've only seen through your memories.)"
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_59,"In the past, present, and future..."
CH9_Sub_M_18_1_60,"I will always protect you."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_1,"Congratulations. It's very encouraging to have the Magic Knights established in the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_2,"And you're the youngest."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_3,"Please stop making fun of me."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_4,"No, no, how could I do that? Now that you are a commander, you're higher rank than I am."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_5,"I already know that ranks of other organizations are meaningless to the Emperor's Royal Guards."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_6,"That makes it sound like we're some sort of a privileged class."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_7,"You're beyond that, actually."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_8,"Hah hah, please stop joking."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_9,"And..."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_10,"you don't have to stand outside."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_11,"Y-yes, sir!"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_12,"Reporting in."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_13,"What's the situation?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_14,"Due to the sudden appearance of a giant monster at the Swamps of Gargoss, the excavation has been halted."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_15,"Several casualties have occurred."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_16,"Hm..."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_17,"That's not good. It's a lot faster than we thought."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_18,"Yes, just like El Moriham's case... It's progressing fast."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_19,"Now demons will start surfacing within the Empire as well."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_20,"We've always fought them off in small scales, haven't we?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_21,"The fights were just not known publicly."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_22,"Yes, and this Empire was built from fighting other beings that are older than the demons."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_23,"Wait, it's like you're speaking about another nation's history."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_24,"Our family does not come from the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_25,"!?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_26,"We are the descendants of the Republic of Gray that was first destroyed during the Demon War."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_27,"This Veralta was also passed down from my great-grandfather who hailed from the Republic of Gray."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_28,"But the Royal Guards..."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_29,"That does not mean that I'm not loyal towards the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_30,"I was born and raised in the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_31,"However, my great-grandfather despised the Empire for just standing by when the Republic fell."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_32,"But at the same time, he was grateful to the Emperor for accepting our family into the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_33,"Growing under him, my values have formed an odd neutrality."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_34,"(He is a peculiar person...)"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_35,"Although the higher officials are making a fuss, we are already prepared to fight the demons."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_36,"Although there were some twisted attempts like the Evil Knights Project, it all ended well."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_37,"And the creation of your Magic Knights is one of the preparations we have carried out."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_38,"Above all, the Emperor already knew about all of this. That means that everyone was just dancing to his tune."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_39,"..."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_40,"Now, what else do you have to tell me?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_41,"Ah, yes! The man you spoke of appeared at the ruins."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_42,"He has successfully joined up and is currently moving northeast of the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_43,"Yes, and their last unit is located northeast..."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_44,"Ah, and everything you just heard... You know what to do?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_45,"Y-yes, sir!"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_46,"Do you really think he'll stay quiet?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_47,"Of course, the rumor will spread quietly. In fact, it has to spread."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_48,"The soldiers are not interested in what happens among the higher command."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_49,"There is only one thing they want to know about."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_50,"It's that the Hound Unit is reforming again."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_51,"And I need some of the higher people to know"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_52,"that I am the one who is forming the Hound Unit."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_53,"I also have to find the best talent for the upcoming war against the demons."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_54,"Hm, that's surprising. You actually have ambition?"
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_55,"No, not really."
CH9_Sub_Em_24_7_56,"But I hate it when someone else tries to interfere with my work apart from the Emperor..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_1,"Hah hah, welcome."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_2,"I'm sorry for the urgent summoning."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_3,"Hmm..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_4,"Oh, you must be having a rough time."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_5,"I perfectly understand. It is unusual to make such an urgent request to make such a big decision."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_6,"...That's why I want to make sure of this."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_7,"If you had waited a bit longer, the Princess would have been eliminated for sure."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_8,"Don't you think so?"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_9,"..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_10,"I apologize. That is entirely our fault. I have no excuses."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_11,"That's why we made the exception of inviting you over here."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_12,"It must be done in order to welcome the new age."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_13,"The kingdom will fall, and its pillars will crumble along with it."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_14,"How could something like that happen all of a sudden?"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_15,"Anyhow, that's better for me since I can't take them down individually..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_16,"Who exactly is this Red Witch?"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_17,"Only a few people know about that, even within the Empire."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_18,"I don't know the details, either."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_19,"..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_20,"It means that the Emperor has a high regard for her."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_21,"I thought you were abandoned by the Emperor."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_22,"Abandoned? Hah hah hah! Me?"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_23,"No, in fact, he saved me."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_24,"If it weren't for him, I would already be dead."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_25,"He has called upon me to accomplish a greater goal!"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_26,"...Hm."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_27,"And I can't just die like that."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_28,"Until the day I kill the ones who made me like this..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_29,"Out of all of them, I am going to strangle that arrogant hound myself."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_30,"I'll have him beg for mercy with tears in his eyes!"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_31,"I'll strangle him over and over..."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_32,"How dare... How dare he!?"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_33,"That filthy worthless dog!"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_34,"...Tsk."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_35,"Oh, my... I must have gotten too excited."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_36,"Come along, Pandora is waiting for you."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_37,"The new master of Orvelia is going to reestablish the fallen kingdom"
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_38,"and unite all of the nobles under a single flag."
CH9_Sub_Em_30_7_39,"Mmm... Very well."
CH95_Main_1_1_1,"Maria..."
CH95_Main_1_1_2,"Maria..."
CH95_Main_1_1_3,"You've come..."
CH95_Main_1_1_4,"*Clang!*"
CH95_Main_1_1_5,"*C-Clang!*"
CH95_Main_1_1_6,"*Clang!*"
CH95_Main_1_1_7,"*Skkttttt-!*"
CH95_Main_1_1_8,"*Claaang!*"
CH95_Main_1_1_9,"Maria, Maria!"
CH95_Main_1_1_10,"Where am I..."
CH95_Main_1_1_11,"You're awake!? Whew..."
CH95_Main_1_1_12,"What happened..."
CH95_Main_1_1_13,"You went unconscious."
CH95_Main_1_1_14,"As expected, the transmission device was connected to the Dark Lord's new castle."
CH95_Main_1_1_15,"This... overwhelming demonic energy..."
CH95_Main_1_1_16,"It seems like Malduk has successfully used the Dimension Rift to change all of the holy energy here into demonic energy."
CH95_Main_1_1_17,"Now this place is completely filled with demonic energy. It must be the most optimal location to restore the unstable power of the Dark Lord."
CH95_Main_1_1_18,"Kyle..."
CH95_Main_1_2_1,"It works."
CH95_Main_1_2_2,"Her theory was right. The power of the rift is casting away the power of the darkness."
CH95_Main_1_2_3,"Angmund's power isn't working!"
CH95_Main_1_2_4,"Let's go, Kasel!"
CH95_Main_1_3_1,"Kuh!"
CH95_Main_1_3_2,"Kasel, get back!"
CH95_Main_1_3_3,"Damn it... Where'd that come from!?"
CH95_Main_1_3_4,"Is it from back then!?"
CH95_Main_1_3_5,"Damn that Malduk. Still pestering us till the end..."
CH95_Main_1_4_1,"Looks like... we failed..."
CH95_Main_1_4_2,"I didn't expect his obsession would make things so complicated."
CH95_Main_1_4_3,"Maria..."
CH95_Main_1_4_4,"Haa!"
CH95_Main_1_4_5,"Fall!"
CH95_Main_1_4_6,"Kasel, get back!"
CH95_Main_1_4_7,"Kwaaaah!"
CH95_Main_1_5_1,"What? Did everything just turn back to normal?"
CH95_Main_1_5_2,"What the...?"
CH95_Main_1_5_3,"..."
CH95_Main_1_5_4,"Maria, are you...?"
CH95_Main_1_5_5,"You can't."
CH95_Main_1_5_6,"..."
CH95_Main_1_5_7,"Maria!"
CH95_Main_1_5_8,"I'm glad that you're the one..."
CH95_Main_1_5_9,"I'm glad you're here to witness my final moments..."
CH95_Main_1_5_10,"This was my role from the beginning."
CH95_Main_1_5_11,"Maria, please take care of him..."
CH95_Main_1_5_12,"That child must not be sacrificed..."
CH95_Main_1_5_13,"Not another soul... No more..."
CH95_Main_1_5_14,"Maria, please!"
CH95_Main_1_5_15,"...You."
CH95_Main_1_5_16,"It's okay..."
CH95_Main_1_5_17,"What are you saying..?"
CH95_Main_1_5_18,"You don't have to carry this burden alone anymore."
CH95_Main_1_5_19,"Ah..."
CH95_Main_1_5_20,"I'll be back."
CH95_Main_1_5_21,"I'll be back, Maria."
CH95_Main_1_5_22,"No..."
CH95_Main_1_5_23,"No..."
CH95_Main_1_5_24,"Please..."
CH95_Main_1_5_25,"Kyle... It's your son..."
CH95_Main_1_5_26,"Haaa!"
CH95_Main_1_5_27,"Kasel!"
CH95_Main_1_5_28,"Kasel!"
CH95_Main_1_6_1,"Father..."
CH95_Main_1_6_2,"Even at this very moment.."
CH95_Main_1_6_3,"when we are pointing our swords against each other.."
CH95_Main_1_6_4,"I just can't believe that"
CH95_Main_1_6_5,"you're actually my father..."
CH95_Main_1_6_6,"In all honesty..."
CH95_Main_1_6_7,"That's not important."
CH95_Main_1_6_8,"King Kyle, the one who sacrificed himself"
CH95_Main_1_6_9,"to save his loved ones."
CH95_Main_1_6_10,"And from watching the others who've sacrificed themselves"
CH95_Main_1_6_11,"to save you..."
CH95_Main_1_6_12,"I don't think what you did was wrong."
CH95_Main_1_6_13,"Even though people fear you now"
CH95_Main_1_6_14,"as the Dark Lord of Terror,"
CH95_Main_1_6_15,"I believe that you made"
CH95_Main_1_6_16,"the right choice back then."
CH95_Main_1_6_17,"Which is why..."
CH95_Main_1_6_18,"I'm choosing to be with you, for you."
CH95_Main_1_6_19,"And for everyone dear to me..."
CH95_Main_1_6_20,"I am... coming with you."
CH95_Main_1_6_21,"Stop him!"
CH95_Main_1_6_22,"!?"
CH95_Main_1_6_23,"Please stop him!"
CH95_Main_1_6_24,"Kasel!"
CH95_Main_1_6_25,"Haaaa!"
CH95_Main_1_6_26,"Father, let's go together..."
CH95_Main_1_6_27,"Thank... you."
CH95_Main_1_6_28,"Kasel!!!"
CH95_Main_1_6_29,"*Caw!*"
CH95_Main_1_6_30,"!?"
CH95_Main_1_6_31,"C-Cocytus?"
CH95_Main_1_6_32,"No!"
CH95_Main_1_6_33,"I am Lea, the one who commands creation from destruction..."
CH95_Main_1_6_34,"The one who has created a contract with my messenger should know... the cost of this contract has been fulfilled."
CH95_Main_1_7_1,"No way..."
CH95_Main_1_7_2,"This is... a lie, right?"
CH95_Main_1_7_3,"Ah... Ahhh... Ahhh..."
CH95_Main_1_7_4,"No... No..."
CH95_Main_1_7_5,"This can't be..."
CH95_Main_1_7_6,"I'll get you patched up soon."
CH95_Main_1_7_7,"Just hold on."
CH95_Main_1_7_8,"Kasel, just hold on."
CH95_Main_1_7_9,"It won't take long."
CH95_Main_1_7_10,"A wound like this is nothing."
CH95_Main_1_7_11,"With the blessings of Lua..."
CH95_Main_1_7_12,"I'll heal you back up..."
CH95_Main_1_7_13,"So, please... please..."
CH95_Main_1_7_14,"Why? Why..."
CH95_Main_1_7_15,"Why... isn't it working? Why..."
CH95_Main_1_7_16,"No, no, no... This can't be..."
CH95_Main_1_7_17,"Just a bit more... just a bit..."
CH95_Main_1_7_18,"It's okay... Frey..."
CH95_Main_1_7_19,"Kasel..."
CH95_Main_1_7_20,"Frey..."
CH95_Main_1_7_21,"The last memory that my father showed me..."
CH95_Main_1_7_22,"That was hope..."
CH95_Main_1_7_23,"So, I'll be waiting..."
CH95_Main_1_7_24,"I'll be waiting for the touch of the light"
CH95_Main_1_7_25,"that you guys will reach out to me..."
CH95_Main_1_7_26,"Morrah, what are you doing!?"
CH95_Main_1_7_27,"We have to kill him."
CH95_Main_1_7_28,"This... is the only chance we're going to get."
CH95_Main_1_7_29,"I won't let you do that!"
CH95_Main_1_7_30,"There's no way!"
CH95_Main_1_7_31,"Move aside, humans... I don't want to kill you."
CH95_Main_1_7_32,"He's already..."
CH95_Main_1_7_33,"!?"
CH95_Main_1_7_34,"Damn..."
CH95_Main_1_7_35,"Please..."
CH95_Main_1_7_36,"Save him..."
CH95_Main_1_7_37,"Please... save Kasel..."
CH95_Main_1_7_38,"Please... save him..."
CH95_Main_1_7_39,"Dear Lua... please... take my life instead..."
CH95_Main_1_7_40,"and spare him..."
CH95_Main_1_7_41,"You can't do this..."
CH95_Main_1_7_42,"You really.. can't do this to me..."
CH95_Main_1_7_43,"..."
CH95_Main_1_7_44,"Bring him back..."
CH95_Main_1_7_45,"Kasel..."
CH95_Main_1_7_46,"...Bring Kasel back.."
CH95_Main_1_7_47,"Bring him back!!!"
CH95_Main_1_7_48,"!!"
CH95_Main_1_7_49,"!?"
CH95_Main_1_7_50,"She's been affected as well..."
CH95_Main_1_7_51,"No, this energy..."
CH95_Main_1_7_52,"No... Not again..."
CH95_Main_1_7_53,"Lua... Lea... What do you... think we humans are?"
CH95_Main_1_7_54,"Both of you, get out of here."
CH95_Main_1_7_55,"Hold on, Maria. Something's different."
CH95_Main_1_7_56,"Something's... different?"
CH95_Main_1_7_57,"I can sense the same energy I felt when I was with the Holy Dragon Oricana from Kasel."
CH95_Main_1_7_58,"This is a clash between those two energies."
CH95_Main_1_7_59,"Although he is surrounded by powerful demonic energy, what's happening to Kasel is different from what happened to King Kyle."
CH95_Main_1_7_60,"Once all the energy is exhausted, he'll..."
CH95_Main_1_7_61,"You have to get out of here..."
CH95_Main_1_7_62,"Is that it?"
CH95_Main_1_7_63,"Then, we'll try to stop it."
CH95_Main_1_7_64,"You get out of here in the meantime."
CH95_Main_1_7_65,"You think you can handle that kind of power!? Don't be stupid!"
CH95_Main_1_7_66,"But make sure to save him."
CH95_Main_1_7_67,"Promise me, Maria."
CH95_Main_1_7_68,"...!?"
CH95_Main_1_7_69,"Why... Why are you doing this? Why... you fools..."
CH95_Main_1_7_70,"You... foolish... humans..."
CH95_Main_1_7_71,"Maria, please forgive me."
CH95_Main_1_7_72,"Don't do this to me... Not anymore... I'll be left alone again..."
CH95_Main_1_7_73,"Please... survive..."
CH9_Main_9_2_18_Plus,"The battle with Dark Lord... and the tangled web that connects Mother, you, and Father... but..."
CH9_Main_9_2_115_Plus,"Please come with us."
CH9_Main_9_2_143_Plus,"Now that everyone is here, let's make a fire and warm up."
CH9_Main_9_2_142_Plus,"Ahem! We were talking about this archmage's performance at the Dragia Volcano!"
CH95_Main_3_1_1,"Ugh..."
CH95_Main_3_1_2,"What happened...?"
CH95_Main_3_1_3,"The Orvel Castle is..."
CH95_Main_3_1_4,"...It's gone?"
CH95_Main_3_1_5,"What about the people!?"
CH95_Main_3_1_6,"Who are you..?"
CH95_Main_3_1_7,"..."
CH95_Main_3_1_8,"Why!? Why did you do this to our capital?"
CH95_Main_3_1_9,"Kuh!"
CH95_Main_3_2_1,"Chase!"
CH95_Main_3_2_2,"You're... okay."
CH95_Main_3_2_3,"I protect Princess."
CH95_Main_3_2_4,"I will kill you."
CH95_Main_3_2_5,"..."
CH95_Main_3_3_1,"Woooooo!"
CH95_Main_3_3_2,"Impossible... How could anyone be this powerful?"
CH95_Main_3_3_3,"Why are you doing this!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_4,"Princess! Watch out!"
CH95_Main_3_3_5,"Kuh!"
CH95_Main_3_3_6,"Chase!"
CH95_Main_3_3_7,"I protect... the one who gave me my name..."
CH95_Main_3_3_8,"I protect..."
CH95_Main_3_3_9,"Enough! I'm fine! Just get back!"
CH95_Main_3_3_10,"I will, no matter what..."
CH95_Main_3_3_11,"!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_12,"Yugo..."
CH95_Main_3_3_13,"!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_14,"No!"
CH95_Main_3_3_15,"Why... Why... did Radi have to die?"
CH95_Main_3_3_16,"Yugo, it's not your fault..."
CH95_Main_3_3_17,"Yugo... my Yugo... I'm sorry..."
CH95_Main_3_3_18,"N-No! No..."
CH95_Main_3_3_19,"No... no... Erina..."
CH95_Main_3_3_20,"You are... too good of a man to die."
CH95_Main_3_3_21,"Go, live on... and comfort their souls."
CH95_Main_3_3_22,"I truly hope that your sorrow does not become hatred...\nDon't worry. I will surely tell her about all this..."
CH95_Main_3_3_23,"So, don't waste your life here."
CH95_Main_3_3_24,"This terrible war all started from a misunderstanding."
CH95_Main_3_3_25,"You should not blame the Princess for it."
CH95_Main_3_3_26,"You should not... blame the Princess."
CH95_Main_3_3_27,"Chase!"
CH95_Main_3_3_28,"!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_29,"Are you alright, Chase!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_30,"...I..."
CH95_Main_3_3_31,"What have... I...?"
CH95_Main_3_3_32,"You are the Princess... who gave me my name..."
CH95_Main_3_3_33,"!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_34,"Get away from the Princess!"
CH95_Main_3_3_35,"!?"
CH95_Main_3_3_36,"You are..."
CH95_Main_3_3_37,"Kasel?"
CH95_Main_4_1_1,"Wh-what's going on!?"
CH95_Main_4_1_2,"Kasel!? Are you Kasel!?"
CH95_Main_4_1_3,"Kasel!"
CH95_Main_4_1_4,"Wake up!"
CH95_Main_4_1_5,"Haaa!"
CH95_Main_4_1_6,"No... this can't be..."
CH95_Main_4_2_1,"Clause, get ahold of yourself!"
CH95_Main_4_2_2,"This is a lie..."
CH95_Main_4_2_3,"You've... become the Dark Lord?"
CH95_Main_4_2_4,"Frey?"
CH95_Main_4_2_5,"..."
CH95_Main_4_2_6,"Why... why did... you all become..."
CH95_Main_4_2_7,"Why... what happened..."
CH95_Main_4_2_8,"Why did you all become like this..?"
CH95_Main_4_2_9,"Wake up..."
CH95_Main_4_2_10,"It's me..."
CH95_Main_4_2_11,"Kasel... it's your brother..."
CH95_Main_4_2_12,"Frey... it's me... Frey..."
CH95_Main_4_2_13,"Wake up!!"
CH95_Main_4_2_14,"You idiot!"
CH95_Main_4_2_15,"Ugh!"
CH95_Main_4_2_16,"Get ahold of yourself! Clause!"
CH95_Main_4_2_17,"Grandfather?"
CH95_Main_4_2_18,"Holy Knights of Orvelia! Bring down the Dark Lord, now!"
CH95_Main_4_2_19,"I'm not a knight, but I've been waiting to hear that!"
CH95_Main_4_2_20,"Blessings of Lua..."
CH95_Main_4_2_21,"Alright, it's time to roll!"
CH95_Main_4_2_22,"I will help, too."
CH95_Main_4_3_1,"No... No! Stop!"
CH95_Main_4_3_2,"Clause, what are you doing!?"
CH95_Main_4_3_3,"Grandfather, it's Kasel... He's not the Dark Lord..."
CH95_Main_4_3_4,"!?"
CH95_Main_4_3_5,"..."
CH95_Main_4_3_6,"Move aside, Clause."
CH95_Main_4_3_7,"He is the Dark Lord."
CH95_Main_4_3_8,"I told you to move aside."
CH95_Main_4_3_9,"I won't... do you even know..."
CH95_Main_4_3_10,"how hard he tried to.. save everyone...?"
CH95_Main_4_3_11,"He stepped up and endured through so much pain... for everyone..."
CH95_Main_4_3_12,"We can't do this..."
CH95_Main_4_3_13,"Gramps! I can't hold any longer!"
CH95_Main_4_3_14,"He's a total monster!"
CH95_Main_4_3_15,"Come quickly!"
CH95_Main_4_3_16,"Kasel is... the Dark Lord now."
CH95_Main_4_3_17,"Grandfather... that's Kasel..."
CH95_Main_4_3_18,"Move, now!"
CH95_Main_4_3_19,"He's my brother!"
CH95_Main_4_3_20,"!!"
CH95_Main_4_3_21,"Wake up, Clause!"
CH95_Main_4_3_22,"It's your duty to protect the people!"
CH95_Main_4_3_23,"..."
CH95_Main_4_3_24,"Princess..."
CH95_Main_4_3_25,"I will join you right away."
CH95_Main_4_3_26,"Yes, Princess."
CH95_Main_4_3_27,"Princess... I.. I can't do this..."
CH95_Main_4_3_28,"If you can't raise your sword, stay there."
CH95_Main_4_3_29,"You will only get in the way."
CH95_Main_4_3_30,"Sir Clause."
CH95_Main_4_4_1,"This guy is no joke!"
CH95_Main_4_4_2,"I-I'm barely withstanding his attacks!"
CH95_Main_4_5_1,"Are you really Kasel!?"
CH95_Main_4_5_2,"Open your eyes, Kasel!"
CH95_Main_4_5_3,"Don't give in to the power of the demons!"
CH95_Main_4_5_4,"Ugh... even Frey..."
CH95_Main_4_6_1,"This is...hopeless..."
CH95_Main_4_6_2,"What is this strength? If all demons have such power..."
CH95_Main_4_6_3,"That's his original strength, I believe."
CH95_Main_4_6_4,"The demonic power must have forcefully pulled out all of his potential."
CH95_Main_4_6_5,"He has now become a mere tool that goes beyond the limits of his physical capability and the rule of nature."
CH95_Main_4_6_6,"The Dark Lord has left the capital!"
CH95_Main_4_6_7,"The capital is not their target?"
CH95_Main_4_6_8,"Then, what..."
CH95_Main_4_6_9,"They're headed towards the World Tree."
CH95_Main_4_6_10,"The World Tree!?"
CH95_Main_4_6_11,"What should we do? Do we go after them?"
CH95_Main_4_6_12,"We have to get the people to safety first."
CH95_Main_4_6_13,"Clause!"
CH95_Main_4_6_14,"That fool!"
CH95_Main_4_6_15,"Chase!"
CH95_Main_4_6_16,"Princess... I..."
CH95_Main_4_6_17,"..."
CH95_Main_4_6_18,"You don't have to say anything. But please follow him for now."
CH95_Main_4_6_19,"Please."
CH95_Main_4_6_20,"Very well."
CH95_Main_4_6_21,"We'll go with him."
CH95_Main_4_6_22,"Please save him..."
CH95_Main_5_1_1,"Kasel!"
CH95_Main_5_1_2,"Stop, Kasel!"
CH95_Main_5_2_1,"Kasel, open your eyes!"
CH95_Main_5_2_2,"It's your brother! Clause!"
CH95_Main_5_2_3,"..."
CH95_Main_5_2_4,"Please!"
CH95_Main_5_3_1,"*Huff* *Huff*"
CH95_Main_5_3_2,"What is... going on..."
CH95_Main_5_3_3,"Kasel..."
CH95_Main_5_3_4,"No... matter what..."
CH95_Main_5_4_1,"Clause..."
CH95_Main_5_4_2,"Yes... it's me... it's Clause..."
CH95_Main_5_4_3,"Clause... save me..."
CH95_Main_5_4_4,"I'll save you soon..."
CH95_Main_5_4_5,"I will save you both..."
CH95_Main_5_4_6,"No... matter what..."
CH95_Main_6_1_1,"This is only the beginning."
CH95_Main_6_1_2,"I don't know how he knew,"
CH95_Main_6_1_3,"but El Moriham must have predicted what would happen to Orvel."
CH95_Main_6_1_4,"Does that mean he's working with the demons?"
CH95_Main_6_1_5,"We can't rule out that possibility."
CH95_Main_6_1_6,"The Empire... and the demons... what's going on?"
CH95_Main_6_1_8,"In order to take over Orvelia..."
CH95_Main_6_1_9,"You look like you've totally given up."
CH95_Main_6_1_10,"Why... why is this happening to them?"
CH95_Main_6_1_11,"He did the best he could."
CH95_Main_6_1_12,"He fought to protect his beliefs, hopes, and everyone else."
CH95_Main_6_1_13,"However, there was some giant monster that swallowed up everything."
CH95_Main_6_1_14,"Tell me..."
CH95_Main_6_1_15,"What exactly happened?"
CH95_Main_6_1_16,"It's a long story."
CH95_Main_6_1_17,"Kasel, Frey..."
CH95_Main_6_1_18,"He has fallen.. into the depths of darkness that Lea has created."
CH95_Main_6_1_19,"..."
CH95_Main_6_1_20,"Here come your friends."
CH95_Main_6_1_21,"Lua's dogs wouldn't like seeing me with you."
CH95_Main_6_1_22,"You..."
CH95_Main_6_1_23,"I better go now. There's no time to lose."
CH95_Main_6_1_24,"As more time passes, Kasel's consciousness will fall deeper into the darkness."
CH95_Main_6_1_25,"Once he is completely taken over... there will be no return."
CH95_Main_6_1_26,"Just like him...Kyle."
CH95_Main_6_1_27,"..."
CH95_Main_6_1_28,"What are you going to do now?"
CH95_Main_6_1_29,"I will go to the land where everything began."
CH95_Main_6_1_30,"You mean Galluah?"
CH95_Main_6_1_31,"No, it's a place older than that. A place where old gods, humans, and transcendants all lived together..."
CH95_Main_6_1_32,"There is something I must find."
CH95_Main_6_1_33,"What are you looking for?"
CH95_Main_6_1_34,"A way to kill the goddess."
CH95_Main_6_1_35,"The... goddess?"
CH95_Main_6_1_36,"Yes, I'm going to kill the goddess."
CH95_Main_6_1_7_Plus,"Now that the capital is decimated, he'll make his move."
CH95_Main_99_1_1,"A twisted darkness has formed around the old Dark Lord's Castle."
CH95_Main_99_1_2,"Those that should not exist are here,"
CH95_Main_99_1_3,"and they will disturb the nature of this world."
CH95_Main_99_1_4,"As the power of darkness grows stronger,"
CH95_Main_99_1_5,"the rift will grow larger as well."
CH95_Main_99_1_6,"You who wield the power..."
CH95_Main_99_1_7,"Please stop the chaos that will sweep across this world..."
CH95_Main_99_2_1,"Due to the first artifact that has been corrupted by the darkness,"
CH95_Main_99_2_2,"the twisted rift of darkness has grown larger and stronger."
CH95_Main_99_2_3,"You who wield the power,"
CH95_Main_99_2_4,"please overcome this trial in order to gain more power."
CH95_Main_99_2_5,"May the goddess watch over your destiny..."
CH95_Main_2_1_1,"What's going on...?"
CH95_Main_2_1_2,"Frey..?"
CH95_Main_2_1_3,"Kasel..??"
CH95_Main_2_1_4,"Watch out!"
CH95_Main_2_1_5,"Kuh!!"
CH95_Main_2_1_6,"What? What happened!?"
CH95_Main_2_1_7,"Did he become corrupted!?"
CH95_Main_2_1_8,"Damn it!"
CH95_Main_2_1_9,"Cleo, look out!"
CH95_Main_2_1_10,"Roi!"
CH95_Main_2_1_11,"Open up a portal and run. Now! I know you can do it."
CH95_Main_2_1_12,"What are you talking about!?"
CH95_Main_2_1_13,"Kasel and Frey are right there!"
CH95_Main_2_1_14,"Are you trying to let that human, Roi die!?"
CH95_Main_2_1_15,"!!"
CH95_Main_2_1_16,"Kuh!"
CH95_Main_2_1_17,"..."
CH95_Main_2_1_18,"Ahh...!"
CH95_Main_2_1_19,"....Damn it!"
CH95_Main_2_1_20,"Roi... wake up, Roi!"
CH95_Main_2_1_21,"Haaaa!"
CH95_Main_2_1_22,"Hurry!!"
CH95_Main_2_1_23,"Frey... Kasel..."
CH95_Main_2_1_24,"History... has repeated itself..."
CH95_Main_2_1_25,"The goddess has used you as a tool as well..."
CH95_Main_2_1_26,"Maria, please hold on tight."
CH95_Main_2_1_27,"Just a little bit more!"
CH95_Main_2_1_28,"This place is..."
CH95_Main_2_1_29,"Be careful!!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_1,".... What is all this...?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_2,"Roi... this is... all a lie, right?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_3,"...I wish it were..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_4,"This can't be... this is impossible!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_5,"Kasel! You idiot! Answer me!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_6,"Frey! Where are you!? Come out already!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_7,"...Cleo."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_8,"Those idiots... Why... Why!?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_9,"... Come out here already... we've always... been together..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_10,"How could you guys... just leave me like this...?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_11,"Why did you guys... let us live if this was going to happen to you!?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_12,"I hate... *Sob...*"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_13,"Waaaaaaaaah!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_14,"................................"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_15,"...Are you done crying?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_16,"Yes, I'm done. That's enough tears!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_17,"Now we have to find a way to turn Kasel and Frey back to normal."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_18,"Those two... even after becoming the Dark Lord, they still let us live."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_19,"... They might still have some of their consciousness left in them."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_20,"That means... there's still hope."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_21,"I, the genius archmage will definitely turn them back to normal!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_22,"Now that's the Cleo I know."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_23,"Ha! Then, was the Roi who was just crying with his back turned the same Roi I know?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_24,"...I wasn't crying. It was just.. some dust got in my eyes."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_25,"Hm, then are we heading to the Tower of Sage first?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_26,"Yeah, I think that's the only choice we have."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_27,"The Tower of Sage... I really don't want to go back there..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_28,"But I haven't seen any other wizard who's stronger than the old man... Hmpf..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_29,"Shouldn't you... worry about getting punished first?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_30,"Considering all that treasure and forbidden literature that you snuck out with you..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_31,"Shut up, Roi! They were all going to be mine, anyway!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_32,"I don't care about getting scolded or punished by Grandpa."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_33,"As long as I can find a way to bring Kasel and Frey back to us...."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_34,"I'm willing to do anything."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_35,"Agreed."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_36,"Then, let's hurry, Cleo."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_2_37,"Yeah! Okay, Roi."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_1,"Princess, we've nearly completed our search for the victims near the palace as you have ordered."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_2,"We were able to proceed with the task swiftly with the assistance of Sir Ricardo's soldiers."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_3,"It must have been a burden for Commander Ricardo."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_4,"We've confirmed that there were no civilian casualties."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_5,"However..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_6,"My father must be still missing."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_7,"...Yes. We will try to expand our search efforts."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_8,"Please hurry."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_9,"Although we haven't made any official statements, there are eyes and ears throughout the palace."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_10,"The nobles who are supporting the Chancellor must have started to act by now."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_11,"If they end up finding my father first..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_12,"Do not worry, we will find our King first."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_13,"What should we do in regard to rebuilding the town and the support requests from nearby domains?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_14,"I've already told Loman about the orders from the Princess regarding those matters."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_15,"Sir Ricardo."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_16,"Your Highness, we've finished rescuing all of the civilians."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_17,"Lucias and the priests are doing their best to recover the victims."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_18,"So, you won't have to worry about the people anymore."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_19,"I'm glad he was at the palace during this crisis."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_20,"The rest of our forces are currently moving all of the treasures from the Underground Vault."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_21,"However, are you sure about opening up Underground Vault on your own, Your Highness?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_22,"Since we're supposed to use them for the Kingdom and its people, my ancestors would have gladly given them away too."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_23,"Do you think the nobles will accept this?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_24,"Only the King is allowed... to open up the Underground Vault."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_25,"Hmm..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_26,"If they start claiming that the Princess opened up the vault"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_27,"in order to harm the King and take the throne, it will put you in a dangerous position."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_28,"Since they have always claimed that the Princess is a threat to the throne,"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_29,"there's no way they will just let this pass."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_30,"I'm just worried about providing them with an opening like this."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_31,"I've already given that some thought."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_32,"Send out a messenger to Marquis Wales."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_33,"Princess! Are you thinking about letting that snake into the palace!?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_34,"If the throne stays empty, the nobles supporting the Chancellor will ramp up the pressure against us."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_35,"There is no doubt that they will start becoming more active."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_36,"Most of the nobles are busying themselves with exploiting this situation instead of taking care of the people."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_37,"In order to protect the Kingdom from those sly rats, we need someone who truly cares for the people and will act with caution."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_38,"I need the support from someone who can... influence the nobles more than I can."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_39,"..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_40,"It is true that he garnered astounding support from the nobles despite his young age."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_41,"Although he can shake people's values with nothing but a single whisper,"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_42,"he has always been nonchalant in the assembly and remained neutral."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_43,".."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_44,"On top of that, El Moriham has always wanted Marquis Wales for himself."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_45,"The fact that the Princess and the Chancellor both want the same person in this situation is a risky gamble."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_46,"How can you trust that he will work for the people when he has never actually revealed his own intentions?"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_47,"I understand that you are all concerned."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_48,"But... just trust me on this."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_49,"But, Your Highness!"
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_50,"Demia."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_51,"..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_52,"Very well, then."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_53,"Thank you, Demia."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_54,"I will not hesitate any longer..."
CH95_Sub_KingsPlains_1_55,"To protect my people."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_1,"The World Tree, the source of all creation..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_2,"Ah..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_3,"It seems like your dream has come true..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_4,"We were too late."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_5,"The Holy Sword, along with the warrior, were engulfed by the darkness in the end..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_6,"Dear Lua, Mother of Creation, why have you abandoned your chosen one...?"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_7,"I do not understand your intentions..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_8,"This is outrageous..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_9,"The Warrior of the Holy Sword..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_10,"The warrior who was supposed to save our world..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_11,"...."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_12,"You've all met him before."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_13,"He must have done the best he could."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_14,"Ominous winds are blowing."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_15,"Lorraine, what will become of our homes?"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_16,"..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_17,"Since the World Tree is destroyed, the entire world will be shrouded by the darkness."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_18,"Good has fallen, and evil will begin a new dark age across these lands."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_19,"Endless hordes of demonic beasts will swarm out of the rifts."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_20,"This will be the start of an endless battle."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_21,"...I made up my mind when my sister passed away."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_22,"I will carry on her dignity as a Harpy Warrior myself..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_23,"I am ready to join the battlefield at a moment's notice."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_24,"I also feel the same way."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_25,"But our strength alone still won't be enough to stop them."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_26,"We must form a combined defense line with all the other races throughout the continent."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_27,"A fine decision, Princess."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_28,"...Although I don't like this, I will try to contact the Dark Elves as well."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_29,"There's an old acquaintance who could be helpful..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_30,"His name was... Dimael I believe."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_31,"...Yes."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_32,"Ironically, he is currently in charge of commanding the forces of Arrovina."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_33,"I wonder how he escaped the Evil Seed... He's so persistent."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_34,"Considering your negative attitude towards him, you seem to know a lot about him, Princess."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_35,"Ha, I just overheard some stories told by the scouts."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_36,"He probably hasn't forgotten the help he received from Elidora 100 years ago."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_37,"If you reach out to him, I'm sure he will gladly accept our request."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_38,"I'm not really sure about this... but I hope that's the case."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_39,"Considering the situation, we must do everything we can."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_40,"Then, I will join the battle as well."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_41,"What? No! What we're facing is no joke, Dosarta!"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_42,"Everyone is ready to risk their lives..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_43,"I can't just stay behind in this tower and watch!"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_44,"Let me take on the responsibility of protecting this world as well!"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_45,"You...!"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_46,"Dosarta must be thinking the exact same thing."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_47,"Please let me join you! I'm sure I can help out!"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_48,"Ah..."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_49,"It will be best to start gathering all of the races together as soon as day breaks."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_50,"...We will be facing difficult trials, the likes of which we've never seen before."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_51,"We must all be ready to give up our lives in order to protect the world."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_52,"You're right."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_53,"Let us show them that"
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_54,"hope has not yet disappeared from our hearts."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_55,"Kasel, I know that you sacrificed yourself trying to save the world."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_56,"We will carry on your will."
CH95_Sub_Elidora_1_57,"We will also never shirk our duty to face evil."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_1,"Laias is running late..."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_2,"It's okay. I'm sure that Laias's efforts stopped the demon attacks."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_3,"But then, she went after that Mad Dragon Temeraire..."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_4,"I can't help but worry about her. Well, she's really strong, so I'm sure she's fine."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_5,"Zafir, you just worry too much. Hahaha."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_6,"Ah! Finally, someone's here!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_7,"Hi! Can I ask you something? We're looking for someone."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_8,"He's a very cute and small boy! Have you seen anyone like him?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_9,"Um... well, I haven't seen a young boy like that around."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_10,"Hm, really? Where has he gone...? I can't find him anywhere..."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_11,"By the way, it's really noisy back there! Is it okay to just leave them like that?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_12,"Yes, of course."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_13,"They're always like that. Ha ha."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_14,"Why!? Why can't I go look for her!?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_15,"Weren't you listening!? She told us to guard this place from any possible demon attacks!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_16,"But she's running so late! And she's facing that crazy Temeraire!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_17,"Ha, that stupid dragon is no match for her."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_18,"I mean.. that's true! Of course I know that!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_19,"But... it's just...! I've been getting a bad feeling about this!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_20,"...Ugh. I've been feeling the same thing... I can't exactly tell what it is, though..."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_21,"Ahh, now you're confusing me! You knucklehead!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_22,"What? You can't explain what you're feeling, either, you brat!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_23,"Oh, I get it now! They seem really close!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_24,"See? They're both lovely children."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_25,"Wow, she's so tall!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_26,"Is she a barbarian?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_27,"Big sis! / Sis!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_28,"Ha! I told you, you dummy! I told you she'd be okay!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_29,"Did I say that she was weak!? I was just worried about her!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_30,"Ha ha, I see. Thank you for worrying about me, Neraxis."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_31,"O-of course I would worry about you!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_32,"S-Sis! I was worried about you as well...! But you...!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_33,"Yes, I understand how you felt as well. Thank you, Lilia."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_34,"I thought everything would be resolved once I caught up to Temeraire, but too many things happened."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_35,"That's why I took so long. I'm sorry for making you all worry."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_36,"It's good to see you as well, Zafir and Laudia. Did I keep you all waiting?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_37,"No, I'm just glad that you're okay."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_38,"It's great to see you again, Laias."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_39,"I'm glad to see that this place is still safe."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_40,"Huh? What do you mean... by safe?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_41,"I felt the darkness shrouding near the World Tree on my way back."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_42,"And the evil demonic energy is swarming at Orvel as well... I just keep having this bad feeling."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_43,"What? That means...!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_44,"The bad feeling I've been having must have been that... Hm."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_45,"That's why I'm worried about Kasel's party as well. They should be safe, though, since they went somewhere else."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_46,"What? Kasel!?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_47,"You met Kasel? And Roi? Where did they go?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_48,"I guess you know each other? Hm... they mentioned the Swamps of Gargoss, so I suppose they went there."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_49,"Ugh. Really? Should we go see if he's okay...?"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_50,"With all of these ominous things happening, I can't help but feel uneasy."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_51,"...I think it would be best to return to the Empire."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_52,"I'm worried about Roi as well, but I need to tell Mother and Master about these events."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_53,"Yes, they can take care of themselves. Don't worry about them."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_54,"Yeah! Thanks for the info! Bye now!"
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_55,"Ah, at least tell me... your name. Ha ha, she's gone already."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_56,"Haha, she's certainly very energetic."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_57,"Zafir, Laudia."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_58,"We have to prepare against the omens. For our... I mean, for the sake of the world."
CH95_Sub_Aegina_1_59,"As you wish, Priestess of Water."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_1,"...It seems like Maria failed in the end."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_2,"Hahaha... Well, I never really cared. I expected her to fail from the start."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_3,"Even so, it was very enjoyable to watch her heart change around like that."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_4,"That tenacious light of her soul that never ebbs despite failure..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_5,"Ah, I just can't resist it..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_6,"...What a bad taste you have."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_7,"I already knew about your true nature..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_8,"But I can see why she told me to be careful."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_9,"Haha, did the Red Witch say that about me?"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_10,"I didn't think that the two of you thought so highly of me."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_11,"It's an honor, Sage of the Sword from another world."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_12,"..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_13,"Don't worry, Nyx."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_14,"I have no intention of interfering or harming you."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_15,"But since you are only observing the situation in the first place,"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_16,"we won't run into each other, anyway. Hahaha..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_17,"...So. What are you going to do now?"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_18,"Did you find what you were looking for?"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_19,"Haha, the Transcendant information is being gathered."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_20,"The Transcendant of Lightning who is trying to awake the new God of Lightning through the two Divine Beasts."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_21,"The Transcendant of Earth who is dreaming a lie within the mountain of machines."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_22,"The Transcendant of Water who went into hiding by moving the Kingdom to a valley of the deep."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_23,"The Transcendant of Darkness, who is wandering without any goal in life, left alone deep underground."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_24,"It won't be long until"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_25,"all of the Transcendant powers gather in one place..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_26,"Based on your nature, you're probably not trying to take those powers for your own."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_27,"Are you trying to reach the key by exploiting those powers?"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_28,"Haha, let's just say that's the case."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_29,"You could say that I'm just continuing"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_30,"what the Technomagic Kingdom... failed to do in the past."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_31,"Once all reason and fate of this world are broken,"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_32,"what will become of this world, distant from the influence of God?"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_33,"Ah, it feels amazing, just thinking about it."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_34,"Hahaha... Ahahaha!"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_35,"*...Sigh*"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_36,"You revealed the truth of this world to someone like her..."
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_37,"...Is this part of your plan as well?"
CH95_Sub_Gargoss_1_38,"Seraphine..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_1,"Urgh...!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_2,"Pavel! Don't do this!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_3,"Step aside, Rodina."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_4,"Calm down, Pavel! This isn't like you!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_5,"At least give me an explanation!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_6,"Don't make me repeat myself."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_7,"Step aside or I'll...!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_8,"I can't do that!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_9,"Rodina!"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_10,"Pavel, I'm here... Huh?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_11,"Oh, did I come at a bad time?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_12,"You're here..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_13,"..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_14,"Hey, you. Rodina?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_15,"Yes?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_16,"Sorry, but could you give us a moment?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_17,"I just have something to talk over with Pavel here. Is that okay with you?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_18,"... Very well."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_19,"But please refrain from saying anything that would aggravate Pavel."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_20,"He's very sensitive at the moment."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_21,"Well... I can already tell."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_22,"I'll ask him about it. Just hang tight, Bear Lady."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_23,"Yes, of course."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_24,"..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_25,"So, what's going on?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_26,"I've never seen you so angry. After all, you usually prefer to live quietly, away from the world."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_27,"I sensed this great demonic energy from far south. I assume it's near Orvelia..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_28,"What? Uh, Pavel... Do you realize how far Orvelia is from here?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_29,"If you sense demonic energy from that far..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_30,"Wait, wait... It can't be. That's impossible..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_31,"As long as I know, there is only one entity that can emit such darkness."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_32,"Pavel, it's been a century since Angmund died. You know that."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_33,"I never said that it was Angmund."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_34,"But if that demonic energy from the south wasn't from Angmund..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_35,"It means that some other entity of darkness has appeared to replace him."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_36,"Are you sure about that? Did you really feel such powerful demonic energy?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_37,"You know very well that I'm not very good at joking around."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_38,"And there's something else that's even more important."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_39,"I need to go see... what happened to Arlette's child by myself."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_40,"I may have gotten too worked up before... But I need to go this time."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_41,"*Sigh...* I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think now is the time for you to act."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_42,"You're being watched, and that Bear Lady is worried about you."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_43,"Are you talking about Rodina? I appreciate that she's concerned for me..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_44,"But she is also just someone sent by the Empire to keep an eye on me. I won't have a choice if she interferes..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_45,"It sounds like you're going to get rid of anyone who gets in your way..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_46,"Alright then, how about this? I'll go check out Orvelia instead."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_47,"I want to see if what you're saying is true as well."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_48,"If you just want to check the source of this darkness, it shouldn't matter if I go instead of you."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_49,"Then, you can do what you want after I come back with the truth. How does that sound?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_50,"... Very well."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_51,"Oh, that's a surprise. I thought you'd refuse, at least a little bit."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_52,"Even if I refused, you probably would have done something to keep me here, anyway."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_53,"Am I wrong?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_54,"Well... You got me there."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_55,"Remember that this concerns Arlette's child..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_56,"I know. Just try to stay put until I come back."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_57,"Can you do that?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_58,"Yes."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_59,"Whew... Ah, speaking of Arlette."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_60,"These Ice Tigers often gather around her grave."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_61,"Gau seemed troubled and asked me to let you know about this problem."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_62,"Those pitiful beasts would dare desecrate the grave...? If you run into that barbarian..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_63,"tell him I'll personally take care of that problem soon..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_64,"Sure... I'll make sure to let him know on my way."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_65,"Is everything okay?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_66,"Everything is fine."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_67,"By the way... were you hurt at all?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_68,"I'm fine. I would much rather like to know if you've calmed down."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_69,"Don't worry about it. It's just..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_70,"Just?"
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_71,"No... Never mind."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_72,"But if my predictions are true..."
CH95_Sub_Windland_1_73,"That means..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_1,"!!"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_2,"Did you feel that, Aselica?"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_3,"I did. The pillar.. must have been destroyed..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_4,"What Lua's had been concerned about ended up happening."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_5,"The Master of the Holy Sword... he.."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_6,"I even warned him.. but he must have ignored it.."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_7,"What happened was probably inevitable."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_8,"Especially when she was standing by his side..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_9,"Maybe I should've gotten rid of her that time..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_10,"That wouldn't have been possible."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_11,"Huh?"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_12,"You do like humans, don't you?"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_13,"It was difficult enough for you to turn them down."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_14,"Hmph... the same applies to you, Aselica."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_15,"......"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_16,"Hmm? Is there anything else you wanted to say, Arch?"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_17,"There's been something on my mind."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_18,"The reason you and I came down here..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_19,"It's because we were ordered to look after the pillar and artifact, right?"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_20,"But why does she want us to look after the other artifact when we're close to the World Tree and Holy Sword...?"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_21,"......"
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_22,"Yes, I've been thinking that was strange too, but.."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_23,"Our mission is to follow Lua's orders."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_24,"We don't have the luxury to second guess what she's thinking. We can't have room for doubt."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_25,"That's true..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_26,"I apologize for wasting your time."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_27,"No, like I said, I was thinking the same thing."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_28,"Shall we go now? She's been waiting for us."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_29,"Of course."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_30,"The emergence of the second artifact in the Vespia Empire..."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_31,"It might have some connection with the World Tree that was destroyed."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_32,"I'd have to agree."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_33,"Let's move, Arch."
CH95_Sub_Dragia_1_34,"Following Lua's will...!"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_1,"I'm back, Epigael."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_2,"Welcome back, Dimael."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_3,"...What happened?"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_4,"It's the worst case scenario. It's even more serious than I had ever expected."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_5,"...The World Tree has been destroyed."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_6,"...!"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_7,"That black light was the demonic energy that burst out when the Dark Lord destroyed the World Tree."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_8,"The Dark Lord destroyed the World Tree!?"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_9,"Yes."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_10,"I saw it as soon as I entered King's Plains."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_11,"The World Tree was split down the middle."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_12,"And the black remains were slowly suffocating the ruins of the World Tree."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_13,"When I traced it back to its origin, I saw Orvel in ruins."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_14,"When I asked about what happened, I was told the Dark Lord appeared at the palace."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_15,"That's impossible. How could the Dark Lord appear in the middle of the human capital? Inside the palace, even...?"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_16,"Yes, I had the same question."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_17,"But I met up with one of the friends of the Orvel Princess who visited this place, and we found out it was all true."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_18,"The Dark Lord suddenly appeared inside the Royal Underground Labyrinth."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_19,"Though, I didn't hear all the details..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_20,"I just can't figure out what happened. What on earth is going on...?!"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_21,"What happened to the Warrior of the Holy Sword...? How did the Dark Lord return when he was there?"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_22,"..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_23,"Curses... I should have followed them..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_24,"Dimael..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_25,"...Ah."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_26,"Maybe. Just maybe, if I went with them..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_27,"Then, perhaps... things would have turned out differently..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_28,"I wasn't blaming you at all."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_29,"...It's okay. I'm just sad to see you blaming yourself over this."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_30,"...I'm sorry."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_31,"...It's fine. I'm really fine."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_32,"..."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_33,"If the Dark Lord has resurrected... the demon attacks will probably become stronger than ever before."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_34,"You're right."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_35,"That means we'll have to make a decision as well."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_36,"We have to decide whether we stay here like before to focus on our own safety,"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_37,"or cooperate with other forces to join this war."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_38,"My Queen."
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_39,"What is it?"
CH95_Sub_Arrovina_1_40,"A woman who claims to be the Princess of Elidora has requested an audience with you."
CH1_Sub_1_1_1,"God, these kids. I've told them a thousand times to make their beds after waking up."
CH1_Sub_1_1_2,"Looks like they got a little too excited with the field trip."
CH1_Sub_1_1_3,"Argh. I would've accompanied them if it weren't for that dispatch."
CH1_Sub_1_1_4,"Well then, now I should—"
CH1_Sub_1_1_5,"Grandpa? Yay! Look who's here!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_6,"Hmm? Mirianne, is that really you? It's been ages since I saw you last!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_7,"How've you been, dear? Are you here with Sonia?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_8,"Sonia's still at the guild."
CH1_Sub_1_1_9,"When we visited there due to a request, we met someone whom Sonia recognized."
CH1_Sub_1_1_10,"To me, this person was a stranger. I wonder who that person was."
CH1_Sub_1_1_11,"So you're saying... It's someone you do not know of, but Sonia does?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_12,"Yup."
CH1_Sub_1_1_13,"Hmm. How'd she look when she saw that person? Did she greet with a smile?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_14,"Um, I'm not sure. I think she looked uncomfortable."
CH1_Sub_1_1_15,"(Looked uncomfortable? Perhaps it's someone from the Tower of Sage?)"
CH1_Sub_1_1_16,"(Can't be. Sonia despises wizards... There's no way she would work with them.)"
CH1_Sub_1_1_17,"Grandpa? Maybe something bad happened to Sonia?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_18,"Don't worry. I'm sure she sent you first because the conversation was dragging a bit."
CH1_Sub_1_1_19,"If something is indeed a problem, I'm sure she'll tell you everything."
CH1_Sub_1_1_20,"But—"
CH1_Sub_1_1_21,"Sweetheart, don't you trust your grandpa?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_22,"O-of course I trust you! It's just that I'm worried about her."
CH1_Sub_1_1_23,"If you keep worrying like that, your face will get all wrinkly. Don't tell me you want to look old already!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_24,"Come on, grandpa. No way!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_25,"Ahahaha!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_26,"(Due to her unstable soul, she may have grown up to look like a 18-years-old girl...)"
CH1_Sub_1_1_27,"(But she's just a 12-year-old little kid.)"
CH1_Sub_1_1_28,"(There is no need to trigger the darkness within her by concerning her...)"
CH1_Sub_1_1_29,"Hmm? Come to think of it, I don't see Kasel, Clause, and Frey."
CH1_Sub_1_1_30,"Where are they?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_31,"Clause? From what I know, he joined the expedition team."
CH1_Sub_1_1_32,"Did something happen to Kasel and Frey?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_33,"I was actually looking for Kasel and Frey a moment ago."
CH1_Sub_1_1_34,"The soldiers said that Kasel vanished without leaving any word,"
CH1_Sub_1_1_35,"and Clause was sent somewhere really really far away."
CH1_Sub_1_1_36,"As for Frey, all I heard was that she's on a holiday."
CH1_Sub_1_1_37,"I see. According to the Great Priestess Iris, something odd has happened to the World Tree."
CH1_Sub_1_1_38,"So an expedition team was formed to look into the matter, and Clause joined them."
CH1_Sub_1_1_39,"But Frey and Kase... Wait. Could those two be...!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_40,"Grandpa? What's the matter?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_41,"Looks like these troublemakers left the town to look for Clause."
CH1_Sub_1_1_42,"Look... for Clause?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_43,"Yeah. It's been a month since he left, yet not a single piece of news has been heard. I'm sure they're worried sick about him."
CH1_Sub_1_1_44,"How reckless of them! They're only apprentices. Oh dear..."
CH1_Sub_1_1_45,"Are you saying Kasel and Frey are not in the castle?"
CH1_Sub_1_1_46,"I don't know the details, but since they disappeared without a word,"
CH1_Sub_1_1_47,"I should say that they left the castle."
CH1_Sub_1_1_48,"W-what should we do? If anything happens to them..."
CH1_Sub_1_1_49,"Though Kasel is unreliable from time to time,"
CH1_Sub_1_1_50,"Kasel and Frey are capable of taking care of themselves. Don't worry too much, my dear."
CH1_Sub_1_1_51,"But..."
CH1_Sub_1_1_52,"Why don't we visit Demia? She might have some info we need."
CH1_Sub_1_1_53,"Okay, grandpa!"
CH1_Sub_1_1_54,"(Kasel, Frey, Clause. Hope everyone's fine...!)"
CH1_Sub_1_2_1,"Ach! T-this bad. This rate, I—"
CH1_Sub_1_2_2,"Lakrak, this be end! No place to run! You die now!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_3,"Me did not expect this ambush. Ach, my mistake...!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_4,"But I not give up. Me have many things want do!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_5,"End now! Die, first say sorry to goblins you slay!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_6,"Eeeek! Someone help Lakrak!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_7,"Ach? What that sound?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_8,"Eek? Odd monster aim to us!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_9,"Ach? What that?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_10,"Eeeeek!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_11,"T-that thing coming toward us! It hits us, we die!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_12,"Tall monster dangerous! We run! Eeeeek!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_13,"I is sure. That be machine weapon. Never see such before."
CH1_Sub_1_2_14,"Where he get that... Ach? N-no. Don't go!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_15,"Wait! Y-you stop!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_16,"Can me have a look at that case? Please! Once is okay!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_17,"...Why you look me like that?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_18,"Move aside."
CH1_Sub_1_2_19,"Never! You no show me weapon, me will not move!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_20,"Me want make weapon! Please, show me!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_21,"...Is that a request, or an order?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_22,"I-it's.."
CH1_Sub_1_2_23,"W-wait! You wait!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_24,"(Ach, me no want to do this, but... me must!)"
CH1_Sub_1_2_25,"Boss, I begging! Please show generosity to little goblin!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_26,"Boss, may me see awesome case?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_27,"(How annoying.. but this goblin isn't displaying any hostility.)"
CH1_Sub_1_2_28,"(I must be end this conversation nice and fast, then make my way to the client.)"
CH1_Sub_1_2_29,"B-boss? So what you think?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_30,"Do you want to take a look at it?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_31,"O-o-ohhh! Can me really take a look at it?!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_32,"Be quick."
CH1_Sub_1_2_33,"Mmm. Can't understand looking at exterior of it. Need more.."
CH1_Sub_1_2_34,"Ach! Me know what me need."
CH1_Sub_1_2_35,"Boss, no blueprint or manual?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_36,"You are quite the demanding goblin."
CH1_Sub_1_2_37,"Please, boss! Me will have a quick look and return fast!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_38,"That weapon of yours... did you craft it by yourself?"
CH1_Sub_1_2_39,"That's right! This Lakrak MK-2! Made by me hands!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_40,"One should use a weapon that fits the wielder."
CH1_Sub_1_2_41,"It seems your weapon's modified to fit your small physique."
CH1_Sub_1_2_42,"Uh, yes. Me designed this weapon to make it fit perfect for me."
CH1_Sub_1_2_43,"You know the answer, then."
CH1_Sub_1_2_44,"...? W-wait!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_45,"Ach! He gone."
CH1_Sub_1_2_46,"What?! He no use kind words! Mean!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_47,"Rude! He only difficult words! I no like him! "
CH1_Sub_1_2_48,"I stupid for call him boss! I should only trust me!"
CH1_Sub_1_2_49,"I need leave first... Goblins again maybe."
CH1_Sub_1_2_50,"Ogria is good. Goblins no follow me there. Then..."
CH1_Sub_1_2_51,"I make best weapon! I do it!"
CH1_Sub_1_3_1,"Lady Maria."
CH1_Sub_1_3_2,"What about the kids?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_3,"I witnessed them entering the Elidora Forest."
CH1_Sub_1_3_4,"My lady, will it be ok? They are just mere humans."
CH1_Sub_1_3_5,"Though he now has the Holy Sword,"
CH1_Sub_1_3_6,"confronting them won't be easy unless the sword regains its full power."
CH1_Sub_1_3_7,"Don't worry about that. Those kids are just pawns for the plan."
CH1_Sub_1_3_8,"Though I must admit that filthy weapon took me by surprise..."
CH1_Sub_1_3_9,"Lady Maria...?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_10,"..."
CH1_Sub_1_3_11,"My lady, is something bothering you?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_12,"Nothing... Don't mind it."
CH1_Sub_1_3_13,"Anyhow, leaving that sword to those kids doesn't seem bad at all."
CH1_Sub_1_3_14,"Who knows? It might come in handy."
CH1_Sub_1_3_15,"I'm quite excited to see how they'll end up. They may become very useful."
CH1_Sub_1_3_16,"Lady Maria..."
CH1_Sub_1_3_17,"How's the other area?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_18,"You don't need to worry about Arrovina."
CH1_Sub_1_3_19,"'His' actions have been delaying Malduk's plan."
CH1_Sub_1_3_20,"Whatever the outcome is, it will do no harm to you."
CH1_Sub_1_3_21,"However, we're having some issues at the Galluah Plains..."
CH1_Sub_1_3_22,"Don't tell me she's still not found."
CH1_Sub_1_3_23,"Forgive me, my lady. I was too preoccupied to report this sooner."
CH1_Sub_1_3_24,"That damned woman... She always complicates matters for us."
CH1_Sub_1_3_25,"You do know that we are short on time, yes?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_26,"No matter how well things turn out in other areas, it is pointless unless the matters at the Galluah Plains are resolved."
CH1_Sub_1_3_27,"Keep that in mind."
CH1_Sub_1_3_28,"Yes, my lady."
CH1_Sub_1_3_29,"Where's Malduk again?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_30,"I heard he's currently in Ogria. He seems to be scheming something again."
CH1_Sub_1_3_31,"That Malduk... For a loathsome undead, he is quite troublesome."
CH1_Sub_1_3_32,"I've been finding Malduk as a competent entity for a long time."
CH1_Sub_1_3_33,"We should not underestimate him."
CH1_Sub_1_3_34,"How's the situation in Ogria?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_35,"It appears that the goblins of the King's Plains have moved to Ogria."
CH1_Sub_1_3_36,"Apparently, these goblins are now the underlings of the orcs there."
CH1_Sub_1_3_37,"Hmm, goblins."
CH1_Sub_1_3_38,"By any chance, are you planning to use those goblins to fight Malduk?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_39,"I doubt those pathetic goblins will be of any help."
CH1_Sub_1_3_40,"Who knows? Malduk will think they're worthless and let his guard down."
CH1_Sub_1_3_41,"What I require from them is a little distraction. I expect nothing more."
CH1_Sub_1_3_42,"If that is your wish, then I shall start prepar—"
CH1_Sub_1_3_43,"No, Morrah. You keep looking for Epis."
CH1_Sub_1_3_44,"We need her to resolve the matters in Galluah Plains."
CH1_Sub_1_3_45,"I'll be heading to Ogria. Once you're done with your job, join me."
CH1_Sub_1_3_46,"Yes, lady Maria."
CH1_Sub_1_3_47,"Interesting. I didn't expect to see that sword again."
CH1_Sub_1_3_48,"The Holy Sword, Lua, and him..."
CH1_Sub_1_3_49,"Hahahaha...!"
CH1_Sub_1_3_50,"The successor of the Holy Sword...?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_51,"A hero who will save the world just as he did in the past...?"
CH1_Sub_1_3_52,"Haha. Hahaha. Ahahahahaha!"
CH2_Sub_1_1,"Meanwhile, in the streets of Orvel..."
CH2_Sub_1_2,"Answer me, Clause!"
CH2_Sub_1_3,"And don't even think about lying! We already know what you've been up to!"
CH2_Sub_1_4,"(Ugh, how did it come to this?)"
CH2_Sub_1_5,"(I just wanted to say hi and treat them to dinner...)"
CH2_Sub_1_6,"Clause! Are you listening?!"
CH2_Sub_1_7,"S-Sonia, could you please calm down? And it's hard for me to say anything if you keep glaring at me like that!"
CH2_Sub_1_8,"Hmph!"
CH2_Sub_1_9,"(*Sigh* Just where and how did they hear about Kasel and Frey...?)"
CH2_Sub_1_10,"(Regardless, I shouldn't tell them anything... Existence of the Holy Sword must be kept as a secret, or Kasel may get into big trouble.)"
CH2_Sub_1_11,"(It's not that I don’t trust these girls... I just don't want more villains like that witch to chase Kasel.) "
CH2_Sub_1_12,"Kasel and Frey are in the Elidora Forest. Something came up, so they decided to go on an adventure."
CH2_Sub_1_13,"What is that something? And an adventure? What are you talking about?"
CH2_Sub_1_14,"I'm not sure. I've just returned, so I have no details—"
CH2_Sub_1_15,"You really are bad at lying, Clause."
CH2_Sub_1_16,"Kasel and Frey were crazily happy when they became a knight and a priest. Don't tell me you forgot how happy they were back then."
CH2_Sub_1_17,"They are very happy with their current status, yet an adventure came up out of nowhere?"
CH2_Sub_1_18,"And why do you think they left Orvel Castle? That's because they were worried about you!"
CH2_Sub_1_19,"Even I'm aware of it but you're not? None of your words make sense!"
CH2_Sub_1_20,"Um, we tried to visit Kasel and Frey not too long ago, but they were nowhere to be seen."
CH2_Sub_1_21,"So we asked grandpa about their whereabouts. That's when and where we heard about you."
CH2_Sub_1_22,"He thinks Kasel and Frey decided to leave the castle to find you because they didn't hear from you for a month."
CH2_Sub_1_23,"I wouldn't mind if they're okay,"
CH2_Sub_1_24,"but it's not like them to leave without telling anyone."
CH2_Sub_1_25,"I'm sorry, but I can't tell you much for now... One thing for sure is that they are both doing well."
CH2_Sub_1_26,"When I last saw them back at the World Tree, they had made good friends."
CH2_Sub_1_27,"With them, I'm sure Kasel and Frey will overcome any obstacles."
CH2_Sub_1_28,"But still..."
CH2_Sub_1_29,"Huh, friends? To them?"
CH2_Sub_1_30,"What are they like? Are they nice? Are they really trustworthy?"
CH2_Sub_1_31,"Come on, Kasel and Frey are not that silly."
CH2_Sub_1_32,"And I also think the new companions are nice ones. I'm sure they'll be of great help to Kasel and Frey."
CH2_Sub_1_33,"Hmm..."
CH2_Sub_1_34,"Anyways, aren't you two hungry? Let's go get some food. It's been a while since we ate something together."
CH2_Sub_1_35,"Tell me everything that you girls want. It's all on me!"
CH2_Sub_1_36,"Seriously? Anything and everything?"
CH2_Sub_1_37,"Of course! I got you!"
CH2_Sub_1_38,"Yay! Let's go Sonia! I'm gonna eat so much that my tummy—"
CH2_Sub_1_39,"Oh no! I almost forgot about it. We have something important to do today."
CH2_Sub_1_40,"Sorry Clause! I'd love to join you for dinner, but not today. We must leave now."
CH2_Sub_1_41,"Huh?"
CH2_Sub_1_42,"See you later! Let's go, Mirianne."
CH2_Sub_1_43,"Umm..."
CH2_Sub_1_44,"What is it? What's going on?"
CH2_Sub_1_45,"Something's fishy. I think we should check on Kasel and Frey with our own eyes."
CH2_Sub_1_46,"Huh? What are you—"
CH2_Sub_1_47,"Think about it. Has Clause ever kept secrets from us?"
CH2_Sub_1_48,"I might not know everything about Clause, but I know one thing for certain: he never makes secrets to us."
CH2_Sub_1_49,"That's true but..."
CH2_Sub_1_50,"I'm not saying I don't trust him... Something just doesn't feel right."
CH2_Sub_1_51,"From what I've heard, the knightly order has been keeping squires from leaving the castle due to frequent advents of the Demons lately."
CH2_Sub_1_52,"Kasel and Frey are mere apprentices, and yet an adventure without leaving any words? I don't understand any of it."
CH2_Sub_1_53,"Something's clearly going on... Perhaps they are involved in something far more serious than what we had thought."
CH2_Sub_1_54,"Okay... If that's what you really think, I also wanna go with you."
CH2_Sub_1_55,"Moreover, I also thought Clause was acting a bit weird..."
CH2_Sub_1_56,"Tee hee, thanks."
CH2_Sub_1_57,"Elidora Forest, was it? Okay then, let's go!"
CH2_Sub_1_58,"Okay!"
CH2_Sub_2_1,"(This place must be Elidora. A land covered with trees, the homeland of the elves...)"
CH2_Sub_2_2,"(Roi is here... hmm?)"
CH2_Sub_2_3,"Still alive, not dead."
CH2_Sub_2_4,"(They are elites of elites in our organization... Who could've done this?)"
CH2_Sub_2_5,"(Wait. This cut wound...!)"
CH2_Sub_2_6,"(Finally... I've got you, Roi!)"
CH2_Sub_2_7,"(But I'm also seeing traces of multiple others. Then he—)"
CH2_Sub_2_8,"No! Noo! You must listen to Rephy!"
CH2_Sub_2_9,"(Hmm?)"
CH2_Sub_2_10,"Please, you must listen to Rephy! Rephy is here to guide you all to the Starlight Bridge! Really!"
CH2_Sub_2_11,"(Won't hurt to check out...)"
CH2_Sub_2_12,"Ehhh, what should I do? No matter how bright Rephy shines the lantern, no one would respond..."
CH2_Sub_2_13,"Hmm? Who are you? Are you a friend of this masked person?"
CH2_Sub_2_14,"(I've never seen anything that looks like this one...)"
CH2_Sub_2_15,"Hey, did you not hear me? Are you a friend of this one?"
CH2_Sub_2_16,"(Not breathing...)"
CH2_Sub_2_17,"By the time Rephy got here, this person was already dead..."
CH2_Sub_2_18,"I was fortunate enough to heal all the others over there, but it's sad that I couldn't heal everyone."
CH2_Sub_2_19,"Heal...?"
CH2_Sub_2_20,"Yes. It is Rephy's main duty to guide a spirit, but it's also my task to aid the injured. "
CH2_Sub_2_21,"(Come to think of it, those guys at back weren't bleeding. That means...)"
CH2_Sub_2_22,"These people are not completely safe yet. Angry spirits are trying to harm your friends."
CH2_Sub_2_23,"I must put the spirits of these people to rest, and guide them to the Starlight Bridge."
CH2_Sub_2_24,"What does that mean?"
CH2_Sub_2_25,"I, Rephy, am a sage of the Tamian tribe, and also known as a Spiritual Guide. That's why I'm able to communicate with the spirits!"
CH2_Sub_2_26,"The spirits here seem very angry. What should Rephy do?"
CH2_Sub_2_27,"And these masked people, who are they? I've never felt a grudge this strong."
CH2_Sub_2_28,"A strong... grudge?"
CH2_Sub_2_29,"Yes... Could it be that these masked people made the spirits here suffer?"
CH2_Sub_2_30,"For instance, these masked people may have forcefully taken the lives of innocent people..."
CH2_Sub_2_31,"So? What's wrong with that?"
CH2_Sub_2_32,"What's wrong with that? Are you serious?! It is a great sin to take someone's life away."
CH2_Sub_2_33,"The Queen of Blue Star shall punish such humans!"
CH2_Sub_2_34,"There are people in the world who have no choice but to make such decisions..."
CH2_Sub_2_35,"Do not judge others like that."
CH2_Sub_2_36,"What? You... You are an idiot! A spirit that holds grudge follows its target until the very end!  "
CH2_Sub_2_37,"It brings all kinds of misfortunes to the person until he or she dies!"
CH2_Sub_2_38,"And finally, after that person dies..."
CH2_Sub_2_39,"The spirit will savagely bite off the dead one's spirit, and eventually turn into an evil spirit."
CH2_Sub_2_40,"You are nothing different from these people here. I'm seeing a lot of angry spirits around you."
CH2_Sub_2_41,"I'd say stop committing evil deeds! Do not make the spirits infuriated. You may not hear them, but Rephy can."
CH2_Sub_2_42,"Rephy can hear ear-piercing cries of the spirits that roam around you..."
CH2_Sub_2_43,"Speaking of which, a swarm of dark-touched spirits made an appearance in Elidora Forest recently."
CH2_Sub_2_44,"It's not safe to stay here. Take these people here with you and leave."
CH2_Sub_2_45,"..."
CH2_Sub_2_46,"W-wha? Hey, wait! Stop! I said take these people with you!"
CH2_Sub_2_47,"(Enraged spirits... are roaming around me? To devour me?)"
CH2_Sub_2_48,"(Maybe he's right. I've taken away countless lives.)"
CH2_Sub_2_49,"(It'd be disrespectful to ask them for forgiveness... I have no ground for a redemption.)"
CH2_Sub_2_50,"(But if I had another path or an option I could choose... Then my hands wouldn't have to be stained with blood...)"
CH2_Sub_2_51,"(Were you thinking the same, Roi? Are you seeking for that another path?)"
CH2_Sub_2_52,"(Then why... Why did you betray me, Roi...? Why? Why did you leave me?!)"
CH2_Sub_3_1,"Lorraine, may I have a word with you?"
CH2_Sub_3_2,"Judging by your tone, I assume you wish to chat in private."
CH2_Sub_3_3,"I would very much appreciate your cooperation."
CH2_Sub_3_4,"This place will do. Now pray tell with ease."
CH2_Sub_3_5,"I will cut to the chase."
CH2_Sub_3_6,"Previously, Naila and the harpies mentioned that Queen Balalaika has sided with the Demons."
CH2_Sub_3_7,"From what I've seen, however... Balalaika seemed completely brainwashed by the darkness."
CH2_Sub_3_8,"Hmm... Your reasoning?"
CH2_Sub_3_9,"Although Queen Balalaika has shown her madness against us,"
CH2_Sub_3_10,"there was no clear indication that she was in fact, corrupted by darkness."
CH2_Sub_3_11,"Balalaika was just like how she had always been. Arrogant, and true to her desire."
CH2_Sub_3_12,"Surely you know this, your highness."
CH2_Sub_3_13,"This is no time for subtlety!"
CH2_Sub_3_14,"You should know very well how serious this matter is!"
CH2_Sub_3_15,"My apologies for being rude... I could not keep my composure."
CH2_Sub_3_16,"I was just—"
CH2_Sub_3_17,"Your highness, you must be curious about my thoughts on this matter. The thoughts which I have been hiding from others."
CH2_Sub_3_18,"...As a Princess of the Elves, I must know."
CH2_Sub_3_19,"I am certain that your observation on Queen Balalaika... is mostly correct."
CH2_Sub_3_20,"That though, brings another question to the table: 'what power does this demon behind the curtain possess?'"
CH2_Sub_3_21,"Meaning...?"
CH2_Sub_3_22,"I'm afraid that even I do not know the identity of the culprit who corrupted the harpy queen."
CH2_Sub_3_23,"I believe that Queen Balalaika was brainwashed through special means..."
CH2_Sub_3_24,"The corruption of the queen's soul may have been achieved by amplifying inner desires to the extreme."
CH2_Sub_3_25,"As a result, all components of one's soul helplessly succumb to the corruption, which stemmed from negative energy built within."
CH2_Sub_3_26,"Impossible... That's ridiculous! No way anyone cou—"
CH2_Sub_3_27,"It'd be wise not to underestimate the extent of the power that Demons have."
CH2_Sub_3_28,"Demons are way more cunning and unpredictable than we can imagine."
CH2_Sub_3_29,"Especially, the power of the high-rank Demons far surpasses our imagination."
CH2_Sub_3_30,"For instance, there's one who could tear through a dimension with its raw strength."
CH2_Sub_3_31,"And, there's another one who can use hexes of any forms."
CH2_Sub_3_32,"And lastly, Epis, the one who helped out King Kyle in the past. That was the most unpredictable act of all."
CH2_Sub_3_33,"But...!"
CH2_Sub_3_34,"Your highness, you've fought side-by-side with the warrior of the Holy Sword, have you not?"
CH2_Sub_3_35,"Then you must have seen it already."
CH2_Sub_3_36,"The unknown dark energy emitted from the Holy Sword."
CH2_Sub_3_37,"Yes... I had never felt such energy that's so heavy and bizarre."
CH2_Sub_3_38,"As expected, you felt it... The energy, the power you felt is that of the Dark Lord."
CH2_Sub_3_39,"What? W-wait, what do you mean by—"
CH2_Sub_3_40,"100 years ago, Kyle undoubtedly succeeded in taking down the Dark Lord."
CH2_Sub_3_41,"However, during the fight, the Holy Sword was imbued with the evil energy the Dark Lord had."
CH2_Sub_3_42,"Although it is slumbering inside the Holy Sword, the moment our warrior falls to darkness,"
CH2_Sub_3_43,"the dark energy will not hesitate to emerge and show its true color."
CH2_Sub_3_44,"N-no way..."
CH2_Sub_3_45,"Unfortunately, it was impossible to remove the Dark Lord's energy from the Holy Sword."
CH2_Sub_3_46,"Hence, we chose to divide the power of the Holy Sword."
CH2_Sub_3_47,"Lorraine, what must I do...?"
CH2_Sub_3_48,"You are the princess of us elves, the colonnade that upholds Elidora."
CH2_Sub_3_49,"Saving the ones that have fallen to darkness, and finding the culprit behind this incident... that should be your role."
CH2_Sub_3_50,"But will that be enough? Even at this very moment, our warrior is—"
CH2_Sub_3_51,"Do not go astray, your highness. I understand your concern, but that is not the role you are destined for."
CH2_Sub_3_52,"B-but...!"
CH2_Sub_3_53,"Yes, the warrior is currently weak. He is unstable and young."
CH2_Sub_3_54,"However, just like King Kyle in the past, he has comrades whom he can trust and rely upon."
CH2_Sub_3_55,"I'm sure his comrades will support him well."
CH2_Sub_3_56,"..."
CH2_Sub_3_57,"(Even though I said so myself, I also pity the cruel destiny the warrior has...)"
CH2_Sub_3_58,"(This must be Lua's will, but is it right to blindly follow?)"
CH2_Sub_3_59,"(Arlette... Your son now carries a titanic burden on his shoulders. What should we do for him...?)"
