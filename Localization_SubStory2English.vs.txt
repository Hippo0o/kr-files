Sub1_Prisila_1_1_1,"Golden eyes filled with anxiety."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_2,"Will I die here?"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_3,"That's not something a child under ten should be asking."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_4,"I reflexively bit my lips"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_5,"staring at the anxious little girl."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_6,"This girl with those small hands had the fate to change all this."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_7,"I felt everything was futile, and yet pitied her."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_8,"Don't worry. Everything will be fine."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_9,"That's the way it always turns out."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_10,"I used to say it to everyone who trusted and followed me,"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_11,"like an old habit."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_12,"Don't worry, everything will be fine."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_13,"The little girl blankly stared at her as she got off the carriage."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_14,"It was raining hard outside."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_15,"I'm Priscilla, my lady, and I'll be serving you from now on."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_16,"The woman looked back at the girl and spoke with an emotionless face."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_17,"The words were formal and stiff, but the voice that carried them sounded trustworthy and reliable."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_18,"Th-thank you!"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_19,"The little girl nodded,"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_20,"and the woman left the carriage without looking back again."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_21,"Not much later, the air around the carriage suddenly began to change."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_22,"Clang!"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_23,"The sharp sounds of metal shook the carriage."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_24,"The screams were buried by the sound of the rain."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_25,"Time passed and the rain eased off, eventually."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_26,"*Click*"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_27,"The woman got in the carriage soaking wet."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_28,"The little girl burst into tears."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_29,"Thank you. Thank you..."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_30,"The woman didn't know what to do"
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_31,"as the girl started wailing out of relief."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_32,"She silently reached her arms out and hugged the little girl."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_33,"The girl was small, and so was the sound of her crying."
Sub1_Prisila_1_1_34,"It's okay. I'll always be here by your side."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_1,"Guh..."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_2,"The evil creature let out an ear-scratching shriek"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_3,"as its sticky and disgusting blood splashed above."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_4,"The crimson blood stained the beautiful white luster on the blade of her halberd."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_5,"What type of soldiers do you think are needed in the army?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_6,"Those who do not think for themselves."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_7,"Those who do not consider themselves as individuals."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_8,"So, what type of soldier do you think you are?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_9,"Someone who has her own thoughts."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_10,"Someone who has beliefs."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_11,"Someone who considers herself an individual with an opinion."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_12,"And someone who will put everyone in danger."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_13,"Lieutenant Priscilla, that's who I see in you."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_14,"It's your choice."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_15,"Choose which of the two will tread this thorny path."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_16,"Is it yourself or all the ones that follow you?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_17,"Bastards..."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_18,"Oh. Here she comes."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_19,"Commander, here!"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_20,"The soldiers waved their hands at Priscilla from afar."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_21,"Some of them were lying down on the floor exhausted or"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_22,"looking after their injured comrades."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_23,"Others dug resting places for those who faced their end."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_24,"Whose grave is it?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_25,"It's Erox's."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_26,"Crows feed on corpses unless they are buried well underground."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_27,"There were dozens of sites like this, the ones that belong to the soldiers"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_28,"whose remains I had promised to bring back to their home."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_29,"It was not a rare occurrence."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_30,"My troop started with about 80 soldiers,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_31,"but the endless battles decreased their numbers"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_32,"without any reinforcements ever coming to help."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_33,"We were sent to more dangerous places,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_34,"where we had to put our lives on the line."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_35,"We were supposed to fight battles of conquest,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_36,"but what we were fighting were battles for survival."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_37,"Is everyone okay?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_38,"Of course. Who do you think you're talking to?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_39,"We're warriors who've found hundreds of battles."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_40,"It was a cheerful reply"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_41,"to which I could not say anything back,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_42,"so I just stared at them."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_43,"The soldier who just answered"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_44,"was also injured, and had bandages around his head."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_45,"It looks like your ego is growing faster than your skills."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_46,"Ha ha. Come on."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_47,"The soldiers scratched their heads and laughed sheepishly,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_48,"but it made my heart ache for them."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_49,"This place is worse than the any we've fought in before."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_50,"I'm afraid those things are just going to erupt out of everywhere."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_51,"You know, like that time 100 years ago..."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_52,"Hey! Don't jinx it!"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_53,"Baaaaam!"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_54,"A single, long blare of a horn,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_55,"then another two at a short interval, followed by the long last one."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_56,"It meant that the enemy had appeared. A lot of them."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_57,"Ah, come on! You jinxed it!"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_58,"You're blaming me for this?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_59,"It was unexpected."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_60,"The prior investigation"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_61,"didn't find anything that would suggest something like this happening."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_62,"However,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_63,"I could guess what was going on."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_64,"It was intentional."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_65,"It was deliberate..."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_66,"I could hear the voice inside my head."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_67,"The arrogant voice of a man looking down on me."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_68,"Well, there's nothing wrong with your soldiers, as they're just following your orders."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_69,"Do not expect any support from now on."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_70,"We don't have the time and energy to spare for a traitor."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_71,"He had sent us in hopes of killing us all from the beginning..."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_72,"Damn, are these things ever going to stop coming...?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_73,"The soldiers beat the dust off their pants as they stood up,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_74,"but their hands were slightly shaking."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_75,"Priscilla stood in front of them,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_76,"and began to speak in a soft voice."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_77,"Thank you for all you've done."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_78,"What are you saying?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_79,"You have to pull yourself together."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_80,"Isn't she dizzy because of the blood covering her?"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_81,"I know, I don't like the blood of those Demons, either."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_82,"I think I have a fever, too."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_83,"Hey, stop fooling around and go get some water."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_84,"It looks like there are a lot of them this time."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_85,"They're no trouble, as long as you don't do anything stupid."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_86,"Ha ha. Look whose ego has grown faster than their skills!"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_87,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_88,"Commander, here, some water."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_89,"Thank you."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_90,"The blood washes off as Priscilla poured water over her head."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_91,"The water runs through her hair and down her neck,"
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_92,"revealing her white skin."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_93,"Wow..."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_94,"Priscilla in appearance was a goddess reincarnated on the battlefield."
Sub1_Prisila_2_1_95,"Don't worry. Everything will be fine."
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_1,"!?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_2,"Allies?!"
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_3,"Move! They are not..."
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_4,"Grrrr."
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_5,"Gugh!"
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_6,"Wh-what's this!?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_7,"Kwah!"
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_8,"Clang!"
Sub1_Prisila_3_1_9,"Kuh!"
Sub1_Prisila_3_2_1,"A survivor?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_2_2,"Move, you're in the way."
Sub1_Prisila_3_2_3,"!?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_2_4,"Move, you're in the way."
Sub1_Prisila_3_2_5,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_1,"She buried them"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_2,"so that they wouldn't be pecked by the crows."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_3,"Promising to come back someday,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_4,"Priscilla buried them all."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_5,"Were they your men?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_6,"Well, it was a stupid question after all."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_7,"It's Project Evil Knights."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_8,"...I know."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_9,"...You know?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_10,"I see. So, they did this to silence you."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_11,"(A giant halberd... So this is Orvelia's Storm. Such a young woman...)"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_12,"I won't ask how you know."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_13,"But share any information you have."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_14,"Why should I?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_15,"These things will continue to happen."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_16,"First, in vast battlefields where anyone could die,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_17,"then in small battles,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_18,"and then anywhere. Their only point is to take away life."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_19,"And in the end, you'll have to raise your blade towards those you're sworn to protect."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_20,"I'm sure you understand that by now."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_21,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_22,"...Who are you?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_23,"Nothing good will come from you knowing. So don't ask."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_24,"I've never seen a weapon like that, not once throughout my service in the army."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_25,"An eccentric friend made it as an experiment."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_26,"And that outfit... Are you from the empire?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_27,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_28,"Give up on your revenge. They won't even be shaken by a single person."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_29,"Aren't you alone, too?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_30,"Humans with nothing to lose are different..."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_31,"What I cared about are all lost here as well."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_32,"No, you and I are different in nature. You are one of those people whose mission is to protect."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_33,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_34,"You know you can't expect the army to do something here, do you?"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_35,"I'm the last one to expect something from those bastards."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_36,"Heh. Good."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_37,"This place has already become their lab."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_38,"I'll show you the way to get out. Take your men and leave this place."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_39,"But you'll have to tell me what you know about the Evil Knights beforehand."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_40,"I told him everything,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_41,"all the things I heard and witnessed,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_42,"how I exposed the injustice prevailing in the military,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_43,"and how me and my men were cornered into a deadly situation."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_44,"The man silently listened to my story."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_45,"And after giving a simple answer to my last question,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_46,"he disappeared back into the battlefield."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_47,"I will get my revenge,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_48,"and those who took my world will pay the price."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_49,"The court finds the defendant guilty of abusing her authority"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_50,"under Clause 1, Section 23 of Military Criminal Law for having forced her soldiers into battle."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_51,"The court also finds the defendant guilty of sedition"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_52,"under Clause 2, Section 3 in National Security Article of Military Criminal Law"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_53,"for having conspired with enemy forces for the sake of sowing distrust within the army."
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_54,"Lieutenant Priscilla, the only due punishment for you should be death,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_55,"but in recognition of all the victories you have brought to the country,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_56,"and the fact that you retired your title in regret,"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_57,"and, most importantly, since King Veroglance the Second of Orvelia"
Sub1_Prisila_3_3_58,"has granted his mercy upon you, you will be stripped of your authority and banished from the country."
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_1,"Years have passed since King Kyle's sacrifice and the Holy Sword of Goddess Lua"
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_2,"brought victory to humans over the Demons,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_3,"but the country was going crazier by the day."
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_4,"Crazy to the extent that the whole country was after the life of a little girl."
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_5,"That girl is our family's only hope."
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_6,"That girl must reach the Tower of Wizards for us and you to survive."
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_7,"Yes, power is always the problem."
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_8,"Tap-tap-tap!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_9,"Claaang!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_10,"Clang!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_1_11,"Clang!!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_1,"Kwaaaah!!!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_2,"The enemy seems to have grown in power since the last encounter."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_3,"I would normally have been able to handle the situation with ease,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_4,"but it was hard for me to even hold onto the halberd."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_5,"!?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_6,"Kuh... Kuh... Kwahhh!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_7,"Priscilla Le Aviutz?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_8,"And... Hmm... a berserk warrior?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_9,"Kuh..."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_10,"The berserk warrior cried in front of the man,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_11,"but didn't do anything else."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_12,"Well, he wasn't able to."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_13,"Overwhelming power?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_14,"A fear strong enough to make one's legs shake?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_15,"It wasn't something like that."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_16,"It was as if his eyes were penetrating through the outer shell,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_17,"thoroughly observing what was supposed to remain unseen."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_18,"It was the kind of gaze that made one feel completely naked and helpless."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_19,"Alright. You have no business with me. Begone."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_20,"K-Kwah?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_21,"I'm just saying, I didn't make a hole in the ground."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_22,"I just moved him away so that we won't be interrupted."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_23,"...Who are you?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_24,"Just an ordinary wizard who likes traveling."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_25,"I'm sorry, but you are the least ordinary wizard I've seen."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_26,"Well, in case you feel hostile,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_27,"I'm not here to put you to sleep."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_28,"Then what brings you here?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_29,"I received a request and came to take care of it."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_30,"He then took out a small envelope."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_31,"I think we should take care of the folks over there before we start talking."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_32,"Look at that hideous creature they sent."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_33,"Is it possible for a human to have this much power...?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_34,"I know, I can be very charming."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_35,"Now, let's get back to the point."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_36,"The high-quality paper envelope"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_37,"and the fancy red seal stamped on it meant it was a message from a noble."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_38,"It was strange, since I didn't know any noblemen"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_39,"who would write a letter to me."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_40,"..."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_41,"Priscilla's eyebrows raised as she read the message."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_42,"She stared directly at the man."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_43,"What is this...?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_44,"I know, but it's serious."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_45,"Not going to happen."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_46,"Tsk, I thought you would."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_47,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_48,"I know it sounds ridiculous."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_49,"Asking a former military officer of Orvelia, one of the youngest recognized by the brains of the army, to work as a maid"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_50,"pretty much sounds like a bad joke. Even though it's the renowned Daphnel family of Orvelia that's asking..."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_51,"I would've been speechless, too."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_52,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_53,"Well, as you can guess,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_54,"maid is just a title you need in order to be at the closest to the one you must protect."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_55,"You will be a barrier to the most important individual in Project Evil Knights, the source of all your trouble."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_56,"Also, If you become part of the Daphnel family, it will be much harder for them to get rid of you."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_57,"Nonsense."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_58,"...Alright. I'll tell my client that you refused."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_59,"The man took the letter from Priscilla, burned it, and turned around."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_60,"Then, go on and start your days dealing with those after your life."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_61,"Priscilla. How long has it been since you left the army?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_62,"About a month? Was there ever a single night when you actually enjoyed peace?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_63,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_64,"13 years old."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_65,"…?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_66,"The beloved daughter of the Daphnel family..."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_67,"If this girl falls into their hands, the near-infinite mana inside her will be drained to the limit"
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_68,"until she withers away."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_69,"A noble but sad fate..."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_70,"A brief moment of inattention would lead to the life of a little girl being consumed as material for experiments."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_71,"There's no time."
Sub1_Prisila_4_2_72,"They started moving already."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_1,"A breeze blows to carry the aroma of the hot coffee into the air."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_2,"The sun is hot, my lady."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_3,"An expensive-looking parasol block the sun."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_4,"I won't die from this much sun."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_5,"A little lady, with blonde hair tied into a bun,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_6,"looked at her maid as the warm sun was blocked from her view."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_7,"A lady does not face the Sun like that."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_8,"Tsk. Pedant."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_9,"A lady does not use such words."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_10,"Humph!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_11,"She snorted,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_12,"but she looked like a spoiled, younger sister showing her frustration at her elder sister."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_13,"Priscilla smiled quietly and looked at the little girl."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_14,"My lady."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_15,"Hmm?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_16,"I'm very happy right now. I want to be by your side for as long as I can."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_17,"Of course! You will be with me forever, Priscilla!!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_18,"A lady does not speak so loudly."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_19,"Come on!"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_20,"Priscilla's smile grew wider as she listened to the girl complaining."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_21,"As she gazed at the red sun and the blue sky,"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_22,"she recalled the last moment she saw the man and his odd eye."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_23,"I'll ask one thing. Why me?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_24,"Because your courage to sacrifice everything to defend justice was considered trustworthy."
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_25,"By whom?"
Sub1_Prisila_4_3_26,"Well, ha ha..."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_1,"You can come out now."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_2,"I did not want to interrupt you during such an important conversation."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_3,"You regain your true form at the full moon."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_4,"Just for a day."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_5,"I'll be able to regain my true power in a few years."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_6,"So, you're here. Does it mean that you left the orphanage of the Barbarians,"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_7,"or is it because of the two sisters of the Shadow Hilt family?"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_8,"It seems you really know everything that goes around in the world."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_9,"Well, I'm very curious."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_10,"Well, you can say I am here for both reasons. I did not think I would see you here, though."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_11,"You must know why I'm here, right?"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_12,"What a peculiar man."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_13,"Even I cannot figure out who you are."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_14,"You are not an Angel, nor a Demon... You look like a human, but there is something off about you."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_15,"Well, I hope that does not make you uncomfortable."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_16,"Ha ha. I cannot even tell how old you are."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_17,"I guess you just saw what happened."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_18,"Yes."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_19,"The creature that was created by the wisdom of cursed humans and the blood of your kind..."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_20,"Project Evil Knights."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_21,"Some of their plans violate the laws of nature."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_22,"Human wisdom is a treasure, but it's also a curse."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_23,"It was the wisdom of humans, motivated by greed, that opened the gate to the world of Demons 100 years ago."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_24,"It was also humans that exploited the power of Demons, the predators, to create those gruesome beings."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_25,"Such humans are not supposed to exist, living against the flow of time."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_26,"No one can tell how many times the disasters of the past will repeat themselves."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_27,"Aren't they already playing god by trying to create life?"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_28,"Didn't you say you were just an observer 100 years ago?"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_29,"I still am. I never deal with any trouble myself."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_30,"What I'm doing now is merely making a requested delivery."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_31,"I'm just a messenger in this world."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_32,"Responding to the ones in need of my service is also following the order of the world."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_33,"The girl that Priscilla Le Aviutz should protect plays a crucial role in Project Evil Knights"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_34,"with the enormous amount of mana flowing inside her."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_35,"The mass production of Evil Knights is impossible without her in their hands,"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_36,"which means it will be harder for them to break the balance of this world."
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_37,"Is keeping the balance what you truly aspire?"
Sub1_Prisila_5_1_38,"No. What I aspire is letting nature takes its course. I believe that's precisely what I'm doing."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_1,"You should not respond to a letter that looks so suspicious."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_2,"You didn't have to come, my lady. I am the one they wanted."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_3,"Your business is my business, Priscilla."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_4,"If it's from 4 years ago, it's related to me as well."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_5,"Alright. But if something happens, stay behind me."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_6,"So, it's really a trap."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_7,"But that mark looked real."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_8,"Priscilla. Doesn't this remind you of old times?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_9,"Everything will be fine."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_10,"Ha ha..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_11,"Yes. Everything will be fine."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_12,"Stop!"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_13,"How dare you assault a little girl"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_14,"and her slim ma...?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_15,"Hey, you cannot even finish your sentence?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_16,"As a knight, I won't let this go!"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_17,"…"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_18,"Come!"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_19,"Phew. This was a long journey."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_20,"It looks like we shouldn't have intruded."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_21,"No, you really helped us."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_22,"That halberd..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_23,"Ha ha! It's our sworn duty as knights."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_24,"You stupi... They didn't need you at all!"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_25,"How could I just ignore such a horrible scene?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_26,"I'm sorry I haven't introduced myself. I am..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_27,"Head of the Guardian Knights, Demia."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_28,"And Guardian Knight, Clause."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_29,"You know us?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_30,"She's the one who was once called the Halberd of Storm in the Orvelia army."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_31,"The halberd of Storm... Lieutenant Priscilla...? But she was accused of rebel..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_32,"It was a false accusation."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_33,"!?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_34,"Priscilla Le Aviutz..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_35,"Four years ago, I convinced my father to reduce her sentence,"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_36,"before they blinded his eyes."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_37,"She is a true patriot who firmly believes in justice."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_38,"Just as you are, Clause."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_39,"Princess..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_40,"It has been a while."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_41,"Your Highness, this one is honored to stand before the Faith of Silver, the mother to our people."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_42,"Aisha of the Daphnel family is honored to be graced by the presence of the master of Orvelia, your Highness."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_43,"Faith..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_44,"Master..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_45,"Absurd..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_46,"It's because of you and our people"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_47,"that the Orvel royal family exists..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_48,"Please raise your heads."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_49,"We have a lot to talk about."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_50,"It looks like the letter your Highness sent was substituted."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_51,"The time and location are all changed."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_52,"The seal stamped on the letter is almost identical with the real one."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_53,"It could easily fool just about anyone."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_54,"If we hadn't arrived here quickly as your Highness said..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_55,"The berserk warrior that was after your Highness..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_56,"was completely different from the ones that came before it."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_57,"...Berserk warrior?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_58,"We were also attacked."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_59,"If it had not been for Clause and Demia... Horrible things could have happened."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_60,"Once we are done talking, we will go find that man."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_61,"He still looked unstable."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_62,"Why did they take the trouble to deal with us separately?"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_63,"If I had been killed on the way according their plan, it would have been much easier for them"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_64,"to frame the Daphnel family and get rid of us all."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_65,"That means..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_66,"We face a common enemy."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_67,"We have a pretty good idea who were the ones that came after your Highness,"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_68,"but we need proof that links them to these madness."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_69,"The current prime minister of Orvelia, El Moriham..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_70,"The man who is gathering nobles to control my father, King Veroglance the Second..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_71,"The ambitious schemer who wanted to have you, the daughter of the Daphnel family, and your potential in his hands 4 years ago."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_72,"The Dark Legion of the Empire must also be related to this."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_73,"I knew that El Moriham has been meeting with the empire in secret,"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_74,"and I came to talk to you about the ones in the empire conspiring with him."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_75,"There's someone we must meet as well. He might be the true successor to the throne in Orvelia."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_100,"Erox..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_101,"Still... We managed to find his body."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_102,"Alright..."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_103,"Hahahaha!"
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_104,"A haircut will make you a bit more inconspicuous and hide you from prying eyes."
Sub1_Prisila_6_1_105,"After defeating them."
