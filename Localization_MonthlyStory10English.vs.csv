E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_01,That wave has been taken care of.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_02,"I’m finished here too. *Sigh...* The monsters may have lessened in number, but this really never ends..."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_03,And it will continue as the Demons keep on expanding their territory... This must be hard on you.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_04,"I'm okay. It is my duty to look after this desert, after all."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_05,"Anyway, I think this should be enough for today. Why don’t you head back now?"
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_06,"It is your birthday today, Laudia."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_07,"It’s alright. Just like you, I also share this duty."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_08,But-
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_09,I’m really okay. I was heading somewhere anyway.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_10,Heading somewhere??
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_11,"Well, a place I frequented ever since I was a kid... Do you want to come along?"
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_12,"It must be a special place. Yes, I would like to come along, if you don’t mind."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_13,I didn't know a place like this existed...
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_14,It's very well maintained. Is this a place for ritual?
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_15,"Nothing like that, but yes, I’ve been maintaining this place regularly."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_16,"This is sort of like a secret base I used when I was a kid. Oh boy, this is going to be a long story."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_17,Please do tell. I’m curious.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_18,"Well, so I heard this when I was really young..."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_19,"You’ve heard of it, right? The legend of the God Dragon who sleeps in the Shrine of Flow."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_20,Yes. I heard the story a lot during my bedtime when I was young.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_21,"I was young back then, so I didn't realize at all that it was a story of something that had actually happened."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_22,I just admired the God Dragon in the story because she is someone beautiful who blesses the desert with rain.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_23,"I thought that if the God Dragon ever wakes up, she will need a place to stay..."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_24,"Thinking back to it now, it’s really absurd."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_25,"Well... You were just a kid back then. Besides, Laias herself might actually think of this story as something pleasantly funny."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_26,"Thank you. So anyway, my search for a cool place led me here."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_27,‘I will play with the God Dragon here when she wakes up!’ I told myself that as I started cleaning this place.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_28,It was not until I got a bit older when I realized.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_29,Realize what?
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_30,That this place is too small for the God Dragon to stay.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_31,Ahaha. True.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_32,"Still, it's nice to see well-organized flowers and the clean floor."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_33,That's why I come to take care of this place whenever I have the time.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_34,I see... So do you come here on every birthday?
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_35,"Hmm? No, not really. This place just came to my mind because I had to speak to Laias quite often these days."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_36,"Since today is my birthday, I had some time to spare... So I wanted to spend that time visiting this place."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_37,"Ah, looks like I’ve come to the right place."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_38,La-Laias?! How did you-
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_39,"I’ve come to talk with you, Laudia."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_40,Then I shall go out and give you both some privacy. Have a pleasant conversation.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_41,So there’s a place like this in Aegina... Have you been maintaining this place by yourself?
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_42,"Yes, I maintain this place whenever I have time."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_43,The energy inside here is clean and pure... I can see that you gave so much effort to maintain this place over a long time.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_44,What a beautiful place. Do you mind if I visit here from time to time?
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_45,Of course. You may come whenever you wish.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_46,"Thank you, now about the reason why I came to see you..."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_47,"Please go ahead, I’m listening."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_48,"Happy birthday, Laudia. May the blessing of the flow be with you."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_49,"And although this may sound a bit sudden,"
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_50,you have done a great job fighting off the Demons.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_51,"Thanks to your effort, the people of the desert smile once again."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_52,"As the keeper of the desert, I thank you."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_53,I-I’m flattered... Thank you.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_54,I apologize for interrupting your rest. I hope the rest of your day will be pleasant and good.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_55,"You don’t have to apologize... You've visited this place and congratulated my birthday personally, after all..."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_56,Might I ask what you two talked about?
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_57,"Laias actually complimented me, saying that this place is beautiful... She wants to visit here from time to time."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_58,"...As a kid, I never imagined that I will one day get complimented by the God Dragon Laias herself."
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_59,It still feels like a dream...
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_60,So Laias will visit this place from time to time... Looks like your childhood dream has come true.
E_C19_Oct_Laudia01_61,You're right... It’s good that I never gave up and kept trying.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_01,"Happy birthday, Clause!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_02,"Happy birthday to you, Clause!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_03,"We made this for you. Pretty, right?"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_04,"Tee hee, Kasel spelled the name wrong."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_05,"Oh, come on, Frey! You promised you won’t bring that up!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_06,Haha! Both of these are so nice!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_07,Thank you so much! You two really are the best!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_08,"Back then, we were always the first to congratulate his birthday..."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_09,I know right...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_10,"Happy birthday, Clause!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_11,You are the pride of Orvel! Happy birthday!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_12,"Haha, thank you always!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_13,I will always try my best to meet your expectations.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_14,"Oh Clause, you don’t have to be so serious on your birthday too!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_15,But I guess that’s what makes you so likable! Congratulations!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_16,Maybe we can go in now?
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_17,"Yeah, I think this is the right time. Let’s-"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_18,Captain?! Is something the matter?
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_19,"No, I’ve come to see you. I see that you are surrounded by friends as usual."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_20,This is Her Highness' present and her handwritten letter to you.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_21,"Happy birthday, Clause."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_22,Happy birthday indeed!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_23,I’ve prepared a wooden sculpture of you. Please take it.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_24,"Haha, thanks Loman!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_25,"Also, thank you so much for this, captain. I shall visit Her Highness and thank her personally later."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_26,Please do so. Her Highness will be pleased.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_27,And...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_28,I would like to give you the title of the commander of knights today...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_29,"Oh, hahaha! Sorry, captain! I will have to refuse that."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_30,"I wish to help people more in my current position. I thank you for the offer, though."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_31,I believe that it is my duty right now.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_32,Failed... Again...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_33,The captain was faster this time...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_34,Clause is too popular.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_35,...Let's wait just a bit more.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_36,Yeah. We still have plenty of time.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_37,Clause looks like he’s having a lot of fun.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_38,"When we were young, it was just the three of us at birthday parties..."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_39,Are you feeling left out?
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_40,"Haha, you can tell?"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_41,It’s alright though. Clause is my brother.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_42,Although it is sad that we don't get to spend time together as much as we used to.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_43,Yeah...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_44,Hahaha... This year’s birthday was a blast too.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_45,"Huh, I don’t think I saw Kasel and Frey... Maybe they are busy?"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_46,"Well, Kasel just became an apprentice knight..."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_47,and Frey must be busy learning all the stuff too.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_48,They’ve all grown up after all.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_49,I remember that time when they gave me this... They were just little kids.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_50,"Hm? Oh, Clause!"
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_51,Why are you alone? Where’s Kasel and Frey?
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_52,They were out looking for you!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_53,What?
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_54,I thought they would be with you by now. Perhaps you missed each other?
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_55,Go look for them! They are probably still waiting for you.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_56,Darn it...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_57,Clause!\nClause!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_58,Hey!! Have you both been waiting for me all this time?!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_59,"Haha, of course! It's your birthday, after all. We thought we would see you if we wait here."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_60,"Sorry, we are a bit late... but you will forgive us, right? Tee hee."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_61,Kasel... Frey...
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_62,Of course. My birthday is incomplete without you guys.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_63,"Haha, don't mention it."
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_64,Happy birthday!
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_65,...My birthday is incomplete without you guys.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_66,Just hang in there.
E_C19_Oct_Clause01_67,I’m coming for you both.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_01,"Finally, the day has arrived."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_02,It's knucklehead’s birthday!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_03,"I’ve planned this over carefully twice already, fufufufu..."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_04,2 Days Ago
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_05,"Great, that knucklehead’s birthday is coming soon... What a nuisance."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_06,But I can’t just ignore it since he already gave me a gift before. I’m a fair dragon after all!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_07,"Oh, Laias!"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_08,Hmm? What is it?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_09,"Laias, for knuc- I mean, Neraxis's birthday, what are you going to give him?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_10,"Me? Well, since Neraxis wants to get stronger quickly..."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_11,I’m probably going to give him something helpful in battle.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_12,Hm...
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_13,You haven’t decided yet? Want some help?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_14,I-it’s alright! I can pick myself!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_15,"Fair enough, but make sure to tell me if you change your mind, okay?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_16,Ugh... Laias is too kind and gentle. Talking to her doesn't help.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_17,"Hmm, I mean just an ordinary present is fine too,"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_18,"but if I give him something really good, that’s actually going to make me feel strangely uncomfortable..."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_19,Oh right! I can give him that!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_20,1 Day Ago
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_21,Laudia.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_22,"Oh, hello Lilia. What brings you here?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_23,I have something to ask you.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_24,Sure! I will gladly answer you as best as I can.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_25,"Hey um, do you know any cool-looking but useless items?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_26,Cool-looking but useless?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_27,Oh! This must be about the gift for Neraxis. Cool-looking but useless...
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_28,"...Well, that statue you received from the God King as a birthday gift fits that criteria..."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_29,"It should look convincing or fancy enough,"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_30,but useless to the recipient of the gift.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_31,Fancy but useless...
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_32,Aha! Thanks! That helped!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_33,And... Today.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_34,.......
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_35,What the? Why is he making that face on the morning of his birthday?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_36,Maybe he's thinking about his previous family? Then maybe I should give him the present lat-
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_37,"Actually, nooo! Laias must not be the first one he sees!"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_38,Hey knucklehead! Happy birthday!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_39,Argh!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_40,"What the hell, moron?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_41,That's not a nice thing to say to someone who came to congratulate your birthday!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_42,Just shut up and take this! Happy birthday!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_43,?!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_44,Um... Okay... Th-thanks...
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_45,Hey.
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_46,What?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_47,What the hell is this?!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_48,Did your head literally become a knuckle? You can't even recognize what that is?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_49,"No, of course I know what it is! I’m not asking that!"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_50,"Of all things, why a chick decoration?!"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_51,What do you mean why? Because it’s cute! It's also a limited-edition!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_52,"Good morning, Neraxis. Happy birthday!"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_53,"Oh my... Did you really buy that yourself, Lilia?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_54,Of course! I’m not a kid anymore! I can find and buy something like that easily!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_55,"Wow, Lilia... You've really grown a lot... Where did you buy it from?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_56,Well there’s this antique shop in front of Orvel Castle-
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_57,.......
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_58,...?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_59,"Hey, ki- I mean, Lilia, this thing is making a strange noise."
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_60,Wh-what? N-no way! It must be your imagination!
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_61,"La-Laias! Let’s go make breakfast. We were going to make something delicious, right?"
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_62,That’s odd... What is she scheming now?
E_C19_Oct_Neraxis01_63,HEEEYY!!! YOU LITTLE!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???!!!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_1,Kasel?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_2,Kasel!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_3,"Oh, Frey."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_4,What were you thinking about?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_5,I’ve been calling you for a while. I was worried because you didn't respond.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_6,Haha... Just... some random things.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_7,Maybe it's because we are near the end of our journey...But I was just remembering a few things from our trip.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_8,...Sad memories?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_9,"Haha, not really."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_10,"Like... when we first met Cleo and Roi,"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_11,or that day when we saved Naila and Selene...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_12,Those kinds of things.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_13,I see…
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_14,"Come to think of it, we really went through a lot. We also met a lot of people..."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_15,"And you know what, there was your birthday as well."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_16,"Oh right, my birthday... Hahaha."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_17,"That took place a short while after we met Cleo and Roi, right?"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_18,"Yep, back then..."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_19,The Day of Kasel’s Birthday.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_20,Are you sure I can just give you anything? You can tell me what you want as a gift.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_21,"Anything is fine, really. What’s important is that you cared."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_22,But-
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_23,"Also, we have something we have to take care of first."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_24,I want to decide what I’m going to do with the Holy Sword first.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_25,...Okay.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_26,(That just makes me want to get him a better present...)
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_27,"(Oh, right!)"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_28,"Oh, I didn't realize the time has passed this much already... I will be back shortly, Frey."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_29,I was supposed to pick up firewood for camping.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_30,Sure! You do that.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_31,"Oooh, Kasel's birthday?"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_32,I know exactly what I should give him!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_33,"How about a King Slime? If not that, how about a gigantic, shiny golem?!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_34,Those are the things YOU want.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_35,No one wants a present like that except you.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_36,Hey!! I was being serious!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_37,"Hahaha, of course you were."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_38,Don't just laugh it off!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_39,"So Clause, was it? I get why Frey called you..."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_40,"But we haven’t known each other for long, and we both don’t know much about Kasel. I’m not sure if we are going to be of much help."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_41,I’m sorry if it was a bit too sudden.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_42,I had hoped that maybe we could use this chance to get to know each other more...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_43,"Also, since you already know what Kasel is going through,"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_44,I wanted all of us to enjoy the party and make Kasel feel a bit better.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_45,"Ah, that last sentence is what you really want, isn't it? Tee hee."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_46,"Oh come on, do you always have to point out something like that directly? *Sigh*"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_47,"Haha, you are pretty sharp, little lady."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_48,"I agree with Frey, though."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_49,"The fact that Kasel is now the new Master of the Holy Sword,"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_50,and that he has a long journey ahead of him...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_51,We are the only ones who know that.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_52,Kasel will walk an arduous path with a heavy burden on his back. I wish to encourage him even it’s just a little.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_53,"So please, just a tiny present of any sort will do."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_54,Please join us in the celebration of his birthday.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_55,Clause...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_56,Wow... You guys are really serious about this... In that case...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_57,.....Ummmmm...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_58,Hmm... How about this then?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_59,I knew Roi would come up with something! What is it?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_60,That’s going to be fun! I’m not sure if I will be able to pull it off well though!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_61,"Haha, looks like we are going to be busy from now."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_62,How about a slime? Can’t we do this with a slime?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_63,"......If you are really confident that you can do it, then by all means, go ahead."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_64,Huzzah!!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_65,Me... The Master of the Holy Sword...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_66,Am I really fit for such task? I’m just an apprentice knight...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_67,.......
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_68,*Sigh...* I should stop. I shouldn't make Clause and Frey worry.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_69,I will just have to give it some time... and accept it as time goes on.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_70,*Cough cough*... What's all this smoke? Is something on fire!?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_71,I knew this would happen...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_72,"Hey, come on! I tried my best, you know!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_73,Cleo is right. There are well-cooked ones as well.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_74,"*Sigh...* Sure, of course... I will just shut up now."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_75,"Oh, Kasel! You are back!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_76,We were just about to go out to look for you.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_77,Huh? Am I that late?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_78,"Haha, no no. You've come at the right time."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_79,But we should hurry. Everyone’s waiting.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_80,Huh? Um... Okay.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_81,Wh-what’s happening here?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_82,Kasel! Welcome back!!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_83,"We did our best to cook, but I’m not sure if you are going to like this."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_84,"We used... different ingredients this time, but it tastes okay!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_85,"Huh? You cooked a meal, Frey? Where did you get the ingredients from?"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_86,"Hee hee, you can thank this archmage right here!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_87,"Yeah, we had to throw out the slimes because you burned them too hard."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_88,Gahhhh! Shut up! One more word and I’m going to roast you and serve you as a meal!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_89,"Cleo, where do you get such sick ideas? Actually, you know what? Forget about it."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_90,"Anyway, I told them we cooked too much,"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_91,...but they told me you usually eat this much.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_92,"Hahahaha! Yeah, Kasel here is a big eater."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_93,"So, do you like what you see? This is your birthday present!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_94,All...of this?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_95,But I didn't give you anything... I’m not sure if I deserve this...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_96,Did you forget already?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_97,You already saved our lives once.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_98,"He’s right! Also, we are going to stick together for a while, you know!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_99,We are obviously going to care and celebrate your birthday! *Ahem...*
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_100,"We are friends, aren’t we?!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_101,You just wanted to say that...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_102,Hahaha.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_103,We know you are going through a hard time with many things to consider.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_104,Go ahead and enjoy. It's the least we can do for you.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_105,Roi is right. Today is that one special day of the year.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_106,Everyone placed so much effort in creating this... So take it!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_107,Clause... Everyone...
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_108,"(Yes, as long as I’m with these people...)"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_109,(As long as I have everyone by my side... I’m...)
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_110,"Happy birthday, Kasel!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_111,"...Thank you, everyone... Thank you so much!"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_112,This really is the birthday to remember for life!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_113,You ended up eating all of that. Cleo and Roi were so surprised.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_114,"Yeah, that was actually a bit embarrassing... Everyone’s used to seeing it now though, haha."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_115,"...We are also quite used to Cleo and Roi now, aren't we?"
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_116,Yeah. I feel like we’ve become close friends from then.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_117,We should host another party for your birthday in the future.
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_118,"We should invite Cleo, Roi, Clause..."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_119,and everyone we’ve met so far and for a grand party!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_120,"Hahaha, that sounds like fun."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_121,"I will count on you for another delicious feast then, Frey."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_122,Leave it to me!!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_123,There you were! Talking about something in secret?
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_124,We need you guys right now! Roi and Clause have something they wish to discuss with you!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_125,Okay! We will be there soon!!
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_126,"Let's go, Kasel."
E_C19_Oct_Kasel01_127,"Alright, Frey."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_01,It was 8 years ago.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_02,I don't remember much of that day.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_03,But I do remember the one large light that approached me
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_04,when I was sobbing sadly amid the black mist.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_05,"It embraced me warmly,"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_06,and that is the only faint memory I have of that day.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_07,"Mirianne,"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_08,"you are still young, but the world will not only see you as a little girl."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_09,"I shall remain as your home and the fence that protects you,"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_10,but I feel that you need means to protect yourself from any harm.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_11,"Here, take this."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_12,"Yes, grandpa."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_13,"Mirianne, what are you doing?"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_14,Oh! Sonia.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_15,I suddenly remembered that day when grandpa gave me this dagger.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_16,I guess I’m missing grandpa now..
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_17,We’ve been traveling together
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_18,away from the orphanage for a while.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_19,"Oh, that dagger is quite rusty."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_20,Yes. I’ve been using it all the time since the day
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_21,I learned how to use a dagger from grandpa.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_22,"I’m using a different dagger now,"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_23,but this is grandpa’s first present to me.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_24,I’ve always been carrying it since I got it from him.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_25,"Wow, I’m jealous of grandpa,"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_26,but I will not lose to him!
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_27,Here! This is my present!
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_28,This is what grandpa told me this before we left for this adventure.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_29,"Sonia, listen to me carefully."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_30,"As a guardian, you must care for your family."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_31,"Which means, don’t forget Mirianne’s birthday, and make her feel special that day! Hahaha!"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_32,"Sure! You can count on me, grandpa!"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_33,...I have to care for my family.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_34,Its name is Riventina.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_35,It is a magical blade enchanted with speed-accelerating spell and a returning spel-
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_36,"Thank you, Sonia!"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_37,"Ooof... Mirianne, I can’t breathe..."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_38,"(My friend, my family, and my soul mate"
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_39,"who accept me as who I am, and understand me..."
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_40,Sonia.
E_C19_Oct_Mirianne01_41,I hope this happiness lasts forever.)
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_01,Oh no... Too many souls corrupted by darkness...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_02,Rephy even lit the lamp... Is it not working?
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_03,Keep... your promise...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_04,No... Rephy made a promise... Rephy said he will guide... even the souls corrupted by darkness... to the blue star...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_05,Rephy must work harder... Rephy should...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_06,But Rephy can’t... stand up... 
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_07,There are still... so many lost souls that need me...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_08,Rephy... Wake up...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_09,Who... is it?
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_10,Someone is calling... Rephy... Who would...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_11,Why you... Hey... wake up...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_12,Familiar voice...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_13,Rephy knows this voice...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_14,Hey! I said wake up! Now!
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_15,Where am I..?
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_16,*Sigh...* How many times do I have to shout to wake you up?
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_17,"When your elder says something, you pay attention and listen!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_18,Chief? Something is not right... Rephy... became a Spiritual Guide... and left...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_19,"...Now, what are you babbling about? You still have so much to learn!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_20,"Anyway, this is important. Don’t doze off and listen carefully."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_21,Hmm? O-okay...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_22,Rephy... Um... Even if you would leave the town after becoming a Spiritual Guide...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_23,"when your birthday arrives, I want you to come back to your hometown."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_24,We will hold a big celebration for your birthday.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_25,"Hmm? Chief, Rephy’s birthday is still far away. I don’t under-"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_26,"Hey, I haven’t finished talking yet."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_27,"*Ahem...* I know I nag at you all the time,"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_28,but I also know how hard you are practicing to become a great Spiritual Guide.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_29,"Your birthday celebration is going to be grand, as you will be the pride of our kin in the future..."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_30,"So I know you will be busy, but on your birthday, please visit our village. Can you do that for me?"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_31,"Hm... Okay, chief! Rephy will come back to the village on my birthday even if I travel all over the world in the future!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_32,"Rephy, you are going to become a great Spiritual Guide. I know for sure."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_33,I will look forward to seeing you expertly guide the lost souls to the Starlight Bridge.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_34,Hehe. Thank you! Rephy will train hard to become a great Spiritual Guide who safely guides lost souls to the blue star!
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_35,"Haha, I am glad to hear that."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_36,"Now, I’ve finished telling you what I wanted to tell you. Go back to where you have to be."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_37,"Huh? What do you mean, chief? Eh... chief?"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_38,Go now.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_39,There are those waiting for you...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_40,"Even now, they're calling for you desperately."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_41,"Wait! Chief, Rephy doesn’t know what you are talking about!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_42,Chief!
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_43,"Oh, look here! He’s finally awake."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_44,Don't be afraid. We luckily found you lying unconscious in Galluah and brought you here.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_45,Where... is this place? Rephy was in-
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_46,You made me worry so much there!
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_47,I told you time after time to be careful! Just when will you listen?!
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_48,"Please calm down, chief. He is the one who lit the God’s Lamp for the souls of Galluah, after all."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_49,Yes... Rephy is okay. But why is chief and scholar lady here? You came to save Rephy?
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_50,"Not too long ago, Oddy visited Elidora and told me about you."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_51,He told me that you were heading to Ogria and asked if I could help you as you might lose your way.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_52,"The chief was with me at that time, so he helped me bring you back to safety."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_53,"Oh, hee hee... I see. Rephy will thank Uncle Oddy later."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_54,"...Are you really alright, Rephy?"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_55,I heard that you gave a part of your soul to the Undead to appease them.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_56,"Yes. Rephy is still a little tired, but chief and scholar lady are here now."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_57,So Rephy is fine.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_58,"I was actually asking to check something else... Anyway, it’s good that I can hand this over to you."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_59,"Here, take this. I made this especially for you."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_60,"Wow! This is Star Candy, our village’s specialty! Rephy’s favorite!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_61,"Happy birthday, Rephy."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_62,"I wanted to throw a grand celebration for your birthday, but... it seems I was out of luck this time."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_63,Birthday? Today is Rephy’s birthday?
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_64,"Come on, Rephy... You shouldn't forget your own birthday!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_65,"Oh, so today was the Spiritual Guide’s birthday? If I had known that, I would have prepared something..."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_66,"Hehe, it's okay! Both of you are here! That’s all Rephy needs!"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_67,"Since we are all here,"
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_68,I’m going to share this candy with everyone.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_69,Hmm... Thank you. I’m truly grateful for your hospitality.
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_70,"Haha, you’re all grown up now... Thank you."
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_71,Hee hee... Now then...
E_C19_Oct_Rephy01_72,Thanks for the candy!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_01,It’s been a while since I’ve had a break.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_02,I was too busy fulfilling Nyx and Rephy’s request...
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_03,"But since today is my birthday, I want to stay put and relax all day."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_04,"Hmm... According to what I’ve heard, Oddy should be here."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_05,Yes! I heard that Uncle Oddy sang happily and went to the beach!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_06,Nyx and Rephy?! What now?
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_07,"Haha, there you are, my friend! So you’ve been relaxing here!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_08,"It was so hard to find you, Uncle Oddy!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_09,The looks on your face tell me that...
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_10,You've brought new work!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_11,"However, today is my birthday. I want to just rest up and relax."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_12,So come ask for help next time!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_13,Oh! Uncle Oddy is running away!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_14,"No!! Don't go, Uncle Oddy!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_15,"Goodness, please listen to the rest!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_16,"Hmph, impressive! Now that’s my friend Oddy!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_17,"Y-you can compliment him later! Do something, Uncle Nyx!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_18,"Hahaha, sure! How about this?"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_19,*Huff* *Huff...* They aren't giving up!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_20,"Haha! Give up now, friend."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_21,"Ugh, I have no choice but to do this then!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_22,Well! Didn't expect him to use the space-time portal to run away!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_23,Uncle Oddy... Do you hate us that much?
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_24,"Haha, I’m sure he has another reason for doing that. Let’s wait for a bit. He will be back soon."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_25,"Ouch, my back..."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_26,Looks like they haven't followed me here.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_27,"Now, where is this place? "
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_28,"Wow, what a pretty landscape!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_29,Misty Hills... So this is where Rephy guides the souls to the Starlight Bridge?
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_30,It would have been nice to come here with him...
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_31,"Wait, what am I saying now?"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_32,I’m going to go back before I disturb the souls here.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_33,Ouch! Can’t I come out to someplace normal?
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_34,Let’s see... This place...
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_35,"Wow, what a beautiful lake!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_36,And those are... Ruins of a technomagic civilization!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_37,I remember when Nyx told me we should investigate it together.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_38,What a shame I didn't come here with him.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_39,"Wait, what am I saying again now?"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_40,.....
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_41,Hmm... I should go back before it gets more dangerous.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_42,Ouch! My buttocks!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_43,My bum is going through a lot today!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_44,"Now, what is this place... Oh, so I’ve arrived at Juno’s inn."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_45,Looks like someone's been preparing a party.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_46,That cake looks really delicious.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_47,"Happy birthday, Uncle Oddy!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_48,Oh... Ohh...
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_49,*Sob...* You folks are going to make me... cry!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_50,I hope Uncle Oddy comes quickly.
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_51,"Don't worry, Oddy knows how to be on time very well."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_52,"Just look at him. He’s here, see?"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_53,Nyx! Rephy! You little wondrous beings!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_54,"Haha, I told you to listen to the end."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_55,"You were so fast, Uncle Oddy! We didn't even have the chance to tell you!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_56,"But well, since you came at the right time, I guess we can call it mission accomplished."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_57,"Though I don’t know where you’ve been through, Uncle Oddy."
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_58,"Happy birthday, Oddy!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_59,"Happy birthday, Uncle Oddy!! Eat as much cake as you can!"
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_60,*Sob...* You cheeky adorable friends!
E_C19_Oct_Oddy01_61,Please stay close and be my friends forever!
