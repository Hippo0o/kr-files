Sub1_Viska_Title,Law of the Jungle
Sub1_Viska_1_1_1,Is it true that the Demons are causing a ruckus again?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_2,"You still haven't heard from the expedition? I heard that powerful Demons showed up and are going around, killing everyone."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_3,"And not only that... There's been many incidents, and the Holy Knights of the Church of Lua are being called every day."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_4,I don't think it's something that lowly soldiers like us can do anything about...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_5,That's why Demia from the Guardian Knights gave us the order.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_6,"We've been told that unless it's absolutely unavoidable, we should just run away."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_7,"Of course. We may be able to deal with one or two low-ranking Demons like Skeletons or Zombies,"
Sub1_Viska_1_1_8,but the Undead move in armies...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_9,And there's no way we can fight against high-ranking Demons.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_10,"Anyway, if Demons appear, we must report it first."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_11,...!?... Wait... Did you hear that?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_12,Someone's there... Who goes there!?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_13,*Yawn* I can smell it now... I suppose I should get going...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_14,Oh? Orvelia soldiers. Hello.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_15,Huh? Is that kid from around here?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_16,"Kid, where did you come from? It's dangerous outside because of the Demons. Go back home."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_17,Want me to take you home?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_18,"Huh? No, no need to. Anyway..."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_19,...?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_20,Aren't you in danger?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_21,Didn't you say the Demons have been causing a ruckus? You might die?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_22,"Well, this is our job..."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_23,"Since it's come to this, I'll tell you something good."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_24,Look far north. Can't you see something?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_25,"Hm...? No, I don't see anything..."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_26,"Wait, it looks like smoke..."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_27,Isn't that Lime Village near the northern sea?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_28,"Oh, Lime Village near the sea? That name sounds delicious."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_29,"Anyway, that village is about to fall."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_30,It will reach here soon.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_31,"The lowly Undead's large army, that is."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_32,Come on. There's no way those lowly Undeads made ships to come across the sea...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_33,"And even then, how would you know...?"
Sub1_Viska_1_1_34,!!!!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_35,"Look, they're already here."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_36,"Mister, wouldn't it be better if you run away now?"
Sub1_Viska_1_1_37,They really came across the sea... What was the navy doing!?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_38,Go back to the capital and report to Demia!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_39,What about you!?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_40,We can't leave a little girl alone! I'll take her to the closest fortress!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_41,Come here.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_42,It's gonna be alright. I'll protect you!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_43,...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_44,*Sigh.* Humans really are annoying.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_45,People who can't even take care of themselves are worrying about others.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_46,...?!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_47,A-a Demon!?
Sub1_Viska_1_1_48,"You couldn't tell? Keh heh... Well, I don't blame you for that."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_49,The owner of this body was a human after all. Heh heh heh heh!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_50,"And I'm a cute little girl, right? Of course, you wouldn't be able to tell."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_51,You evil Demon! You stole the body of a little girl...!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_52,"Stole? Heh heh heh, don't say that."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_53,"If it wasn't for me, this girl must have been eaten by the crows."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_54,"Without the contract with me, she would've died from the wound from another Demon."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_55,Shouldn't I be called her savior? Heh heh heh...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_56,Anyway.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_57,I have no interest in killing weaklings like you.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_58,Though it'll be different if you challenge me.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_59,Alright. I'll give you 10 seconds. Decide if you'll fight or run away.
Sub1_Viska_1_1_60,"But if you'll fight me, you better be prepared to die. Heh heh heh!"
Sub1_Viska_1_1_61,E-eek!
Sub1_Viska_1_1_62,"Just as I thought. Well, those obstacles are gone."
Sub1_Viska_1_1_63,I'm getting hungry...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_64,Well? There might be a high-ranking Demon leading those Undeads...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_65,I'm looking forward to it. Hm hm hm...
Sub1_Viska_1_1_66,Let's see... Shall I start hunting?
Sub1_Viska_1_2_1,You lowly Undeads are nothing!
Sub1_Viska_1_2_2,I can't even get full from you!
Sub1_Viska_1_2_3,"And you taste so bad! Ugh, no nutritional value whatsoever!"
Sub1_Viska_1_2_4,"And worst of all, I can't even get stronger!"
Sub1_Viska_1_2_5,Where's the strongest one? Is there no one!?
Sub1_Viska_1_2_6,I'll just kill you all! Kya ha ha ha!
Sub1_Viska_1_3_1,Oh? Are you the leader?
Sub1_Viska_1_3_2,You are pretty big... But you are still a lowly Undead.
Sub1_Viska_1_3_3,"And you look too hideous to taste good. No, you don't look like a leader..."
Sub1_Viska_1_3_4,Kya ha ha...!!!
Sub1_Viska_1_3_5,"Hm hm hm, I really shouldn't associate with Undeads."
Sub1_Viska_1_3_6,They can't even recognize a high-ranking Demon like myself.
Sub1_Viska_1_3_7,And you all keep challenging me! Trash!
Sub1_Viska_1_4_1,*Spit* Ugh. It tastes disgusting.
Sub1_Viska_1_4_2,Fine. I got the information I needed from that soul I ate.
Sub1_Viska_1_4_3,"Malduk is their master, huh?"
Sub1_Viska_1_4_4,Malduk. I don't think I've heard that name before in the Demon's World...
Sub1_Viska_1_4_5,Did he become a Demon on this side? He became Angmund's adviser right after becoming a lich...
Sub1_Viska_1_4_6,"He might be strong, then. I don't like the fact that he's an Undead, though..."
Sub1_Viska_1_4_7,"Oh, well. It was my goal to eat and absorb Angmund and all his followers, anyway."
Sub1_Viska_1_4_8,"So, I have to go to Galluah Plains? I don't think I can go across the sea by myself..."
Sub1_Viska_1_4_9,"Oh, well!"
Sub1_Viska_1_4_10,I'm sure I'll get there if I keep walking. La la la.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_1,The energy from this forest is quite powerful.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_2,"Though it's not quite a good fit for me, since I'm a Demon..."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_3,Huh?
Sub1_Viska_2_1_4,I think I can smell Undeads on that side...
Sub1_Viska_2_1_5,"Hm. Yes, my sense of smell is good."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_6,"It's from the sea, so they probably took a ship from Galluah Plains."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_7,Tsk. But this bunch of humans is too damn weak.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_8,They are having a hard time against those trashy Skeletons...
Sub1_Viska_2_1_9,It's pathetic.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_10,Hmph. Who cares about the magic that those lowly Demons are using to make a lowly army?
Sub1_Viska_2_1_11,Who cares?
Sub1_Viska_2_1_12,"Now, I suppose I should get going..."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_13,Huh?
Sub1_Viska_2_1_14,Evil Demons! Leave Elidora!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_15,You dared to corrupt the queen and insult the pride of the Harpies!?
Sub1_Viska_2_1_16,"Get lost, Demons!"
Sub1_Viska_2_1_17,I'll destroy you all so you never dare corrupt Elidora again!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_18,"And you, the Demon hiding there!"
Sub1_Viska_2_1_19,Stop hiding and come out!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_20,"How annoying. Well, it can't be helped."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_21,How did you know? I'm pretty sure I should've been sensed as a human.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_22,Ask the wind surrounding you!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_23,Haaaa!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_24,"Wait, wait. Calm down."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_25,I'm not related to those trashy Undeads.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_26,I'm on the way to eat the master of those Undeads.
Sub1_Viska_2_1_27,"So, can't you just let me pass?"
Sub1_Viska_2_1_28,Eat...?
Sub1_Viska_2_1_29,I don't know what you mean... But you're still a Demon! You're our enemy!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_30,There's no way I'll trust anything that a Demon says!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_31,If I think about what you've done to us...!
Sub1_Viska_2_1_32,"Come on, you're so stuck up."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_33,"Well, if you don't get it, I'll have to show you my skills."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_34,"Come at me, birdbrain."
Sub1_Viska_2_1_35,"Don't underestimate me, Demon!"
Sub1_Viska_2_2_1,Tsk!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_2,Totally different... From the ones before...!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_3,Hmph. You're pretty good for a birdbrain!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_4,I thought everyone here was a weakling.
Sub1_Viska_2_2_5,It looks like I'll have some fun! Kya ha ha!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_6,"I told you to not underestimate Harpy warriors, Demon!"
Sub1_Viska_2_2_7,I can still fight!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_8,"Don't make me laugh, birdbrain."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_9,You don't look too well...
Sub1_Viska_2_2_10,"If you continue to fight, the result is obvious."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_11,"And I don't think you would taste good, anyway. Hm."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_12,You keep talking about eating. What kind of Demon are you?
Sub1_Viska_2_2_13,Hm hm. Me?
Sub1_Viska_2_2_14,I'm Viska.
Sub1_Viska_2_2_15,"I eat the souls of strong Demons to get stronger,"
Sub1_Viska_2_2_16,"and when I'm finished, I'll be the greatest Demon, the Dark Lord!"
Sub1_Viska_2_2_17,Dark Lord?
Sub1_Viska_2_2_18,What the...?
Sub1_Viska_2_2_19,"Hey, don't talk like that about someone else's dream."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_20,What's wrong with wanting to be the greatest?
Sub1_Viska_2_2_21,...
Sub1_Viska_2_2_22,"Anyway, I'm on the way to eat the leader of those Undeads."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_23,"I'll eat him, grow stronger... And eat some more if there's anything good on the way. Heh heh..."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_24,...!!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_25,"Don't worry, birdbrain."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_26,I have no interest in the souls of creatures from the earthly realm.
Sub1_Viska_2_2_27,"Well, I may be interested in your food, though."
Sub1_Viska_2_2_28,"Anyway, I'm on the way to eat their leader, so don't get in my way. Got it?"
Sub1_Viska_2_2_29,Bye!
Sub1_Viska_2_2_30,...
Sub1_Viska_2_2_31,A Demon that hunts other Demons?
Sub1_Viska_2_2_32,I'll have to report this to the Elves.
Sub1_Viska_3_1_1,*Sniff* The smell of blood is thick.
Sub1_Viska_3_1_2,Is it because it's right next to the Galluah Plains?
Sub1_Viska_3_1_3,That Malduk... He must be trying to get more corpses.
Sub1_Viska_3_1_4,I'll follow the smell for now.
Sub1_Viska_3_2_1,"Hm, this is..."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_2,Gahhh!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_3,Guh...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_4,Tsk. Just as I thought...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_5,Another group of weak Undeads?
Sub1_Viska_3_2_6,So boring.
Sub1_Viska_3_2_7,Let's see...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_8,"Warriors, to the front! Buy time for the shamans to cast spells!"
Sub1_Viska_3_2_9,We'll get rid of those Undeads with the powerful magic!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_10,Let the corpses of our comrades free!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_11,Woooo!!!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_12,Oh? Are they preparing something big?
Sub1_Viska_3_2_13,But...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_14,Rain... Wind... Lightning!!!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_15,"Kuh, there's no end...!"
Sub1_Viska_3_2_16,"They keep rising, unless they're even burned!"
Sub1_Viska_3_2_17,Even the warriors are getting tired...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_18,We don't have a choice...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_19,We'll retreat for now and reorganize!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_20,"Well, this was the obvious outcome."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_21,"They fought pretty well for earthly creatures, but that's their limit."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_22,"Well, I'll get going... No, wait."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_23,I think I heard something about Orvel...
Sub1_Viska_3_2_24,"Right, there's a traditional dish with a special sauce from the Orcs of Ogria..."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_25,A delicious boar dish!
Sub1_Viska_3_2_26,Hmm... I wonder what it tastes like?
Sub1_Viska_3_2_27,"...Well, it can't be helped. I'll have to go see..."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_28,"Boar, boar, delicious boar..."
Sub1_Viska_3_2_29,Move! I'll go back to the base... hm!?
Sub1_Viska_3_3_1,Gahhh...
Sub1_Viska_3_3_2,Ugh...
Sub1_Viska_3_3_3,There really are a lot of them.
Sub1_Viska_3_3_4,"Oh, well. Even bad souls are enough for some energy..."
Sub1_Viska_3_3_5,All of you will be skewered!
Sub1_Viska_3_3_6,That's... a Demon!? Why is a Demon helping...?
Sub1_Viska_3_3_7,"And those Undeads that kept rising, even after being hit by powerful magic..."
Sub1_Viska_3_3_8,They're unable to get up after getting hit with those thorns...
Sub1_Viska_3_4_1,This is the end!!!
Sub1_Viska_3_4_2,Gwah...
Sub1_Viska_3_4_3,Ugh. Tastes so bad. I feel like I'm gonna throw up...
Sub1_Viska_3_4_4,Are you alright?
Sub1_Viska_3_4_5,I would like to thank you first.
Sub1_Viska_3_4_6,"I'm Kaulah, deputy chief of the Orcs."
Sub1_Viska_3_4_7,Aren't you a Demon...? Why would you...?
Sub1_Viska_3_4_8,Ugh. Please wait...
Sub1_Viska_3_4_9,I had so much nasty food that I feel like throwing up... Kuh.
Sub1_Viska_3_4_10,Ugh. I think I might feel better if I have some delicious boar...
Sub1_Viska_3_4_11,...
Sub1_Viska_3_4_12,...Hm. Is that so?
Sub1_Viska_3_4_13,"Follow me, then."
Sub1_Viska_3_4_14,I'll make the greatest traditional food of the Orcs.
Sub1_Viska_3_4_15,"(Yes, this is exactly what I wanted!)"
Sub1_Viska_3_5_1,"Wow, I'm full."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_2,Just as I thought!
Sub1_Viska_3_5_3,And it's so much food! It tastes great!
Sub1_Viska_3_5_4,The food of the earthly realm is really good.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_5,Ha ha ha! I did well in saving those Orcs.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_6,Ha ha ha. I'm glad you like it.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_7,"What did you say at the end, though?"
Sub1_Viska_3_5_8,"Huh? N-nothing. It's so good, that my stomach might explode."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_9,"Ha ha, alright."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_10,I wanted to thank you once again for helping us.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_11,But also...
Sub1_Viska_3_5_12,There are some amongst my men who think you are dangerous.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_13,So if you are done here... I would like to ask you to leave.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_14,"Hm. You're smart. Well, it's understandable."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_15,"I got it. I'm done with my business, and I'm feeling good, so I'll leave."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_16,I hope that didn't hurt your feelings.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_17,"But as the leader of my tribe, I would like to know the name of our savior..."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_18,"Heh heh, if you say so."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_19,My name is Viska.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_20,The Great Demon that will become the Dark Lord!
Sub1_Viska_3_5_21,..? Dark Lord?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_22,Why? Why are you staring at me like that?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_23,Hm... Nothing. I just thought it was interesting.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_24,Why do you want to become the Dark Lord?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_25,Being the Dark Lord means being the best!
Sub1_Viska_3_5_26,"Then, I'll be able to eat whatever I want, and do whatever I want."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_27,"Basically, it means that I'll have the most fun. Heh heh heh."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_28,"Well, becoming the greatest has meaning in itself, I suppose."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_29,Let me ask you something.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_30,"If you become the Dark Lord, what will you do about the earthly realm?"
Sub1_Viska_3_5_31,Huh? There's no use in bothering the weak races of the earthly realm.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_32,"It's not like your souls taste good. As long as I'm not bothered, I won't bother you."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_33,It would be better to let you live and make me good food.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_34,"I'll come by sometimes to eat, so treat me well! Heh heh heh..."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_35,Hm... You are one interesting Demon.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_36,May I ask why you decided to help us?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_37,I wanted to eat boar... Hm.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_38,"Oh, hm... I think there was someone named Malduk..."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_39,I heard he's a pretty strong Demon.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_40,I heard he's in the Galluah Plains. Isn't it around here?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_41,"Since it's nearby, I thought I might find out something good..."
Sub1_Viska_3_5_42,Hm...
Sub1_Viska_3_5_43,What will you do once I tell you?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_44,Isn't it obvious?
Sub1_Viska_3_5_45,I'll go and eat him.
Sub1_Viska_3_5_46,I'll devour the last piece of his soul. All of it. Heh heh heh heh...
Sub1_Viska_4_1_1,"So it's the hidden lab in the Galluah Plains, huh?"
Sub1_Viska_4_1_2,It should be around here according to that Orc shaman.
Sub1_Viska_4_1_3,I see many low-ranking Demons and Undeads... but an entrance to a lab?
Sub1_Viska_4_1_4,...
Sub1_Viska_4_1_5,"Ugh, fine."
Sub1_Viska_4_1_6,I'll kill them all until I see it!
Sub1_Viska_4_2_1,I was wondering who was causing all that noise.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_2,Who are you?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_3,Who do you think?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_4,"I'm Viska, and I'm here to eat you!"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_5,Hm. I heard from the Demons...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_6,"So, you're that Demon Eater?"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_7,Interesting. A strange Demon that absorbs power...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_8,"I heard you ate the queen of nightmares, Kitrax."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_9,"Oh, that woman that looked like a horse? She was good. Very delicious."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_10,Wonderful. I've been looking for another prey like that...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_11,"But looking at you, I don't think you'll be as good."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_12,"Hahaha, such a feisty mouth."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_13,"Epis, you, and all traitors are the same..."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_14,You don't even think about working for Demons.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_15,Don't make me laugh. Since when have Demons worked as a group?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_16,"Well, that's enough. I don't want to waste time talking to my food."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_17,Die and become part of my power!
Sub1_Viska_4_2_18,Ugh!? What's this nasty feeling...?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_19,Heh. This is a special trap I prepared in case that traitor Epis appeared again.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_20,"It's a pity I wasn't able to capture Epis, but I'll be content with you."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_21,Kwa ha ha ha. It's a good thing I studied her curse.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_22,My body... can't...!
Sub1_Viska_4_2_23,"As long as we're in the earthly realm, it's easy to take care of Demons whose real power is just in the mind."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_24,"This curse separates the body and mind. Once the mind is dispersed, that body is just an empty doll."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_25,Stay calm and wait there. I'll wait until you get weak and use you as a test material.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_26,I'm already looking forward to researching that power. Kwa ha ha ha!!!
Sub1_Viska_4_2_27,Kuh...!
Sub1_Viska_4_2_28,Tsk. Did the contract get canceled since my mind was separated from her?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_29,The container of that curse... Did he copy her power somehow? Disgusting...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_30,Hm...?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_31,But I still have a way...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_32,"Hey, girl. Can you hear me?"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_33,......
Sub1_Viska_4_2_34,The Demon from the contract...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_35,What happened...?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_36,Am I alive...?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_37,Of course you are.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_38,I've kept my side of the contract to keep you alive.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_39,Really...? I see...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_40,And this power from my body...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_41,"So, the power I absorbed remained in that body. That's what he meant by research."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_42,"Hey, human. Let's have another contract."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_43,Leave your body to me.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_44,....
Sub1_Viska_4_2_45,Don't feel like it.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_46,...What? Did I hear that correctly?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_47,I said I don't feel like it.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_48,When you use my body...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_49,S-scary things happen...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_50,*...Sigh.* Hey.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_51,Have you forgotten?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_52,The anger from that day. The pain from that day.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_53,Our first meeting was very powerful.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_54,"Your friends, family, and parents had become ground meat,"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_55,"and you were cut up by a Demon's blade, dripping blood, squirming."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_56,Saying you didn't want to die. That you wanted to live. You asked for help. Whoever it was.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_57,And who was the one that helped you then?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_58,...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_59,"Right? It was just me, right?"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_60,No one is nice to the weak.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_61,That's the law of the jungle. Only the strong survive.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_62,"If you are weak, you get eaten. If you are strong, you eat others."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_63,You are right.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_64,But your power is with me now...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_65,"I was asleep, but I saw you fight, so I kind of know how to use it..."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_66,Yes. If I can use this power to help people...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_67,Keh heh... Ha ha ha! You really think so!?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_68,"Yes, you have the power."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_69,But how much of that power do you think you can take?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_70,"And even then, who do you think will understand you?"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_71,You are no longer just a human.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_72,"For humans, you are just like a Demon."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_73,"Hm. You are a Demon-human, now."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_74,"Everyone you meet will treat you like a monster, and think of how to get rid of you."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_75,So? You think you can live with that?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_76,Ugh...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_77,"And you only saw how it is used, but you never used it yourself."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_78,"You'll just die again, without being able to do anything."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_79,We don't have time. Make another deal with me.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_80,"If you don't act now, you'll become Malduk's test subject forever."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_81,...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_82,"...You're scared, too."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_83,...What?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_84,"Now that we don't have a contract, if I don't agree, you can never use my body again."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_85,"And all the power you accumulated so far is in my body,"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_86,so you can't do anything. You'll also die at Malduk's hands.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_87,Hmph. You have a point.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_88,But I don't think you'll make that choice.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_89,And this is also a contract for you.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_90,...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_91,"Don't be so on edge, human."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_92,"I told you when we first agreed to make our contract, right? I wouldn't let you die."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_93,"Even if our contract has been temporarily broken, I keep my promises."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_94,Don't compare me to those lowly Demons or humans who don't keep promises.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_95,You don't understand why I'm asking for another contract?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_96,....
Sub1_Viska_4_2_97,This is good for both of us.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_98,Your body isn't strong...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_99,But it's good to use on enemies who underestimate you.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_100,And it's good to stay among the humans to get work done.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_101,"And what's more, we can eat lots of good food by using your cute appearance."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_102,"Well, I also like eating..."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_103,Right? Hm hm hm... And you know. If you sign another contract with me...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_104,You can continue your revenge on the Demons for as long as you want.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_105,...!!
Sub1_Viska_4_2_106,"What, you thought I didn't know?"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_107,"Of course, I know. As someone who shares your body, it's obvious what you're thinking."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_108,"While you were asleep, I saw through your memories."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_109,"Not only that. Whenever you woke up for a little while, it was when I was killing Demons."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_110,It's proof that you were also enjoying it.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_111,"Your parents, your friends, your neighbors."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_112,"You hate the Demons who killed them, right? They're unforgivable?"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_113,That's natural.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_114,"Tell me honestly. You hate being with me, too."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_115,"Yes, you are right."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_116,"I hate Demons, I despise them, and I can't forgive them."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_117,I don't even want to acknowledge the fact that I'm sharing my body with a Demon.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_118,But when those Demons were dying in front of my eyes...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_119,I felt somewhat relieved...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_120,"Right? SO, let's sign another contract."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_121,"Like I said earlier. If we take too long, you'll become Malduk's test subject forever."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_122,Alright. I have one condition.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_123,Condition?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_124,"Well, fine. Let's hear it."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_125,You were the one controlling my body before. But now that I'm awake...
Sub1_Viska_4_2_126,"Let me use my body, too."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_127,And teach me how to fight.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_128,"From now on, I'll kill them with my own hands...!!!"
Sub1_Viska_4_2_129,....
Sub1_Viska_4_2_130,Hmph. That's the right mindset.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_131,"You're weak, but you still want to get stronger. And you're willing to put in the work."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_132,"Those are virtues that I, as a great Demon, like."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_133,"Alright, I accept that condition."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_134,Are you ready?
Sub1_Viska_4_2_135,...Yes.
Sub1_Viska_4_2_136,"...Alright, give me your hand."
Sub1_Viska_4_2_137,It will be done soon...
Sub1_Viska_4_3_1,Phew. I finally got rid of that annoying curse.
Sub1_Viska_4_3_2,"He just copied her curse, but it didn't feel like an actual one."
Sub1_Viska_4_3_3,The curse she cast on me in the Demon World... Ugh. I don't even want to think about it.
Sub1_Viska_4_3_4,Well. Shall I go get rid of that dirty lich now!?
Sub1_Viska_4_4_1,"Found you, Malduk!"
Sub1_Viska_4_4_2,...!! Y-you got rid of that curse...! It took me so long to research and perfect it...!
Sub1_Viska_4_4_3,How did you do it!?
Sub1_Viska_4_4_4,Heh heh heh. This is a human's body. As long as it's in a contract with my soul...
Sub1_Viska_4_4_5,There's no way I will lose this body!
Sub1_Viska_4_4_6,No way! The spell I worked on for years was undone by a human soul...!
Sub1_Viska_4_4_7,"Damn... Then, I'll put you on the testing bench myself!"
Sub1_Viska_4_4_8,"Heh. Yeah, right. I want to see you try!"
Sub1_Viska_4_4_9,I'll cut you up and eat you!
Sub1_Viska_4_4_10,Hmph. Let's see how long you can talk like that.
Sub1_Viska_4_4_11,"Rise, Obrigard!"
Sub1_Viska_4_4_12,"Rise, my elite soldiers!"
Sub1_Viska_4_4_13,Capture that traitor Demon and bring her before me!
Sub1_Viska_4_4_14,Kya ha ha ha!
Sub1_Viska_4_4_15,You think you can use those lowly things to stop me!?
Sub1_Viska_4_4_16,"Come at me, Undeads!"
Sub1_Viska_4_4_17,I'll get rid of all of you!!!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_1,"Kuh, damn!"
Sub1_Viska_4_5_2,If it wasn't for the wound from the owner of the Holy Sword and the vestige of Gray!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_3,To be humiliated by a traitor Demon...!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_4,Kuh. I'll have to retreat for now!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_5,I'll go back to Gargoss and report about the situation here...!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_6,Tsk. I was sure I raked out his soul... Was he protected by another spell?
Sub1_Viska_4_5_7,Damn. That rat... So annoying!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_8,He said Gargoss... Alright. Let's see who wins in the end.
Sub1_Viska_4_5_9,Just wait until I get you... I'll rip up your soul until there's nothing left!!!
Sub1_Viska_4_5_10,...
Sub1_Viska_4_5_11,That's... Hm.
Sub1_Viska_4_5_12,"Things are going to get interesting, huh?"
