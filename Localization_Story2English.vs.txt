CONVERSATION_TU_12,"Phew...This isn't easy, even for me."
CONVERSATION_TU_12B,"While I knew how tough Demons are,"
CONVERSATION_TU_13,"but I didn't think they'd be this persistent. I don't like it when they act all clingy..."
CONVERSATION_TU_14,"Isn't that a shame, you traitor."
CONVERSATION_TU_15,"!"
CONVERSATION_TU_16,"Malduk... Of course."

CONVERSATION_TU_22B,"Onwards, evil spirits!"

CONVERSATION_TU_24,"We're outnumbered. We can't take them all."
CONVERSATION_TU_25,"Ugh. I've also reached my limit."
CONVERSATION_TU_26,"We should pull back, Kyle."
CONVERSATION_TU_26B,"Any more and...!"
CONVERSATION_TU_27,"We can't afford to do that! An opportunity like this won't come again."

CONVERSATION_TU_66,"What are you doing here?"
CONVERSATION_TU_67,"This is the pit."
CONVERSATION_TU_68,"Unlike the Arena, this is a dangerous place."
CONVERSATION_TU_69,"Heh heh. But the rewards are greater."
CONVERSATION_TU_70,"If you feel up to it, give it a try."
CONVERSATION_TU_71,"Stop! Identify yourself!"
CONVERSATION_TU_72,"My name is Kasel, a squire in service to Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_TU_73,"I have been summoned here."
CONVERSATION_TU_74,"Ahh, you are Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_75,"We have been waiting for you."
CONVERSATION_TU_76,"We discovered a hidden vault under the royal chambers."
CONVERSATION_TU_77,"Much wealth has been uncovered, but monsters keep appearing."
CONVERSATION_TU_78,"We ask that you eliminate the monsters for the safety of Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_TU_79,"I'm at your service, sir."
CONVERSATION_TU_87,"Hello there, young, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_TU_88,"I think someone is calling you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_89,"Yeah, right..."
CONVERSATION_TU_90,"Hello. My name is May and I work at the Shop."
CONVERSATION_TU_91,"We're handing out gifts in celebration of our store's grand opening."
CONVERSATION_TU_92,"If you come visit us, sir, we'll have something even more special for you!"
CONVERSATION_TU_93,"Th-thank you..."
CONVERSATION_TU_94,"Heh, let's go take a look at the shop, young, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_TU_95,"Frey, I'm already embarrassed enough, so please don't..."
CONVERSATION_TU_96,"Welcome to May's General Shop!"
CONVERSATION_TU_97,"We have weapons and armor that will suit a young, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_TU_98,"Tap the Shop button to go to the shop!"
CONVERSATION_TU_99,"You can use Rubies to refresh the Items list, too!"
CONVERSATION_TU_100,"But if you browse and leave without buying anything..."
CONVERSATION_TU_101,"May will be very disappointed!"
CONVERSATION_TU_102,"Heh. Looks like you have no choice, Mr. Young, Handsome Knight."
CONVERSATION_TU_103,"Please stop, Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_TU_104,"About a century ago, a lone wizard opened the Demon's Gate\nand allowed Demons to invade the entire continent."
CONVERSATION_TU_105,"As the land went up in flames, heroes rose up against the Demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_106,"The heroes pushed past the Demons\nand arrived at the Dark Lord's fortress."
CONVERSATION_TU_107,"Kyle slew the Dark Lord with the Holy Sword of Aea,\nand then vanished leaving only the holy sword behind."
CONVERSATION_TU_108,"The leaderless Demons dispersed across the continent,"
CONVERSATION_TU_108A,"And the heroes sealed the holy sword in the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_TU_109,"A hundred years later, peace has been restored to the continent,\nand the wounds of the old war have been long forgotten."
CONVERSATION_TU_110,"Yet one peaceful day, Demon activity was sensed near the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_TU_111,"Orvel, the realm of humans, sent an expedition party\nto investigate the Demon situation."
CONVERSATION_TU_114,"Kasel, the edge of your sword looks very worn."
CONVERSATION_TU_115,"Yeah. I've been using it since I was on the city watch."
CONVERSATION_TU_116,"Don't you have a second sword? Why don't you use it?"
CONVERSATION_TU_117,"Uh... how do I do that?"
CONVERSATION_TU_118,"First, tap the Heroes button and select a hero to go to the Hero Info window."
CONVERSATION_TU_119,"Tap the item you want to equip, and then tap the Equip button."
CONVERSATION_TU_120,"It's not hard, give it a try!"
CONVERSATION_TU_121,"Um, the sword is not bad, but something is amiss."
CONVERSATION_TU_122,"Then you should enhance the item."
CONVERSATION_TU_123,"Enhance?"
CONVERSATION_TU_124,"All items can be enhanced regardless of their type."
CONVERSATION_TU_125,"Once an item has been enhanced, its abilities are strengthened."
CONVERSATION_TU_126,"Enhancing an item is similar to equipping items. Tap the Enhance button instead of Equip."
CONVERSATION_TU_127,"Let's get started, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_TU_128,"Hmm... My skills don't seem to deal much damage to enemies."
CONVERSATION_TU_129,"How about acquiring a new skill attribute?"
CONVERSATION_TU_130,"Skill attribute?"
CONVERSATION_TU_131,"Did you finish knighthood training, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_TU_132,"Ha ha ha. Of course I did!"
CONVERSATION_TU_133,"Oh well, it can't be helped. Do you have any skill books?"
CONVERSATION_TU_134,"There is an attribute you can pick up with the skill books you already have, Kasel. Let's try it!"
CONVERSATION_TU_135,"How do I do that?"
CONVERSATION_TU_136,"First, open the Hero window and select the hero whose skills you want to enhance."
CONVERSATION_TU_137,"Tap Skills to open the skills window, and then tap the skill for the attribute you want to acquire."
CONVERSATION_TU_138,"There will be an Acquire Attribute button. You can enhance your skill attributes if you have enough skill books."
CONVERSATION_TU_139,"Let's give it a try!"
CONVERSATION_TU_175,"Not only do you acquire better skill attributes,"
CONVERSATION_TU_176,"but you can also enhance skills to a number equal to your current level."
CONVERSATION_TU_177,"Enhancing skills consumes Gold, so be sure to save up for future costs!"
CONVERSATION_TU_178,"Try enhancing your skills, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_179,"Hm. That looks like a goblin base."
CONVERSATION_TU_180,"Could that be an outpost?"
CONVERSATION_TU_181,"It's highly likely. I see why the number of goblins have increased."
CONVERSATION_TU_182,"I was wondering where they were coming from. It looks like they've set up their camp here."
CONVERSATION_TU_183,"Let's destroy it before they attack another village."
CONVERSATION_TU_184,"Got it."
CONVERSATION_TU_185,"Good. A knight needs that kind of mettle."
CONVERSATION_TU_186,"Lead the way, I'll cover your back."
CONVERSATION_TU_187,"Thank you."
CONVERSATION_TU_188,"Huff, puff. That was quite a difficult fight."
CONVERSATION_TU_189,"Yes, but we gained a fair amount of loot at last."
CONVERSATION_TU_190,"There may be a few more outposts similar to this one."
CONVERSATION_TU_191,"We have no obligation to dispose them, but we'll get  loot if we do!"
CONVERSATION_TU_192,"I'll leave it up to you."
CONVERSATION_TU_193,"Sure."
CONVERSATION_TU_194,"Then let's keep going."
CONVERSATION_TU_195,"Wait, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_196,"What is it, Frey?"
CONVERSATION_TU_197,"The wolves we caught earlier dropped some armor."
CONVERSATION_TU_198,"It looks tougher than what you have on right now."
CONVERSATION_TU_199,"But the battle is about to start..."
CONVERSATION_TU_200,"Haha. There is a simple way to equip gear before the battle starts."
CONVERSATION_TU_201,"How?"
CONVERSATION_TU_202,"Tap and hold the portrait of the hero on this screen."
CONVERSATION_TU_203,"Then you can jump to the corresponding Hero Info window."
CONVERSATION_TU_204,"Tap the Gear button in the Hero Info window,"
CONVERSATION_TU_205,"and then tap the Auto Equip button below."
CONVERSATION_TU_206,"This way you can easily equip gear."
CONVERSATION_TU_207,"Wow, that really is helpful!"
CONVERSATION_TU_208,"Thanks, Frey."
CONVERSATION_TU_209,"Glad to help."
CONVERSATION_TU_210,"Ugh!"
CONVERSATION_TU_211,"What's wrong, Miss Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_TU_212,"I was in such a hurry to leave the Tower of the Sages,"
CONVERSATION_TU_213,"I forgot my best staff!"
CONVERSATION_TU_214,"Of course, it's not like my flames are any weaker without my staff..."
CONVERSATION_TU_215,"Why don't you try the Special Shop, Miss Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_TU_216,"Special what?"
CONVERSATION_TU_217,"You can summon special items from the Special Shop."
CONVERSATION_TU_218,"We may even find high-quality items that suit you, Miss Cleo."
CONVERSATION_TU_219,"Oh... Of course, I knew that. Yes, indeed."
CONVERSATION_TU_220,"Well, let's quickly go to the Special Shop and summon some special items!"
CONVERSATION_TU_221,"Oh no! I left my sword back there... This worn sword, on the other hand..."
CONVERSATION_TU_222,"A warrior without his sword. I predict a bleak future."
CONVERSATION_TU_223,"Right? Hahaha..."
CONVERSATION_TU_224,"Huhu, Kasel! I brought it!"
CONVERSATION_TU_225,"When I was looking for you, I noticed you had left your sword behind in your room..."
CONVERSATION_TU_226,"Wow! Frey, thank you!"
CONVERSATION_TU_227,"You're welcome! In the future, don't leave your equipment laying around!"
CONVERSATION_TU_228,"This sword... I feel the great power of the Goddess Lua."
CONVERSATION_TU_229,"I wanna try using it!"
CONVERSATION_TU_230,"The holy sword doesn't reveal its power to anyone but its true owner."
CONVERSATION_TU_236,"Try equipping this rune on the Holy Sword Aea."
CONVERSATION_TU_237,"Runes enchant gear with special effects."
CONVERSATION_TU_238,"This pebble can do that?"
CONVERSATION_TU_239,"Pebble?!"
CONVERSATION_TU_240,"Runes are precious artifacts that contain magic powers!"
CONVERSATION_TU_241,"Unfortunately, there aren’t too many pieces of equipment that can handle the true power of runes."
CONVERSATION_TU_242,"Ok, ok. Why don't you give it a try, Kasel? Let's see if she's speaking the truth."
CONVERSATION_TU_243,"I'm not lying!"
CONVERSATION_TU_244,"For sure... I can feel more strength compared to before."
CONVERSATION_TU_245,"As you grow stronger, Kasel, you will be able to exert greater powers."
CONVERSATION_TU_246,"I want one of those, too!"
CONVERSATION_TU_247,"Roi! Go and find me one! That's an order!"
CONVERSATION_TU_248,"Don't feel like it."
CONVERSATION_HERO_EMPTY,"You have connected with many heroes already!\nPlease come again!"
