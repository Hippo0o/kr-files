Sub1_Ophelia_1_1,I dreamed a dream.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_2,A dream where the whole world was slowly being consumed by darkness. A dream I never wish to dream again.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_3,All I could do was watch the world fall into darkness.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_4,I dreamed a dream.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_5,About he who shone his way to my side as sunshine when I was sobbing like a little child.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_6,"When he reached out his hand,"
Sub1_Ophelia_1_7,"flowers bloomed into a thousand colors,"
Sub1_Ophelia_1_8,"the earth and sky regained their lushness,"
Sub1_Ophelia_1_9,and the sun chased the darkness away.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_10,"When I woke up from the dream,"
Sub1_Ophelia_1_11,"I could not remember the face, "
Sub1_Ophelia_1_12,nor the voice-
Sub1_Ophelia_1_13,but I still remember the warmth of the pat on my back.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_14,Which is why I must meet this person.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_15,My guide. 
Sub1_Ophelia_1_16,My stars.
Sub1_Ophelia_1_17,My destiny.
Sub1_Ophelia_2_1,Err... It’s already been a month since I parted with Stardust.
Sub1_Ophelia_2_2,I wonder if the leader has crossed the continent by now?
Sub1_Ophelia_2_3,This trip... It’s gonna be great! I even dreamed of him!
Sub1_Ophelia_2_4,"Right, guys?"
Sub1_Ophelia_2_5,"Ahaha! Guys, that tickles!"
Sub1_Ophelia_2_6,"Dear Magical Tarot Carriage, please hurry us to the World Tree!"
Sub1_Ophelia_3_1,Have you ever heard the whispers of a star?
Sub1_Ophelia_3_2,The clear yet mysterious sounds
Sub1_Ophelia_3_3,For today is the day—
Sub1_Ophelia_3_4,Every astrologer will gather here to observe the skies above this very place.
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5,"The holy land where astrology emerged, the World Tree."
Sub1_Ophelia_3_6,"Wow... So crowded. Well, today is a very special day after all."
Sub1_Ophelia_3_7,"I, Ophelia the witch,"
Sub1_Ophelia_3_8,have come to offer my prayer to the World Tree as a diviner of the stars.
Sub1_Ophelia_3_9,"Please guide my path so that I can see the light in the eyes of the people,"
Sub1_Ophelia_3_10,and... If you could please make my beloved the most handsome of...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_11,Shush! You’re always like that whenever we’re here. You need to behave yourself. This is a holy place. 
Sub1_Ophelia_3_12,Huh...? Vellekia!! Where are you going?!
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13,It’s dangerous to wander off like that here!
Sub1_Ophelia_3_14,Vellekia? Are you there?
Sub1_Ophelia_3_15,...What’s that light...?
Sub1_Ophelia_3_16,Huh? A magic circle?
Sub1_Ophelia_3_17,Whoa!
Sub1_Ophelia_3_18,I knew that you would come.
Sub1_Ophelia_3_19,You who became my last dream...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_20,Who are-
Sub1_Ophelia_4_1,Ugh... My head! What in the world just happened?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_2,What is this place?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_3,Is everyone okay?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_4,...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_5,Huh...?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_6,Guys...? Why are you all so quiet?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_7,Is this some kind of a joke?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_8,Oh come on!
Sub1_Ophelia_4_9,This isn't funny at all. Answer me!
Sub1_Ophelia_4_10,Elliciad! Vellekia! Carta! Panelity? Gigantes?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_11,Um... 
Sub1_Ophelia_4_12,...?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_13,I’m sorry...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_14,It’s my fault that my friends are gone.
Sub1_Ophelia_4_15,I should’ve kept an eye on them the entire time... It’s all my fault...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_16,Um... Well... If you’re okay with me... Can I offer you my help...?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_17,It’s alright...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_18,"Actually, can you tell me how to get out of here?"
Sub1_Ophelia_4_19,I need to find a way to get my friends back.
Sub1_Ophelia_4_20,Um... the inside of the World Tree is incredibly complex and can be quite dangerous..
Sub1_Ophelia_4_21,Uh... I think it’s best... if you go with me...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_22,So you were gathering tree sap from here?
Sub1_Ophelia_4_23,"Yes, the young leaves here have a special energy that invigorates the mind... "
Sub1_Ophelia_4_24,"And, uh, I need some inspiration... You see, um... I’m a writer..."
Sub1_Ophelia_4_25,"Oh wow, a writer! That’s wonderful!"
Sub1_Ophelia_4_26,"Hehe, I write romance novels. I’m a bit embarrassed about it though..."
Sub1_Ophelia_4_27,"Oh, I love romance novels too."
Sub1_Ophelia_4_28,Especially ‘Young Puppy Love No. 1’ by Wild Glasses!!
Sub1_Ophelia_4_29,"I mean the ending, it’s... Is it even possible for someone to come up with such a brilliant ending?"
Sub1_Ophelia_4_30,Ahaha... I guess you could say I’m... familiar with that author...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_31,"Um, so you mentioned that you’re an astrologer?"
Sub1_Ophelia_4_32,"Oh, yes! I read Tarot cards for people whom I encounter during the pilgrimage."
Sub1_Ophelia_4_33,My friends would get so excited every time a person came for a reading...
Sub1_Ophelia_4_34,Please do cheer up... Surely there must be a way.
Sub1_Ophelia_4_35,"Uh... If it’s not too much to ask, can you tell me more about yourself on the way...?"
Sub1_Ophelia_5_1,Oh wow... So you’re pursuing your destiny then...
Sub1_Ophelia_5_2,"Well, my destined one, to be exact."
Sub1_Ophelia_5_3,Huh..? You meant that kind of destiny?
Sub1_Ophelia_5_4,"I thought you were talking about something grand, like concerning the fate of this world or something like that..."
Sub1_Ophelia_5_5,"Heh, don’t you know that a girl’s love is more important than the fate of the world?"
Sub1_Ophelia_5_6,(On the road to find love...)
Sub1_Ophelia_5_7,(Perfect material for volume 2.)
Sub1_Ophelia_5_8,Ahaha... I see.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_9,But none of this matters if my friends aren’t with me.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_10,"Hmm... From the looks of it, your friends..."
Sub1_Ophelia_5_11,they sound like elementals...
Sub1_Ophelia_5_12,Elementals... It’s a bit more complicated than that.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_13,Only I can sense them.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_14,"Oh, come to think of it, you don’t look surprised at all. Even after all these... strange stuff."
Sub1_Ophelia_5_15,Most people think I’m joking or making things up.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_16,"Erm... well, I’m kind of similar to you. "
Sub1_Ophelia_5_17,I’m a gnome.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_18,Gnome...! So that’s why you have those ears...
Sub1_Ophelia_5_19,"Hehe, *blushes* yes, yes."
Sub1_Ophelia_5_20,"Um, I don’t think I’ve ever heard of friends like yours."
Sub1_Ophelia_5_21,Not even the books from the library had anything like this...
Sub1_Ophelia_5_22,Library?
Sub1_Ophelia_5_23,"Oh, did I not mention it earlier?"
Sub1_Ophelia_5_24,Being a writer is more of a side job. I’m the scribe for the Royal Great Library of Orvel.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_25,*Gasp* The scribe of the Royal Great Library of Orvel?
Sub1_Ophelia_5_26,The Royal Great Library that is said to contain every existing book ever?
Sub1_Ophelia_5_27,"Hehe, thanks to Princess Scarlet, that is. She’s quite the bookworm. "
Sub1_Ophelia_5_28,I heard the Royal Great Library of Orvel is basically the fountain of knowledge.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_29,I might be able to find a lead on how to get my friends back... 
Sub1_Ophelia_5_30,"Um, Leo, is it possible for me to tag along and visit the library with you?"
Sub1_Ophelia_5_31,There might be some information on how to bring my friends back.
Sub1_Ophelia_5_32,Excuse me? Err.. Um... We can’t just barge into the Royal Great Library...
Sub1_Ophelia_5_33,Ahaha... Maybe we can ask for permission then..
Sub1_Ophelia_5_34,(Yes!)
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_1,Wow... Everything is all so grand here...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_2,I'm so excited...!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_3,"I’ve been to the capital when I was on a tour with Stardust, but I've never actually visited the Royal Great Library!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_4,They say that this building was the very first to be built when they started constructing the castle.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_5,"Thanks to the forefathers who loved to read, now this place is vast beyond measure..."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_6,All sorts of rare books from all over the world are gathered here.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_7,"Even during the Demon War, I was here, guarding these books. "
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_8,(The Demon War? Just how old is he?)
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_9,Oh wow... A library this big may even
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_10,"have the books of my favorite author, Wild Glasses! "
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_11,Ahaha... perhaps...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_12,Leo.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_13,"Ah, Princess Scarlet. What a pleasant surprise to see you here. I, Scribe Leo, stand before Her Highness."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_14,"Oh! Witch Ophelia, also stands before Her Highness!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_15,Witch?
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_16,"(Oops, I probably shouldn't have said that in the castle.)"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_17,"Um... She’s harmless, Your Highness."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_18,"I met her outside during my stroll,"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_19,and she begged me to let her in to find a book... I just couldn’t refuse her request.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_20,"With your permission, perhaps I could allow her to see just the common literature, Your Highness...."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_21,I don’t think I’ve ever heard you speak so strongly.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_22,I trust anyone that you trust. 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_23,I hope you find the book that you’re looking for. 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_24,"Thank you very much, Your Highness!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_25,...I have something to discuss with you regarding father’s illness.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_26,I believe you may have an answer for it.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_27,I wonder if there's even a small possibility for him to get better...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_28,"There aren’t any books on getting my friends back, let alone a book about my friends..."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_29,So you haven’t found your book...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_30,Hmm... Or perhaps it’s in the restricted area...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_31,The restricted area?
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_32,Exceptionally rare books are separately managed in a restricted area...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_33,It’d be a tremendous loss to our country if any of those books are lost... 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_34,And those books aren’t like other books... they tend to...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_35,"Oh dear, forgive me and my babbling. Please forget what I just said!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_36,"No, no, thank you so much for telling me this!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_37,I’ll look in there!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_38,"I’m terribly sorry, but I really can’t let you in there..."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_39,"U-uh, farewell and take care..."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_40,I... I can’t give up now.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_41,"I grew up with them, spending every moment with them. They’re my family."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_42,I... I can’t just give up on them.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_43,Please. I beg you.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_44,"If there’s even a glimmer of hope, I’m willing to do anything."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_45,Entering the restricted area without permission is an extremely serious felony.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_46,Your Highness!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_47,However.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_48,Your words have moved me. I’ll make an exception.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_49,...I can’t give you much time though. 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_1,Creeeeepy... this feels nothing like the place before!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_2,"No. No, no. I’m not afraid at all!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_3,"Just keep tight, guys. I'm coming to save you all."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_4,Um... Please be careful... 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_5,Most of the books in the restricted area are affected by magical spells...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_6,And they have nasty tempers... They may attack you when they’re angry...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_7,"That's why it’s usually just me, the scribe, that comes and goes..."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_8,Books that attack people?!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_9,"Um, I’ll be careful!"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_2_10,Hmm... Where should I start...

Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_13,These books of the restricted area... have bewitched locks...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_14,This was done to prevent others without the set voice code of the original owner from reading the book. 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_15,That book... it will quiet down if we can enter the correct code!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_16,Voice code?
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_17,"I don’t know if it’s broken or something, but it seems to react only to you, Ophelia."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_18,"What? Um, then let's try..."

Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_49,[The Origin and Nature of All Existing Beings - Final Volume]
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_50,"[Plants, Animals, Spirits, Elementals...]"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_51,Oh my...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_52,The ancient runes of the book... are shifting into readable letters...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_53,This book... I think the author cast a special spell on this book...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_54,As if this book is only available for you...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_55,A book for me...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_56,I must read it now.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_57,"Ophelia, did you find anything on your friends?"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_58,"Umm, this is odd. I don’t think I can find it from the Elementals volume."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_59,Hmm?
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_60,Ah! Wait!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_61,((Others -
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_62,Most of these beings I mentioned earlier may be found through magical means.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_63,"However, according to The One, there are also funny creatures that are impossible to define."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_64,"If one had to pinpoint a category, they would be sorted as Elementals."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_65,But these beings born under the stars of destiny are 'metaphysical properties.'

Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_72,We can only feel them and be aware of their existence.))
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_73,"Ophelia, what exactly do you see?"
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_74,"Look, these little ones are circling around me."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_75,I can’t understand a single word you’re saying.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_76,B-but that’s so weird... I’m not lying...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_77,They even whisper their names to me.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_78,This is it. 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_79,It’s talking about my friends...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_80,Such... mystical and interesting information...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_81,"But Ophelia, I’m afraid this won’t help you much."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_82,Hmm... There isn’t any info on this 'The One.' It seems like this person is the author...
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_83,"Actually, it is pretty helpful."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_84,I know who I need to see now.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_85,Eh?
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_86,If I can’t find the writer... 
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_87,then the editor who wrote down these words must know almost as much about my friends!

Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_89,"B-but, this book was written really, really, really long time ago..."
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_90,Um... I’m quite sure that this person has already passed away.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_91,Hmm... I guess I can try to summon her spirit while gazing at the stars of the departed.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_92,Erm... It’s just that I haven’t heard about a witch named Eucaletus.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_93,Oh? There’s more writing underneath her name!
Sub1_Ophelia_6_4_94,(Awaiting the light at the altar of Galluah...)
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_1,The altar of Galluah can only mean that place...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_2,But rumor has it that place is...

Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_4,"No, even if it is, I must do anything to find a clue!"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_5,Let’s go to the altar!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_6,I can ask them the location of the grave.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_7,Eeek... It’s so creepy here.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_8,*BANG*
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_9,Huh?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_10,*BANG BANG! BANG! BANG!*
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_11,UGH! Filthy trash!

Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_13,"AAAAAAAHH!!! Dammit, who the hell are you?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_14,"Ah, it can be easy to get lost around here in Galluah because of the fog."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_15,(All the way out here to meet a dead person? She must be insane.)
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_16,Yo. I wouldn’t go there if I were you. Unless you have a death wish or something.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_17,My bullets just go straight past these suckers.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_18,"Ugh, where in the world did the old man go?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_19,Erm... What an odd person.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_20,I guess he’s a bit crazy.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_21,Ugh... It’s so cold here... 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_22,*Rustle* 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_23,Who dares awaken us?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_24,Eeek!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_25,I... I have something to ask you.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_26,"Since you all have watched over Galluah for the longest time, I-"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_27,"Are you mocking us, the ones that are not allowed to rest?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_28,"No, no! It’s the opposite! I need your help!"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_29,Please! Please tell me where the grave of Eucaletus is!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_30,Yess... It’s true that we know best what happens in the plains of Galluah...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_31,"Including that wretch who was burned at the stake over there, near the end of that altar."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_32,"Ahaha... So that’s where it is. Thank you so much. U-Uh, I’ll be leaving n-"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_33,Did you really think you could leave here alive?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_34,P-pardon?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_35,This realm is hell itself... you can only feel the eternal pain...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_36,"If you wish to enter the altar,\nthen share with us your flesh."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_37,We want rest... Grant us rest!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_38,N-no..!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_1,Never!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_2,"At this rate, I-"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_3,Ah! 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_4,This place! The altar of the undead...!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_5,What they truly need is...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_6,rest...

Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_8,"Your ardent plea has awakened me, the caller of death."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_9,"I am Carta, one who grants eternal rest."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_10,"I answer thy call, master."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_11,Ah... serenity at last...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_12,We give you our thanks...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_2_13,Carta... Thank you so much for coming back... Thank you so much!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_1,This is it.... I think this is the place.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_2,"If I meet this Eucaletus person,"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_3,I should be able to find a way to find the others!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_4,"O’ Asiphia, star of the dead, "
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_5,I wish to briefly speak with a spirit on your star through Carta. 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_6,Huh? Nothing's happening!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_7,"Master, Asiphia’s voice cannot reach the one you seek."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_8,The person you seek is not dead.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_9,Eh...? Not dead?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_10,...It appears that she’s neither dead nor alive.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_11,I shall open the path that leads to her.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_12,Ahh!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_13,That’s a lot of dust... *Cough cough* What is this place?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_14,*Cough cough*... Huh?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_15,"Wait, this is... a card."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_16,"So, another fool who seeks eternal life enters this realm... Ha ha ha."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_17,Ahh! You surprised me!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_18,Hello! Um... I’m here to see someone called Eucaletus...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_19,"Ha, someone that knows my name... Interesting."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_20,Ah! So you’re...?! 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_21,"Yes... It is I, Eucaletus.\nthe forgotten witch."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_22,"How does it feel to see someone who abandoned her physical body? Contemptible, aren't I?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_23,"N-not really, no."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_24,"Ha.. So, clearly you’re no ordinary being if you’ve made it this far..."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_25,What is it that you want from me?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_26,Uh... I have some questions on the book you worked on...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_27,I need your help to get my friends back!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_28,A book...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_29,"Please, tell me more about the one you wrote about the ones born under the stars of destiny."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_30,You... How did you get a hold of that book?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_31,Why do you ask?!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_32,Eh...?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_33,You... You!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_34,Y-yes?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_35,Name... Give me your name... YOUR NAME!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_36,"Um, I am Ophelia, the witch."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_37,F-finally... Finally!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_38,"Master, have you finally decided to forgive me?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_39,Huh? What are you talking about all of a sudden?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_40,I have awaited far too long.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_41,"I, Witch Eucaletus, greets the savior that will again engrave my very existence. "
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_42,"By meeting you, I will finally be forgiven."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_43,Thank you so much for letting me have my name recorded in history.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_44,Eh...?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_45,(What is going on…? Her tone completely changed all of a sudden...)
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_46,"Uh... I’m sorry, but I don’t really understand what’s happening here... Mind elaborating?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_47,"In the past, I was punished for trying to harm a precious star of my master."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_48,"When she delivered my punishment, she said that"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_49,"until my master's successor, a girl named ‘Ophelia' comes to me,"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_50,I will suffer this cycle of the torment of being neither dead nor alive.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_51,Unbelievable... Why would...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_52,"So, even though I accomplished many things along with my master, "
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_53,my feats were not recorded in the history of witches.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_54,I was once called the Great Witch of Wisdom but that glory is now all gone...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_55,...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_56,I did my best to lift the curse.  
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_57,Engraving the name of my master's comrades into the book was one of the efforts...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_58,Hoping that you will one day decipher the book's contents and find me...
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_59,Master? Just who exactly are you talking about?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_60,Is that ‘The One’ you wrote about in your book?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_61,I'm sure that the master is waiting for you.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_62,What... w-wait!!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_63,My friends have disappeared! Please tell me how to get them back! 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_64,I do not know. 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_65,I only wrote down what my master used to say.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_66,Your friends were also master’s closest friends.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_67,My friends were close with that person...?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_68,Did your master say anything else about my friends?!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_69,That’s all I know. 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_70,"If you wish to know more, why don’t you seek out the successor of Mira's will?"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_71,Mira?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_72,My master used to be close with Mira.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_73,She often spoke of her as well as her children.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_74,Ah...! Please don’t go!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_75,I still have questions!
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_76,Your trial has already begun. 
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_77,"Believe in yourself, and the path you lead. "
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_78,"For you are the noble successor that will hold the fate of this world in your eyes,"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_79,O’ savior.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_80,Ah... What in the world was she talking about...? She disappeared...
Sub1_Ophelia_8_1,"If Mira is the Mira from the month of love, from one of the constellations,"
Sub1_Ophelia_8_2,I should probably head to Elidora then...
Sub1_Ophelia_8_3,"Mira’s birthplace, and the forest that’s called the heaven of songs..."
Sub1_Ophelia_8_4,Hmm... The successor of the will of Mira...
Sub1_Ophelia_8_5,Oh! But who exactly is this Master person she kept talking about?...
Sub1_Ophelia_8_6,Hm... Or maybe! 
Sub1_Ophelia_8_7,Maybe it’s ‘The One’?
Sub1_Ophelia_8_8,"If that’s the case, I can’t wait!"
Sub1_Ophelia_8_9,Ah... Huh? You are..
Sub1_Ophelia_8_10,Huh? What the-
Sub1_Ophelia_8_11,Why do you keep following me?
Sub1_Ophelia_8_12,I never followed you.
Sub1_Ophelia_8_13,"Tsk, as if I need another chance encounter."
Sub1_Ophelia_8_14,I need to find that old geezer!
Sub1_Ophelia_8_15,There are no coincidences when it comes to meeting someone.
Sub1_Ophelia_8_16,There’s a reason for everything.
Sub1_Ophelia_8_17,Huh. I feel like I heard that from a gambling place before.
Sub1_Ophelia_8_18,It annoys me.
Sub1_Ophelia_8_19,Such a weird person.
Sub1_Ophelia_8_20,"Hey, wait. "
Sub1_Ophelia_8_21,"You said you’re a fortune teller, right?"
Sub1_Ophelia_8_22,Excuse me?
Sub1_Ophelia_9_1,"Don’t make me repeat myself. Ok, so there’s this guy with"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_2,"black hair, and a gun that looks like a huge bag!"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_3,??
Sub1_Ophelia_9_4,"Right, with a lollipop! He always has a lollipop in his mouth!"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_5,???????
Sub1_Ophelia_9_6,That’s what he looks like.
Sub1_Ophelia_9_7,Black hair... a gun that resembles a bag... and a lollipop... Hahaha...
Sub1_Ophelia_9_8,(I have no clue what he’s talking about!)
Sub1_Ophelia_9_9,"That’s good enough, right?"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_10,So! I need you to find a way to meet the old man. That’s what I’d like. 
Sub1_Ophelia_9_11,"Ah... Hahaha, you mean you want a Tarot reading on directions, right?"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_12,Yeah! That! I want that!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_13,What am I doing...
Sub1_Ophelia_9_14,*Sigh* I will begin the ritual. Please raise your head and look at me.
Sub1_Ophelia_9_15,"I, Witch Ophelia, will look into your eyes. "
Sub1_Ophelia_9_16,"O’ stars that shine this world, please light the path ahead."
Sub1_Ophelia_9_17,Now... please pick 3 cards.
Sub1_Ophelia_9_18,Come on.. do I really have to do something like this?
Sub1_Ophelia_9_19,"Ahaha... The first card you’ve picked is [The Fool] card, upright."
Sub1_Ophelia_9_20,"If you look at the bottom of the The Fool, there’s a white dog-"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_21,"Hey, let me pick another card."
Sub1_Ophelia_9_22,Wha- You can’t just touch them-
Sub1_Ophelia_9_23,Shaddup! Start over!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_24,[The Fool]
Sub1_Ophelia_9_25,Again!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_26,[The Fool]
Sub1_Ophelia_9_27,Again! Again! AGAIN!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_28,ARGH!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_29,Why am I getting the same card over and over again?!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_30,Why am I so unlucky these days!?
Sub1_Ophelia_9_31,Getting fake chips from a nutjob at the gambling area..\nAnd picking the worst cards...
Sub1_Ophelia_9_32,It’s not my fault that you’re unlucky...
Sub1_Ophelia_9_33,I better just find the old man myself. 
Sub1_Ophelia_9_34,Bye. 
Sub1_Ophelia_9_35,Hello...? You need to pay...!
Sub1_Ophelia_9_36,Ugh! I’m literally broke these days! 
Sub1_Ophelia_9_37,"Hey, this chip is all I have!"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_38,"Here, a fake chip for a phony reading! HAHA!"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_1,Such a weird person...
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_2,It’s been a while since I’ve had a rude customer like that...
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_3,I'm gonna tell Esker about this guy when I meet him!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_4,*Beehive falls off*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_5,Ah?!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_6,*Bzzzz*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_7,.............
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_8,*Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_9,Ee....Eeee.....
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_10,*BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_11,Wahhhhhhhhhhh!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_12,*BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_1_13,Just what is going on today!!!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_1,WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! Go away!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_2,Please! Somebody! Help!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_3,La la la la! La la!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_4,"Huh, who’s that?"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_5,"Hello, pretty young lady!"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_6,(@(*@(*&$@!$(*@-LP!!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_7,Maybe she didn’t hear me?
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_8,Hellooooooo?
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_9,H.E.L.P!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_10,Oh wow!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_11,Were you dancing with the bees?
Sub1_Ophelia_10_2_12,Lemme join you!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_1,*Pant*... *Pant*... Thank you... So... Much...
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_2,What a lovely dance party! 
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_3,*Talks*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_4,*Listens*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_5,... and that’s how I ended up here.
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_6,So kind-hearted! You came all the way here to find your friend...
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_7,*Humming*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_8,"Huh? Mr. Schute, Ophelia looks familiar to you?"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_9,Maybe you are imagining things. This is our very first meeting with Ophelia.
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_10,Huh? Our? Is there someone else here with you?
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_11,Oh! This is Mr. Schwanheite!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_12,Ah...haha... I... I see.
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_13,"Um...  Do you live here in Elidora, Shea?"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_14,"Umm, not exactly, "
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_15,but I’m promoting the ‘Ball of Shadows’ which will open tonight.
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_16,Oh wow... A midnight ball in the woods... 
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_17,That sounds fascinating!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_18,*Whispers*
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_19,"Wow! Mr. Schute, that’s a brilliant idea!"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_20,"Ophelia, won’t you be our special guest at the ball tonight?"
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_21,Eh...? Me?
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_22,"Yes! You see, Mr. Schute and I were wondering which song we should perform at the ball tonight."
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_23,A Song?
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_24,Yup! A song!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_25,The guests tonight have lost something dear to them.
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_26,So we’re looking for a song that will restore color to the shadows.
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_27,And I thought we can decide the song by your Tarot card reading!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_28,But I need to find my frien-
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_29,I know we’ll be able to find a happy melody with your help!
Sub1_Ophelia_10_3_30,Your friends are bound to come find you if they hear this song!
Sub1_Ophelia_11_1,There are too many songs in this world. I can’t pick!
Sub1_Ophelia_11_2,"Personally, I hope it’s a song like the [Green Nature’s Melody]."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_3,"No, no- Or maybe a song like the [Rising Dawn]!"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_4,I ended up inside the carriage without even noticing...
Sub1_Ophelia_11_5,"Erm... But it’s not like it feels wrong. It’s weird, but I can’t explain it."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_6,Actually... I even feel comfortable.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_7,I guess that’s thanks to her charm.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_8,And a ball in this lovely forest...
Sub1_Ophelia_11_9,That’s so romantic!
Sub1_Ophelia_11_10,"Oh, Ophelia!"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_11,How can I pay for the reading?
Sub1_Ophelia_11_12,Your beautiful singing will do.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_13,Oh wow! I’ll do my best!
Sub1_Ophelia_11_14,I’ll begin the ritual now.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_15,"I, Witch Ophelia, will look into your eyes."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_16,"O’ stars that shine this world, please light the path ahead."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_17,"Shea, please pick a card!"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_18,"Umm, Mr. Shute, you pick one too!"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_19,"The first card is card no. 24, The Wand, reversed."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_20,"This card features a boy collecting the stars above the sky into one place,"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_21,but inverted. It shows that there’s insatiable loneliness within you. 
Sub1_Ophelia_11_22,Hmm...
Sub1_Ophelia_11_23,"The second card is The Old Tree, upright."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_24,"If you look closely, there’s a man leaning against a tree, crying."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_25,It suggests that you are looking for support to soothe your loneliness.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_26,"And last but not least. The last card is The Shining Garden of the Night, upright."
Sub1_Ophelia_11_27,Now that’s a good card.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_28,It features light shining upon flowers that are dying due to lack of sunlight.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_29,It means that you will console the lonely somehow.
Sub1_Ophelia_11_30,"So in conclusion,"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_31,a song that comforts and heals...?
Sub1_Ophelia_11_32,Consolation...
Sub1_Ophelia_11_33,"Mr. Schute, you were thinking that song too?"
Sub1_Ophelia_11_34,Then I guess it’s finally time for that song!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_1,"Hello everyone, how did you enjoy tonight’s show?"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_2,"As the finale, I will be performing a special song, a song that’s never been performed before!"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_3,This is a special song selected through Ophelia’s cards.
Sub1_Ophelia_12_4,This song was made a very long time ago. The lyrics were written by a poet.
Sub1_Ophelia_12_5,A poet? 
Sub1_Ophelia_12_6,"Yep! Mr. Schute is one of the closest friends to Mira, the poet who sings of love."
Sub1_Ophelia_12_7,"Right, Mr. Schute?"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_8,*humming*
Sub1_Ophelia_12_9,Mira!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_10,Mira sometimes visits those concerts in my dreams as well.
Sub1_Ophelia_12_11,"She compliments me saying that of the children born in the month of love, I resemble her the most."
Sub1_Ophelia_12_12,The successor of Mira's will...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_13,Could it be...?
Sub1_Ophelia_12_14,"Now, ladies and gentle-shadows, "
Sub1_Ophelia_12_15,I hope this song brings warmth to your hearts!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_16,"The girl wakes up from a long dream, and holds the small one in her hand close to her heart."
Sub1_Ophelia_12_17,"Its heart was cold as ice,"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_18,"so she held the heart so tight, stopping it from turning to ice."
Sub1_Ophelia_12_19,"Just a spoonful of warmth to loneliness, that will do-"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_20,"Ah~ The light shines into a heart dark as the shadow, oh-"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_21,This familiar longing...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_22,I feel like tearing up...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_23,Ah... Ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_24,This is... the story of that time when I first met her!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_25,Did everyone enjoy the song?
Sub1_Ophelia_12_26,Ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_27,Mira always used to tell Mr. Schute that
Sub1_Ophelia_12_28,"that her dear friend asked her to play this song,"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_29,"saying when the time is right one day, he should play this song."
Sub1_Ophelia_12_30,I’m so happy that I finally get to play this song!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_31,Ah... Ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_32,"To constantly heal and comfort the numerous scars of this world,"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_33,"the title of this song is, "
Sub1_Ophelia_12_34,Elliciad...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_35,*humming*
Sub1_Ophelia_12_36,*humming*
Sub1_Ophelia_12_37,Huh? This song has not been released yet...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_38,"Waaaah, Ophelia I missed you so much!"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_39,I’ve been waiting for you for so long! Never leave me again!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_40,Huh? Look at all these friends who lost love!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_41,Just give me a moment! I will return your light!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_42,Wow! The colors of the shadows have returned!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_43,"Oh, Mr. Schute, did you say that someone is here?"
Sub1_Ophelia_12_44,Hellooo!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_45,I’m sorry... and thank you... Elliciad. 
Sub1_Ophelia_12_46,Huh?
Sub1_Ophelia_12_47,What... What is this feeling...
Sub1_Ophelia_12_48,Ah!
Sub1_Ophelia_12_49,Huh? Ophelia?
Sub1_Ophelia_12_50,Where did she go?
Sub1_Ophelia_12_51,Mr. Schute! Don’t just keep the information to yourself! Share it with me as well!
Sub1_Ophelia_13_1,Ah... My head hurts... 
Sub1_Ophelia_13_2,This place is... 
Sub1_Ophelia_13_3,I see that you’ve met Eucaletus and Schwanheite.
Sub1_Ophelia_13_4,W-who are you...?
Sub1_Ophelia_13_5,I’ve been waiting for you. 
Sub1_Ophelia_13_6,You! That voice..! From the World Tree..!
Sub1_Ophelia_13_7,It’s you!
Sub1_Ophelia_13_8,"The master of Eucaletus, a friend of Mira... They’re all you!"
Sub1_Ophelia_13_9,Yes. And it is also I who put your friends to sleep. Fufu...
Sub1_Ophelia_13_10,W-why do you look like me?
Sub1_Ophelia_13_11,"Because if you look at my actual appearance, you might pass out from the shock? Fufu..."
Sub1_Ophelia_13_12,I have much to talk about with you.
Sub1_Ophelia_13_13,Let's go for a walk.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_1,I’ve been looking forward to meeting you for a very long time.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_2,"I waited, and waited..."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_3,I even manifested my will to
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_4,That magic circle back then... So it was...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_5,Yes... 
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_6,But it was impossible for me to maintain that conjuration until your birth.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_7,I only had one chance.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_8,I used the energy of insight formed by the gathering starlight to form that magic circle.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_9,The World Tree... Stars of the Prophecy... Insight...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_10,Everything makes sense now...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_11,You are... the very root of astrology...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_12,You are...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_13,Lasiphil the Prophet.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_14,...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_15,Why? Why do you want to meet me that much...?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_16,I just don’t understand... Why would you...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_17,I’m just an ordinary witch.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_18,"No, you’re special, little one. "
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_19,"Before I took the form of the stars and disappeared, I saw you in my dreams."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_20,"I saw a girl named Ophelia, dancing with my children, laughing..."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_21,And then I realized that
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_22,you are my successor and that you can witness the fate of this world.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_23,The fate of this world...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_24,"As the chosen one can foresee the future ahead,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_25,it is a great blessing to be chosen by the children from the stars of destiny.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_26,"But it can be quite daunting, exhausting to know what lies ahead for this world."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_27,I know this all too well.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_28,That’s why I had to test whether you can withstand this burden or not.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_29,So... That's why my friends were...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_30,The children of destiny were designed to wake from their slumber once their worth was revealed.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_31,"As expected, your path was truly amazing."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_32,"However... Even if you have become the true master of death and love,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_33,That is not enough.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_34,There is another child that determines fate through their very life.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_35,"Fufu, you know who it is, don’t you?"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_36,Fortune...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_37,Yes. You were unable to wake Vellekia.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_38,Ah... ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_39,"I’ve been waiting for a while now,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_40,but I’m afraid you don’t have much time now.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_41,"Since I knew you have failed,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_42,I called you here so that you can say goodbye to your friends.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_43,Did you just say goodbye...?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_44,Ah... No... No...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_45,I won’t let an unworthy master fool around with the fate of others.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_46,It’s better to put the children to sleep forever for the sake of protecting this world.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_47,No!!!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_48,"Please, give me my friends back!"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_1,Cards... Fufu...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_2,I see that you've been carrying them in interesting forms.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_3,Why... Why...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_4,Who...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_5,do you think is the first chosen of the stars of destiny?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_6,"Ophelia, you do not stand a chance against me."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_7,No... NO!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_8,My friends... Please! Please wake up!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_9,Come back to me... 
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_10,Please!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_1,Time to say farewell.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_2,"Destruction, I call upon thee. Come to me, Gigantes."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_3,No!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_4,Please...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_5,Please don’t hurt my friends...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_6,Please.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_7,One cannot go against their fate.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_8,"As a human, you must follow your fate’s course."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_9,"Since you were unable to save them, the children must sleep. "
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_10,No...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_11,"I can’t do that, and I won’t let you!"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_12,I will never part with my friends.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_13,If your so-called fate is me parting with my friends...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_14,Then...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_15,"I, Ophelia!"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_16,Will go against that fate!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_17,That’s... a coin on the wheel?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_18,Unbelievable...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_19,It seems the wheel of fortune has changed its course.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_20,"Thank you, Ophelia..."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_21,The power to change the approaching future at once. 
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_22,The power of miracles. Fortune holds the power of miracles.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_3_23,Your stong will to change your fate finally woke me.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_1,Vellekia! Thank you so much for coming back!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_2,And everyone else... I missed you so much...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_3,I’m sorry... I’m so sorry I couldn’t find you all sooner.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_4,"Ophelia, my dear girl who became my last dream..."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_5,"Yes, for it is I, Lasiphil. "
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_6,The observer of fates. 
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_7,I knew it... You really are Lasiphil.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_8,My dreams were right.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_9,"Ophelia, you are ready to lead the fate of this world."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_10,You were specially chosen by
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_11,"Death, Love, and Fortune - all intervening properties of every fate."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_12,All logic and emotions derived from these three will now follow your command.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_13,"Happiness, laughter, destruction, sadness, and all..."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_14,But...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_15,I’m here to save my friends.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_16,"And the fate I’m looking for isn’t the fate of the world,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_17,"but rather, I search for my destined, one who visits me in dreams."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_18,"Ophelia,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_19,look closer within your heart.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_20,Those two are not different.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_21,What?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_22,Ah... Oh... 
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_23,I see...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_24,Ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_25,That’s...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_26,That's why... In my dreams...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_27,That's why my friends would...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_28,Ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_29,Ahh...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_30,I get it now.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_31,Now I understand my role.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_32,"I am you, and you are me. "
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_33,The destiny of this world which we've been guiding from the past...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_34,It is now time to see it through your eyes.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_35,Ophelia.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_36,Now you are 
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_37,the Pathfinder of Fate.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_38,Let us walk this road together.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_39,Pathfinder... of Fate...
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_1,Ah...! 
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_2,I must thank the Princess!
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_3,............
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_4,Prin-
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_5,Do not disturb Her Highness.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_6,"Ah! Forgive me, I spoke out of turn."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_7,That's alright.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_8,...The sky is filled with stars tonight.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_9,"Yes, it seems that the sky is clear tonight. I can see the stars."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_10,Ah! The blue star lights have started to gather.\nIt must be time for the Asiphia Constellation to show.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_11,I should pray now.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_12,Pray?
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_13,Yes. The shape of those stars means that the dead spirits are about to reach Empress Asiphia’s star.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_14,"My prayers are for the deceased, hoping that they would get the eternal rest they deserve."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_15,You seem to know your stars.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_16,You mentioned that you are a witch.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_17,"Yes, Your Highness! I am also an astrologer."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_18,It seems that there are many interesting trades outside the castle. 
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_19,...........Are the subjects of that star loyal to their liege?
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_20,"Pardon, Your Highness?"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_21,Just forget about what I just said.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_22,"If you’re an astrologer, can you tell me my fortune then?"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_23,"Oh.. Your Highness, h-how could someone like me.."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_24,It's okay. Lead the way.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_25,"Forgive me, Your Highness. My establishment is old and rusty..."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_26,"No, this is fine. This carriage is... intriguing."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_27,I should perhaps get myself a carriage like this.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_28,"Um, the gentleman over there..."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_29,"Ah, do not mind him."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_30,"Now Your Highness, what kind of divination would you like me to proceed with?"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_31,What are my options?
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_32,There are a few.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_33,"For example, there's a reading I can do to see the direction of your future."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_34,Hmm? What’s wrong?
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_35,"No, it’s nothing!"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_36,"Or if you have trouble choosing,\nI can give you a reading on the past, present, and future."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_37,Interesting. I’d like that.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_38,"Um... Please forgive me for my discourtesy, but I will gaze into your eyes for the ritual. It will not take long."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_39,Go ahead. 
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_40,"Then I shall gaze into your eyes, Your Highness, the Faith of Silver... Forgive me for this."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_41,"O’ stars that shine this world, please light the path ahead."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_42,"Princess, please pick 3 cards."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_43,Hmm... 
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_44,"The first card is the man standing straight with his sword, upright. "
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_45,"If you look at this card, even with a bunch of snakes near him,\nthe knight stands undaunted. "
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_46,"As a figure of sharp intellect,"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_47,you did not let go of the sword and made logical decisions even in the face of danger.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_48,...
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_49,"The second card is a girl sitting in the meadows, reversed."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_50,"The girl is looking for flowers, but there aren’t exactly a lot of flowers around her."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_51,"Hmm... Your Highness, you are confused internally amidst these difficult hours."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_52,Perhaps you need an advisor that will listen to your words closely.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_53,An advisor...
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_54,And the last card is...
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_55,Your Highness! The Royal Gatekeeper Sir Loman has an urgent message!
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_56,An underground labyrinth has been discovered underneath the Castle!
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_57,Your presence is requested immediately for this urgent issue!
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_58,What?
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_59,"Ophelia, I apologize for leaving so abruptly."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_60,I’ll see you another time if fate lets us.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_61,Ah...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_1,I never thought I could see a beautiful scene like this...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_2,"As an astrologer, this is such a blessing."
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_3,[*People Chattering*]
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_4,Wow... So many people...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_5,"It’s so late at night, yet everyone came here to celebrate this day..."
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_6,Hmm... I need to give my pilgrim’s prayer in front of the World Tree...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_7,I should hurry my way through the crowd.
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_8,Let’s cherish this night in our hearts
Sub1_Ophelia_3_5_Plus_9,by paying our respects to the holy ground.
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13_Plus_1,Vellekia!!!
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13_Plus_2,Where are you?! Answer me!
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13_Plus_3,This is strange... I’m sure we were going deeper into the World Tree..
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13_Plus_4,It's gotten so dark...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13_Plus_5,Where exactly... am I?
Sub1_Ophelia_3_13_Plus_6,Vellekia must be so scared alone...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_15_Plus_1,Vellekia?
Sub1_Ophelia_3_15_Plus_2,Vellekia!! I’m so glad that you're al-
Sub1_Ophelia_3_15_Plus_3,This is...
Sub1_Ophelia_3_15_Plus_4,a magic circle?
Sub1_Ophelia_5_7_Plus_1,Kekeke.
Sub1_Ophelia_Laugh_1,Hahaha....
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_27_Plus_1,I’m coming to save you all.
Sub1_Ophelia_6_1_27_Plus_2,Please hold on... My precious friends.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_3_Plus_1,"If Esker was here, he would've advised me on what I need to do exactly..."
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_3_Plus_2,Esker... Why are you not here when I need you the most?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_1_3_Plus_3,Where are you?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_3_Plus_1,enchant the holy ground with a conjuration.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_4_Plus_1,That voice!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_6_Plus_1,It was too much even for me.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_1_7_Plus_1,"On the day the stars crossed each other’s path,"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_33_Plus_1,"And I can also see into one’s academics, wealth, and romance- Ah..."
Sub1_Ophelia_3_2_Plus_1,may chime louder tonight.
Sub1_Ophelia_3_3_Plus_1,the stars of the prophecy cross each other’s path for the first time tonight.
Sub1_Ophelia_4_1_1,"(Hmm... Since my friends aren't here, I guess I have to use my regular cards that I have right now.)"
Sub1_Ophelia_4_1_2,(They may look the same... But their strength is totally different.)
Sub1_Ophelia_4_1_3,(But... I can't cause any trouble! I'll inject my magic into the cards as much as possible!)
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_0_Plus_1,Carta... Don't you remember anything from before...?
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_0_Plus_2,*Sigh* I have no other choice but to meet her.
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_1_Plus_1,"Since I found the home of the dead, I should be able to summon a soul through a ritual!"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_10_Plus_1,"I analyzed her traces,"
Sub1_Ophelia_7_3_10_Plus_2,and I sense unknown coordinates that are of the same energy.
Sub1_Ophelia_9_13_Plus_1,"(Ah... Since I don't have my friends with me, I have to use my emergency cards...)"
Sub1_Ophelia_9_13_Plus_2,"(They may not be precise like my friends, but still...)"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_2_6_Plus_1,Their sight and hearing are impaired. They'll never recognize you.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_21_Plus_1,The destined one from your dream...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_21_Plus_2,Is the fate...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_21_Plus_3,of this world...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_29_Plus_1,Ahh... Was everything already within my world to begin with?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_29_Plus_2,The fate of this world... The one to save this world...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_40,Have you ever heard the whispers of a star?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_41,"If you listen closely to their shining voices that fill the night sky,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_42,you can dream the most exquisite dream that night.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_43,"If you walk along with the whispers,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_44,you may meet a stranger that makes your heart flutter.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_45,Did you know?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_46,Your eyes hold the path of the stars as well.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_47,"The bright, shining path led by stars."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_48,"If you follow that path,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_49,you will reach what your heart desires the most.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_50,Now I will gaze into your eyes.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_51,I am the foreseer of fate.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_52,The pathfinder who guides through lost paths.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_53,I am who defies fate.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_54,I am the navigator of directions to lost paths.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_55,"To meet the fate that is you,"
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_56,"I have followed this path, carrying the whispers of starlight."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_57,"I am, witch Ophelia."
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_58,After some time...
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_59,Mmhm~ hm~
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_60,I see that the stars of insight are all safely connected. I'm glad.
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_61,Huh... Eh... Ah?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_62,That... Eye!
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_63,How can you be here?
Sub1_Ophelia_14_4_64,"I've been waiting to meet you, O' new Lasiphil."
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_62,"The wheel of fortune heads toward the obsidian sea,"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_63,and the stars drifting through eternity gather around together.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_64,"The collected starlight is the lighthouse shining this eternal night,"
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_65,the tide that will stand against the upcoming giant tide.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_66,May the twelve rising stars shine their light bright.
Sub1_Ophelia_Sub_Sca_67,Be the ray of light that will shine through this deep darkness.
