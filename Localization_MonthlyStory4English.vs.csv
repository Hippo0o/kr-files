E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_01,…
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_02,Maria... isn't here today.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_03,"Ah, I guess it's that day again..."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_04,That means... she must be there...
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_05,At his grave...
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_06,It was like walking through a thick fog of blood.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_07,There was no reason to think.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_08,There was no need to think.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_09,All I needed was someone to fight. That was enough.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_10,The Dark Lord had ordered me to hunt down the dragons and decimate the Earth.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_11,"And so, I devoured countless dragons and absorbed their powers."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_12,The bloodthirsty Draconics Army continued to grow in strength.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_13,"But during the final battle against the warrior and his party, I..."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_14,...Hm? Why are you just standing there?
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_15,"...!? Maria, I thought you went to visit Oricana's grave..."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_16,"I already did, just like I've done for the past 100 years..."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_17,…
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_18,"Can I ask you a question, Maria?"
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_19,Hm?
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_20,...Do you not... despise me?
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_21,For killing the one... who was considered as your other half...
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_22,…
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_23,*Sigh* Didn't we already talk about this?
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_24,"...Of course, I did hate your guts once."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_25,But... you are also the last memento left behind by him.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_26,Besides... You're not that person anymore.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_27,You've changed too much... for me to ask of you to take responsibility for your past sins.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_28,…
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_29,Becoming unshackled from the Dark Lord... and the awakening of my true nature...
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_30,It was the last gift... left behind by Oricana.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_31,Even though our journey started off from resentment and curses...
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_32,Things have changed now.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_33,Oricana may be gone... but now I have you.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_34,Which is why the day he left... has technically become your birthday.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_35,"Well, maybe that kind of human tradition is kind of meaningless..."
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_36,I'm sorry... for not taking care of you until now.
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_37,…
E_C19_Apr_Morrah09_38,Thank you... Maria.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_01,"Hmm, let's try mixing a bit of this... and next..."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_02,"Ha ha, the new medicine is close to completion..."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_03,"Ah, I just can't wait to test it out already..."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_04,…
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_05,Ahem.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_06,Happy birthday!
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_07,?!
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_08,Huh? When did you get here?
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_09,What are you talking about? Birthday...?
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_10,Is it already that time of the year?
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_11,"Hahaha, did you forget about your birthday again because of your research?"
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_12,"Well, this isn't the first time you've done that, ha ha..."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_13,"You disappeared last year in search of some herbs, so we didn't even have a proper celebration."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_14,That's why I suggested we have a big party this year if we have the chance!
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_15,"Heh heh, and we obviously have some presents for you!"
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_16,Ta-da!
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_17,"Oh, wow… this is.."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_18,Are you sure about giving me something so valuable...?
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_19,"Of course, it may be rare, but merchants have a knack for finding stuff like this!"
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_20,I'll be able to get some more later.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_21,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_22,"Although I don't have any... poison for your research, Mediana..."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_23,I made some cake since it's your birthday after all.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_24,"Oh, what a nice cake."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_25,"Thank you, both of you."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_26,You remembered my birthday while I completely forgot...
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_27,Heh heh...
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_28,Whoa!
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_29,...? Is that...?
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_30,"*Whew* Sorry, my bad."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_31,I had a hard time bringing this in because it's so heavy.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_32,"Wow, that's a huge monster..."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_33,"Ah, yeah. It's a monster called Giant Hellhound that lives near the volcano."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_34,It's notorious for being really tough and vicious.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_35,"Oh... So, why did you bring this monster?"
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_36,"Ah, this is a demonic beast that crossed over from Pandemonium."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_37,I remember something about Mediana wanting to test her medicines on demons or demonic beasts...
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_38,"And it's her birthday too, right?"
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_39,I just couldn't come here empty-handed.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_40,…
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_41,"Hahaha... Thank you, everyone."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_42,Thank you for the best birthday presents I've ever received.
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_43,Well then... Shall we start the experiment?
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_44,"Oh, I can't wait to see Mediana's experiment in person!"
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_45,"Hahaha, I can't help but always think that... Mediana really loves her research."
E_C19_Apr_Mediana07_46,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_01,"Oh, Cleo! What kind of errand is it this time!?"
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_02,I was wondering why she was so quiet today.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_03,Well... I suppose it was the same during the birthdays from before...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_04,Five years ago
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_05,Target confirmed. Currently approaching the central plaza.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_06,We're approaching the target now. Are you ready?
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_07,H-hold on. My heels... Ugh...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_08,...Change of plans. I am approaching the target.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_09,I told you to wait. I won't lose him this time!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_10,Shhh! Don't yell that out here...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_11,"Oh, dear... Looks like the husband is running away."
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_12,How terrible... Leaving behind his young wife like that...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_13,...*Sigh*
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_14,...Let's pull back for now.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_15,Three years ago
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_16,This 44th bomb!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_17,"...So, why did you call me out today?"
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_18,Happy birthday!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_19,You're... celebrating my birthday by fighting these monsters?
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_20,Right! See my new bomb power!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_21,Super! Cool!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_22,...I never want this sort of celebration ever again.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_23,One year ago
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_24,I knew... this day would come sooner or later...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_25,Doing part-time work to get money for food...
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_26,"Why are you dragging your heels like that, Roi!?"
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_27,We have to finish quickly to earn our bonus!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_28,...*Sigh* How did I end up like this...?
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_29,I guess... Having to run an errand for Cleo sounds typical for my birthday.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_30,Hm... This must be it. I just have to pick up that Flame Scroll from here?
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_31,Where's the contact?
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_32,Oh! That rear of yours is as perfect as I remember!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_33,...This voice. Are you the contact?
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_34,Of course! Roi! I myself have personally brought this rare scroll that can't be found anywhere in the Empire these days!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_35,"Thank you. Farewell, then."
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_36,Hold on! I still have some unfinished business!
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_37,This is the end of my job. You can deal that with Cleo.
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_38,"Aww, but my business is with you! Cleo told me to have fun with you!"
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_39,"Let's have a great time together today, Roi!"
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_40,"...Is that so? Fine. I'll take care of you first. Then, Cleo."
E_C19_Apr_Roi01_41,This birthday... isn't going to be any easier.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_01,*Yawn*... A great start to a new day... Huh?
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_02,"Good morning, Master."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_03,"Oh, good morning, Kara. What's with those clothes?"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_04,Today is Master's birthday.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_05,Birthday. The day of a person's birth. The day to give presents to celebrate the happiness of the said person.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_06,"My present today for you Master, is to do my best in assisting your research for the day."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_07,"Wow!!!!!! Thanks, Kara."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_08,But doing your best to assist my research? That's a strange resulting value for a present.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_09,"Kara, could you show me the research data on birthday presents?"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_10,"Yes, Master. Displaying the data."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_11,Birthday present? ...Don't you just give what the person likes the best?
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_12,"What I want as a present? Princess, Demia, Clause... There's just so many."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_13,Birthday present... Handmade presents are the best.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_14,"How about this wooden doll? Or I could engrave a lion, the royal symbol and..."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_15,The further conversation was deleted since his explanation continued for 30 minutes.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_16,Birthday present? It obviously should be a top-quality silvervine!
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_17,"I mean what kind of a cat wouldn't like that? Oh, this is a gift for a human?"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_18,Birthday present? There's no need for things like that. Just be happy every day. Idiots!
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_19,By the way... You! You look pretty strong. How about some duel with me?
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_20,"Hm, I'm honored to have such a beautiful girl come talk to me."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_21,A birthday present... Wouldn't it be best to give something the person likes the most?
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_22,"It's money? Ha ha... Then, why don't you leave it to me?"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_23,I can double the amount at least! Can you wait a little bit?
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_24,"I waited until midnight afterward, but had to return to the castle as he did not come back."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_25,That is all.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_26,Ahhhh! What is wrong with those samples!?
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_27,"I'm sorry, Kara... I'll reset your AI."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_28,Birthday present. Giving what the person likes the best to make them happy.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_29,But I do not have any money.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_30,"That is why I am going to assist Master in his research to the best of my ability. Research is what you like the best, along with money."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_31,"I hope you will be happy with this present, Master."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_32,"Ha ha... Your offer is a bit strange, but I'm still delighted."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_33,"And I'm already happy! It's more than enough to know that you care about my happiness, Kara!"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_34,Heart. But I have not done any service yet.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_35,"No, Kara, your caring heart is more than enough!"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_36,Heart. Matters of the heart are always difficult.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_37,"It's okay, you're slowly learning about it!"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_38,"Then, here is the most important message."
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_39,"Master, happy birthday!"
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_40,I hope you have a great day.
E_C19_Apr_Annette01_41,"Yep! Thanks, Kara!"
E_C19_April_Theo_01,"Shining brightest, even amongst those colorful flowers that were trying to stand out,"
E_C19_April_Theo_02,the slight blush on your cheeks as you gazed into my eyes
E_C19_April_Theo_03,was what captured my heart that day.
E_C19_April_Theo_04,"Theo, happy birthday."
E_C19_April_Theo_05,......
E_C19_April_Theo_06,What are you doing?
E_C19_April_Theo_07,...A flower?
E_C19_April_Theo_08,"Ah, you're going to give it to your lady?"
E_C19_April_Theo_09,...That sounds good.
E_C19_April_Theo_10,"Then, what are you waiting for? Go on and give it to her."
E_C19_April_Theo_11,Well...
E_C19_April_Theo_12,It's the same flower I received on my last birthday.
E_C19_April_Theo_13,I see. I wouldn't know since I've never gotten anything like that...
E_C19_April_Theo_14,"...Oh, wait."
E_C19_April_Theo_15,"When's your birthday? Since this flower blooms around this time of the year, shouldn't it be soon?"
E_C19_April_Theo_16,That's right... it's today.
E_C19_April_Theo_17,......
E_C19_April_Theo_18,What is it?
E_C19_April_Theo_19,What do you mean?
E_C19_April_Theo_20,Why are you telling us that now!?
E_C19_April_Theo_21,"Jane, did you hear that? It's Mr. Handsome's birthday today!"
E_C19_April_Theo_22,Did you know?
E_C19_April_Theo_23,"...No, I don't remember."
E_C19_April_Theo_24,"Hm, since he's always working hard to protect you, shouldn't you prepare a present or something?"
E_C19_April_Theo_25,A present...?
E_C19_April_Theo_26,"Wait, we don't have time to waste."
E_C19_April_Theo_27,"We're going to camp here for the night, right? I'll be right back!"
E_C19_April_Theo_28,Right now?
E_C19_April_Theo_29,"What? You're going to give something to Mr. Handsome, Half Breed?"
E_C19_April_Theo_30,What are you getting for him?
E_C19_April_Theo_31,I'm not telling you!
E_C19_April_Theo_32,"Ahaha, come on, don't be shy!"
E_C19_April_Theo_33,(The ex-lover and the best friend are working together for the same purpose?)
E_C19_April_Theo_34,This is going to be fun.
E_C19_April_Theo_35,Fun? We're just getting some birthday presents.
E_C19_April_Theo_36,"Ahaha, you really don't know anything, Half-breed. This is going to be really fun."
E_C19_April_Theo_37,"Well, I'm pretty sure how Mr. Handsome is going to react, but you never know."
E_C19_April_Theo_38,I have no idea what you're talking about.
E_C19_April_Theo_39,Let's see... The Princess and the Half Breed. Which one should I follow?
E_C19_April_Theo_40,......
E_C19_April_Theo_41,I knew I should have followed the Half Breed!
E_C19_April_Theo_42,"Hey, Mr. Handsome! Look at what this Half Breed made!"
E_C19_April_Theo_43,Hey! D-don't tell him!
E_C19_April_Theo_44,...?
E_C19_April_Theo_45,...It's nothing big. Happy birthday. Open it later.
E_C19_April_Theo_46,Thank you.
E_C19_April_Theo_47,...It this... a talisman?
E_C19_April_Theo_48,I told you to open it later... *Sigh*
E_C19_April_Theo_49,It's... just something you can't get from this area.
E_C19_April_Theo_50,"I was going to make a pouch for it, but Succubus told me that wasn't necessary."
E_C19_April_Theo_51,"That's right! If you do that, it wouldn't be fair for the Princess!"
E_C19_April_Theo_52,...?
E_C19_April_Theo_53,"Which means, it's time for the Princess to give a present!"
E_C19_April_Theo_54,...
E_C19_April_Theo_55,"...Theo, happy birthday."
E_C19_April_Theo_56,"At that moment,"
E_C19_April_Theo_57,the wind carrying the scent of that day started blowing again.
E_C19_April_Theo_58,"Thank you, my Lady."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_01,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here today."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_02,"Today is the 15th birthday of Lady Jane, the glory of the Republic of Gray."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_03,"Please, give her a round of applause!"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_04,"My lady, happy birthday! Every year, you grow even more gorgeous!"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_05,My lady! Congratulations! May you be happy now and forevermore!
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_06,Jane! Happy Birthday! See you at the ball later!
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_07,"Lady Jane, I came from the eastern continent, just to see you."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_08,"Hey! Get in line! Princess, happy birthday!"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_09,"Our manor was safe during the last monster conquest, thanks to the Lady and Knight of Loyalty."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_10,"Our family hereby pledges allegiance to you, my Lady."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_11,I am so flattered. I merely did what needed to be done.
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_12,"Thank you, all of you, for gathering here to celebrate my birthday."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_13,"We will begin the ball soon. Everyone, please enjoy yourselves!"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_14,"Lady, would you give me the honor of the first dance with you?"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_15,"Wait a second! I crossed the continent to dance with the Lady here. My lady, please dance with me!"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_16,"I apologize, gentlemen, but I've already promised my first dance to someone else."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_17,Jane! Are you not dancing? The next song is your favorite waltz!
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_18,"Speaking of which, the ball is somewhat empty today! Hasn't the Knight of Loyalty returned from the conquest yet?"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_19,He will be here soon. That man keeps his word.
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_20,................ *Ding* *Dang*
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_21,"Theo, you don't need to rush."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_22,"My apologies, my Lady. I should not be late on this important occasion."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_23,"Haha, don't be. The day is not over yet."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_24,"Happy birthday, my Lady."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_25,"Thank you, Theo. And where is my present?"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_26,"Oh, that is... I hurried here as quickly as I could. I am sorry, my Lady..."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_27,"No, Theo. All I want is just one thing."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_28,Please be my first dance partner at my birthday ball.
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_29,Come on! Hurry!
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_30,"That would be my honor, my Lady."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_31,Huh? Look at Theo. Why is he smiling in his sleep?
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_32,Shush! I'm concentrating now!
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_33,I tried so hard to look into this happy dream of these two from a hundred years ago...
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_34,"Phew, this is taking a lot out of me. I don't have the strength to even talk about it."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_35,"Wow! You can actually do that? No wonder, you are a succubus."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_36,You would be so impressed if you knew how much Mana this consumes!
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_37,"Well, today is Jane's birthday, so this is the least I can do."
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_38,"I don't know what will happen later,"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_39,"but enjoy your sweet dreams, the two of you!"
E_C19_Apr_Jane01_40,"Happy birthday, Jane!"
