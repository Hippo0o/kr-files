E_C19_May_Lucias_01,"Did you need me, Sir Ricardo?"
E_C19_May_Lucias_02,"You seem to leave your spot pretty often these days."
E_C19_May_Lucias_03,"The recent battle with demons had a lot of civilian casualties, along with the holy warriors."
E_C19_May_Lucias_04,"I was delayed while attending to those who were in need. I apologize."
E_C19_May_Lucias_05,"Hahaha! There's no need to apologize!"
E_C19_May_Lucias_06,"I already know that you can't ignore anyone in need of help."
E_C19_May_Lucias_07,"By the way, Lucias, I found out it's your birthday today!"
E_C19_May_Lucias_08,"I would have prepared a celebration earlier,"
E_C19_May_Lucias_09,"but I tend to forget about these events as I grow older, hahaha!"
E_C19_May_Lucias_10,"I'm sorry I'm kind of late."
E_C19_May_Lucias_11,"It's not much, but here's a little something for you."
E_C19_May_Lucias_12,"Thank you."
E_C19_May_Lucias_13,"...But how did you know that today is my birthday?"
E_C19_May_Lucias_14,"A letter from the Magician of Stardust arrived for me today."
E_C19_May_Lucias_15,"He must be a friend of yours if he remembered your birthday. What an interesting friend you have."
E_C19_May_Lucias_16,"Ha ha... yeah... I suppose so."
E_C19_May_Lucias_17,"By the way, do you ever visit your hometown?"
E_C19_May_Lucias_18,"No, I've never had the chance."
E_C19_May_Lucias_19,"All parents tend to long for their children once they leave on their own."
E_C19_May_Lucias_20,"They always worry about the health and the safety of their children."
E_C19_May_Lucias_21,"That in turn makes them stay awake at night."
E_C19_May_Lucias_22,"And today happens to be an important day for you."
E_C19_May_Lucias_23,"Why don't you take a breather and visit your hometown?"
E_C19_May_Lucias_24,"Lucias, take these to your parents."
E_C19_May_Lucias_25,"Thank you for always sharing the crops."
E_C19_May_Lucias_26,"Ha ha ha, there's no need to thank me. You're the one who's keeping this village safe."
E_C19_May_Lucias_27,"I'm always grateful to the Goddess."
E_C19_May_Lucias_28,"After all, she has sent us a blessed child like you to our side..."
E_C19_May_Lucias_29,"I'm embarrassed to hear that from everyone..."
E_C19_May_Lucias_30,"Outside of this village, the world is filled with sadness and pain."
E_C19_May_Lucias_31,"We have suffered through similar hardship until you were born."
E_C19_May_Lucias_32,"You are the reason why we are able to smile today."
E_C19_May_Lucias_33,"I am also relieved... to know that everyone is happy..."
E_C19_May_Lucias_34,"(If I can use what little strength I have to help those in this village...)"
E_C19_May_Lucias_35,"(Will I be able to save those outside of this village as well?)"
E_C19_May_Lucias_36,"(To create a world... where everyone can be happy... without pain or suffering...)"
E_C19_May_Lucias_37,"There are people in the world that I could not save."
E_C19_May_Lucias_38,"Even now, I can still hear the voices through the chaos and horror coming from the palace."
E_C19_May_Lucias_39,"I don't think I can return home just yet."
E_C19_May_Lucias_40,"(Not until I can complete my mission...)"
E_C19_May_Lucias_41,"(I must save those in pain... and grant them peace.)"
E_C19_May_Lucias_42,"I'm sorry for turning down your kind offer."
E_C19_May_Lucias_43,"Hahaha, don't be!"
E_C19_May_Lucias_44,"If that's what you wish, I can't force you to leave."
E_C19_May_Lucias_45,"There wasn't much written in this letter..."
E_C19_May_Lucias_46,"I just made the suggestion since I felt that this person wanted you to get some rest."
E_C19_May_Lucias_47,"That might be a bit hard to do right now, ha ha."
E_C19_May_Lucias_48,"Wahaha, that's enough nagging from me today. You should really take it easy for today."
E_C19_May_Lucias_49,"...I will try my best. May the blessings of the Goddess be with you."
E_C19_May_Lucias_50,"Whew..."
E_C19_May_Lucias_51,"Huh? This is...?"
E_C19_May_Lucias_52,"I knew you were going to act like that. Have a great birthday."
E_C19_May_Lucias_53,"Hahaha, you're still the same..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_01,"……"
E_C19_May_Lavril_02,"Wow! That's a huge cake! Awesome! Happy birthday!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_03,"Happy birthday! Here's your present! I really like this, but I'll give it to you for your birthday!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_04,"Thanks! Let's dig in now! Look! My mom baked my favorite!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_05,"Hold on! You can't eat the cake yet! What about the song? And the fireworks!?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_06,"Then, let's sing quickly and eat the cake!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_07,"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_08,"Birthday...?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_09,"Hm? Welcome, Lavril."
E_C19_May_Lavril_10,"What is it?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_11,"Hello... Uh, I just have a question."
E_C19_May_Lavril_12,"U-uh, so... what's this festival going on in this village now?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_13,"A festival?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_14,"Yes, there are a lot of people talking about... birthdays."
E_C19_May_Lavril_15,"E-everyone looked really happy..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_16,"There's a giant cake, presents... and people singing together..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_17,"B-but if you don't know, Ophelia... Is it not a festival?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_18,"Ah, are you talking about a birthday party?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_19,"Birthday, party...?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_20,"Yeah! On someone's birthday, family and friends gather to celebrate."
E_C19_May_Lavril_21,"You receive presents from everyone and make a wish upon a candlelit cake..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_22,"Ah! And you get to eat a bunch of your favorite food."
E_C19_May_Lavril_23,"I see... Do you have a birthday too, Ophelia?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_24,"Heh, my birthday is in the summer. It's not too far off."
E_C19_May_Lavril_25,"We... don't have birthdays. Since we are... us...."
E_C19_May_Lavril_26,"We want... to have a party too..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_27,"It looks really fun... celebrating with friends..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_28,"Mm... Well, a birthday doesn't always have to be on the day of your birth."
E_C19_May_Lavril_29,"R-really?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_30,"Those who don't know their birthdays use a different holiday..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_31,"or choose a special day as their birthday to celebrate."
E_C19_May_Lavril_32,"So, why don't we make today your birthday, Lavril?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_33,"Today...?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_34,"Yeah. Since today is the day you learned about birthdays! What do you think?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_35,"O-okay...!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_36,"Then, let's have a party! Do you have any friends you want to invite?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_37,"Friends... Ophelia, Rephy, Shea... and... Can we invite Lucias as well...?"
E_C19_May_Lavril_38,"I'm sure he'll come to celebrate."
E_C19_May_Lavril_39,"I know that he's really busy, but he should be able to stop by."
E_C19_May_Lavril_40,"...Heh heh, that's good..."
E_C19_May_Lavril_41,"Okay, then let's write the invitations together!"
E_C19_May_Lavril_42,"...Right!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_01,"Hi, Kara! Good morning!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_02,"Did you sleep well, Master?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_03,"What happened just now is equivalent to the sun rising from the west."
E_C19_May_Kara01_04,"It's the first time you woke up without my alarm, Master."
E_C19_May_Kara01_05,"Hahaha! But today is Kara's birthday! I have to get up early on this important day!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_06,"What do you think? Were you surprised? Were you?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_07,"When I checked your pulse last night, you were asleep from sunset."
E_C19_May_Kara01_08,"Although it wasn't very probable, I could predict it."
E_C19_May_Kara01_09,"...Hm, I guess that was too weak."
E_C19_May_Kara01_10,"Wait! You always check my pulse?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_11,"It's for your safety, Master."
E_C19_May_Kara01_12,"...Geez, I really don't have any privacy... ha ha."
E_C19_May_Kara01_13,"*Grumble* I may have failed this time, but I'll succeed next time for sure!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_14,"Let's go, Kara! We need to go somewhere."
E_C19_May_Kara01_15,"Master, it's time for work."
E_C19_May_Kara01_16,"There's no need to work on a day like this! I have a lot of vacation time left! Let's go!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_17,"Yes, Master."
E_C19_May_Kara01_18,"It's time. They're... coming!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_19,"Initiating combat preparation."
E_C19_May_Kara01_20,"Meooooow!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_21,"Nya? Meow!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_22,"Meow! Purr... Purrrrr..."
E_C19_May_Kara01_23,"No. 1, 2, 3! Charge at Kara!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_24,"Ta-da! What do you think of my Cat Legion!?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_25,"Didn't you feel your heart race? Er, I mean, engine? Were you surprised?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_26,"I have already recognized an irregularity in your activity patterns despite your lack of exercise."
E_C19_May_Kara01_27,"I found you were taking care of the cats as I had followed you five months ago."
E_C19_May_Kara01_28,"Kinship Rate between No.1, 2, 3, and me is already maxed out."
E_C19_May_Kara01_29,"…Kara, you were following me..? That's creepy."
E_C19_May_Kara01_30,"Heh! But I'm going to make sure the last event succeeds for sure!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_31,"Now! It's time for the finale for your birthday!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_32,"Yes, Master."
E_C19_May_Kara01_33,"Where are we, Master? These coordinates are not included in my map data."
E_C19_May_Kara01_34,"Ahahaha! I have been keeping this place a secret for today!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_35,"Just wait a bit and... Wow! There it is! Kara, look!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_36,"I did not expect this. The moon looks incredibly large today."
E_C19_May_Kara01_37,"But the moon did not grow bigger, it is just an illusion..."
E_C19_May_Kara01_38,"Come on, Kara. This is a rare sight of this beautiful moon."
E_C19_May_Kara01_39,"Yes, Master."
E_C19_May_Kara01_40,"How do you feel?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_41,"Engine RPM rising. Neural circuits are circulating fast."
E_C19_May_Kara01_42,"It is as I am feeling a slight tingle of current that runs from my head to toe."
E_C19_May_Kara01_43,"Is this what you call being surprised?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_44,"It doesn't seem like you were surprised that much, but you managed to learn a new emotion. Heh."
E_C19_May_Kara01_45,"Here! This is my last present for you! Happy birthday, Kara!"
E_C19_May_Kara01_46,"Thank you, Master."
E_C19_May_Kara01_47,"But where did you get the money for those fireworks?"
E_C19_May_Kara01_48,"Huh? Obviously, it's coming out of this month's salary..."
E_C19_May_Kara01_49,"Understood, Master. I will reduce your personal expenditure budget this month by the cost of the fireworks."
E_C19_May_Kara01_50,"Wah! You're so cruel, Kara!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_01,"Fire the salute!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_02,"Happy birthday, Great Pirate Miruru!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_03,"Captain, happy birthday!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_04,"Yeah, thanks! Then, let's get on with it!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_05,"Ha? What you saying?"
E_C19_May_Miruru_06,"Isn't it obvious? When it comes to birthdays, you're suppose to prepare that!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_07,"That's right, stupid! This is what you get for birthdays! Here you are, Captain!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_08,"........."
E_C19_May_Miruru_09,"This isn't it!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_10,"Huh? I thought a cake would be appropriate for a birthday."
E_C19_May_Miruru_11,"Kyahaha! You idiot!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_12,"Ah, a cake is nice."
E_C19_May_Miruru_13,"But when it comes to birthdays, you're suppose to get presents!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_14,"Right!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_15,"Then, bring them out now."
E_C19_May_Miruru_16,"Here!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_17,"...What's this?"
E_C19_May_Miruru_18,"It's not a treasure?"
E_C19_May_Miruru_19,"Special gunpower from your friend Lakrak, Captain!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_20,"Message too!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_21,"Birthday? I busy with research! Happy birthday anyway!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_22,"And I give this for special too!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_23,"Hm... hm! Since it's a special gunpowder, I'll accept it, even if it's not a treasure!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_24,"Since I'm an honorable pirate who respects my friends!"
E_C19_May_Miruru_25,"Alright, then why don't I fire one off"
E_C19_May_Miruru_26,"to celebrate my birthday as the Great Pirate Miruru?"
E_C19_May_Miruru_27,"Hmm…"
E_C19_May_Miruru_28,"What?"
E_C19_May_Miruru_29,"I forgot something."
E_C19_May_Miruru_30,"Something important…"
E_C19_May_Miruru_31,"Ah."
E_C19_May_Miruru_32,"Lakrak told…"
E_C19_May_Miruru_33,"That gunpower not tested."
E_C19_May_Miruru_34,"Careful and,"
E_C19_May_Miruru_35,"report result."
E_C19_May_Miruru_36,"......"
E_C19_May_Miruru_37,"......"
E_C19_May_Miruru_38,"Should we run away first?"
E_C19_May_Miruru_39,"Good."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_1,"Hm..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_1_1,"I guess the wick is long enough."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_2,"It was bit of a nuisance getting the recipe, but it all worked out."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_3,"Now all I need is wait for him to come..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_4,"You called me night?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_5,"I awake three day researching weapon!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_6,"I really sleepy! How important it?!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_7,"Ha, here we go again..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_8,"Hey, Lakrak. Have you forgotten what day it is?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_9,"Today? I don't know. I don’t sleep three day."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_10,"And who you? Answer first!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_11,"You're still good at taking the wind out of my sails."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_12,"Look here, shouldn't you remember my face by now?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_13,"That weapon you're carrying around. You should've..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_14,"Did you forget who helped you finish that?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_15,"When I look back at those times when you ordered me around to get that stupid special gunpowder..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_16,"Special gunpower… Yes Remember! You Roi!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_17,"And I called him my friend..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_18,"Did you really forget what today is for you?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_19,"You should at least remember your own birthday."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_20,"Ack? Today my birthday?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_21,"No important!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_22,"Make strong weapon is more important!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_23,"You don't even surprise me anymore."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_24,"Anyway, I prepared something special for you."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_25,"Oh, that has a nice boom!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_26,"No wonder Cleo always uses stuff of the greatest quality."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_27,"Wh-what is it?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_28,"They're fireworks, as you can see. I prepared some big ones for your birthday."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_29,"What do you think? Aren't they pretty good?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_30,"Th-this… This…!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_31,"Ha ha, are you tearing up already? Wait until you see my present..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_32,"What you doing?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_33,"How dare use golden gunpower like this!?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_34,"You super idiot!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_35,"Wh-what?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_36,"Gunpower is only thing noble!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_37,"No way! You no my brother anymore!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_38,"......"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_39,"Are you... serious?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_40,"Useless? Do you know what I've gone through to prepare this?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_41,"No matter! You waste gunpower!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_42,"I never forgive you! Gunpower precious!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_43,"O-ho... Is that so?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_44,"I actually prepared an incredible present for your birthday..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_45,"I believe it was called…"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_46,"A newly invented Super Ultra Special Gunpowder or something?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_47,"It's considered the best within the Empire. It was tough, getting it through the black market..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_48,"Well, I guess it's no use since you don't need it."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_49,"Well then... How should I get rid of this stuff?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_50,"It should be pretty expensive if I sell them. I guess I won't have to worry about money for a while."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_51,"Or maybe I could pack them up again and give them to Cleo for her birthday."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_52,"Ha ha, I can just see the smile spreading across her face."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_53,"Hang on! We need talk!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_54,"Hm? Do you have any business with a blasphemer like me?"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_55,"E-eeek...!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_56,"Move aside if you don't have anything to say. I have to figure out how to deal with these..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_57,"I-I-I..."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_58,"I-I'm sorry! I talk harsh!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_59,"I want your present! That Super Ultra Special Gunpower! I want!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_60,"*Sigh...* Dealing with you is so exhausting."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_61,"Wah! Waaah! Waaaaaah!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_62,"Hey, Lakrak. I know you're happy, but give it a rest."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_63,"What you talk? This gunpower saint!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_64,"I want research it! My weapon will strong and best!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_65,"*Sigh...* You punk."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_66,"Anyway, I'm leaving now. Don't push yourself too hard."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_67,"Okay! Take care!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_68,"Wahaha! Roi care me! Roi the best!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_69,"Ack… But I can't remember Roi face. No!"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_70,"......"
E_C19_May_Lakrak_71,"I can't remember."
E_C19_May_Lakrak_72,"I don't know. I go see my present."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_01,"...Um..."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_02,"Hah hah."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_03,"...What in the world is an Imperial Guard doing in a place like this...?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_04,"I'm here to meet you, of course."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_05,"I thought you were a busy man, Sir Fluss?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_06,"You shouldn't waste time on a commoner knight like myself..."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_07,"Ha ha, but that commoner knight seems to be very noble and talented."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_08,"I just couldn't ignore such a person."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_09,"And the fact that she won the tournament three times in a row is intriguing as well."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_10,"You were my last opponent."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_11,"If we fought until the end, I would have lost for sure."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_12,"In that case, the three consecutive wins..."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_13,"Hah hah, I don't know what you're talking about."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_14,"Are you talking about that man with twin swords who fought with you so valiantly?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_15,"I really wanted to fight against him myself, but I could never figure out where he came from."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_16,"…"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_17,"Besides, I'm here to introduce you to a new friend today."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_18,"Nice to meet you, I am the Commander of the Velchia Magic Knights, Chrisha."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_19,"I am currently acting as the Emperor's inquisitor."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_20,"Ah, Commander Chrisha!?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_21,"What brings you here...?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_22,"(Hm, I was wondering who Sir Fluss was so interested in..."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_23,"I suppose if it's her, the famous Shield of Empire...)"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_24,"…???"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_25,"Ah, excuse me."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_26,"The purpose of my visit today is simple."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_27,"Happy birthday, Glenwys."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_28,"This is a present that Sir Fluss and I prepared. Please accept it."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_29,"...Ah! Th-thank you."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_30,"But how did you know that it's my birthday...?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_31,"Of course, through the regular letters... ahem! Never mind."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_32,"I heard from the Commander of the Capital Guard Knights that"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_33,"you spent your birthday alone last year too."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_34,"Ah..."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_35,"...Thank you for your kindness."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_36,"But it's a bit... too much."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_37,"There is no reason for you to show me this much care..."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_38,"Ha ha, let's just say we're investing in the future of a great talent."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_39,"If it's that much of a burden, why don't you treat us lunch then?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_40,"I'm starting to feel a bit hungry."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_41,"Hm, that's a good idea."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_42,"But since there are dishes I don't know about, I'll trust you to choose what we eat."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_43,"...Hahahaha."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_44,"Hm?"
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_45,"N-no, I'm just happy to know that you think well of me."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_46,"It may be cheap commoner food... but I hope you like them."
E_C19_May_Glenwys01_47,"…"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_01,"Great Sage of the Forest, we congratulate the birth of the great one!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_02,"Many blessings and peace upon the Elf Druid Lorraine!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_03,"I'm just very honored to receive such a warm welcome every year."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_04,"It's really nothing. Lorraine, you are a proud Great Sage of the Elves."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_05,"If it wasn't for you, we can't even imagine what would have happened to Elidora Forest."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_06,"Hah hah, don't flatter me like that. I'm embarrassed."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_07,"Oh, am I too late?"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_08,"Oh my, you are…!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_09,"Hahaha, I apologize."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_10,"I can't believe I'm late for the birthday of the Great Sage Druid."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_11,"No need to apologize. I'm just grateful to have you here, Chieftain of the Orcs."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_12,"I ended up making the Harpy Warrior get lost along the way as well... I'm sorry, Naila."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_13,"I joined you in this journey because we were heading the same way. You don't need to be sorry."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_14,"Great Sage of the Elves, as the representative of the Harpies, I, Naila, wish you a great birthday."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_15,"Thank you, Naila."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_16,"Good lord... Today's birthday party is going to be a lot more crowded than usual."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_17,"Ahhhhhh!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_18,"!?"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_19,"Ow!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_20,"What? Oddy...! What are you doing here?"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_21,"Oh, my head is spinning... Ah, Lorraine?"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_22,"Oof, looks like I made it!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_23,"I mean, Nyx promised me I was going to make it in time!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_24,"But he gave me the wrong stuff, so I had to come all the way from the Lamp-keeper Town!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_25,"Although I managed to pick up the Tamian Tribe present along the way... No, wait, that's not important!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_26,"Ahem, hm! Happy birthday, Lorraine!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_27,"Here! This is my present along with the Tamian Tribe's!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_28,"I almost took him out, thinking that he was an intruder... I did not expect him to be a friend of the Sage."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_29,"Hahaha, you don't let your guard down, even on a day like this. That's a warrior of the Harpies for you."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_30,"Anyway, are all of our guests here, then?"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_31,"Mm... I guess?"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_32,"It's a bit awkward to have the forest so crowded like this..."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_33,"Today is a fitting occasion for this, though. Hahaha."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_34,"Alright, Lorraine. It's time for the main event."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_35,"Happy birthday, Great Sage!"
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_36,"Everyone..."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_37,"Thank you so much. I will keep everyone's wishes with me for all eternity."
E_C19_May_Lorraine01_38,"(I hope this peace lasts forever and ever...)"
