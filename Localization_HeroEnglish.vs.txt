INN_ASELICA_GIFT01,"This is of no use to me...but still, thank you."
INN_CROW_INNIDLE01,"Don't get in my way."
INN_CROW_GREETING01,"What business do you have with me?"
INN_CROW_CONVERSATION01,"I will take only 1 job. Think carefully before you speak."
INN_CROW_CONVERSATION02,"It's hard to find ammunition around here…"
INN_CROW_CONVERSATION03,"This isn't a cigarette, it's merely candy."

INN_SHAMILLA_GIFT01,"Oh... A present for me. Haha, so what's your goal...?"
INN_KARA_INNIDLE01,"So many humans. More than I've ever seen."
INN_KARA_GREETING01,"Hello."
INN_KARA_CONVERSATION01,"Today's weather is... It's pretty clear. There will be some clouds at night."
INN_KARA_CONVERSATION02,"The food here is high quality. It doesn't have poison, so no need to worry."
INN_KARA_CONVERSATION03,"The palace is quiet, but this place is noisy."
INN_KARA_GIFT01,"So, this is the currency used today. My Master would like it."
INN_CHASE_INNIDLE01,"An unfamiliar atmosphere. Unfamiliar landscapes..."
INN_CHASE_GREETING01,"I don't remember you."

INN_ZAFIR_GREETING01,"May the blessings of the God King be with you."
INN_ZAFIR_CONVERSATION01,"Umm, this place is very different from the bars in the desert. We don't sit on the floor, do we?"
INN_ZAFIR_CONVERSATION02,"A Desert Warrior puts their people before anything else."
INN_ZAFIR_CONVERSATION03,"...I don't particularly fancy crowded places, but this carefree atmosphere... I can't say I hate it."

INN_LILIA_INNIDLE01,"...T-too many humans..."
INN_LILIA_GREETING01,"May the Flow be with you!"
INN_LILIA_CONVERSATION01,"I am not as kind as my sister."
INN_LILIA_CONVERSATION02,"Blue Dragons are weak? You couldn't be more wrong."
INN_LILIA_CONVERSATION03,"I am a grown-up Dragon. I am old enough!"
INN_LILIA_GIFT01,"Thanks, human child."
INN_LAUDIA_INNIDLE01,"Oh, what an interesting place. Is there any place for me to dance?"
INN_LAUDIA_GREETING01,"Hi. May the Flowing power be with you."

INN_ERZE_INNIDLE01,"They all look so appetizing... *Moan*"
INN_ERZE_GREETING01,"I know a thrilling game we can play together. How about it?"
INN_ERZE_CONVERSATION01,"Why do you look so scared?"
INN_ERZE_CONVERSATION02,"Why, are you afraid I'll bite you?"
INN_ERZE_CONVERSATION03,"You've never felt thrill like this before, I guarantee you that."
INN_ERZE_GIFT01,"Ha ha, there's no need for this... Why don't you just show me your neck?"
INN_NERAXIS_INNIDLE01,"Hmpf. What am I even doing here...?"
INN_NERAXIS_GREETING01,"Hmph, what does a human want with me?"
INN_NERAXIS_CONVERSATION01,"You're not worth talking to."
INN_NERAXIS_CONVERSATION02,"What do you want?"
INN_NERAXIS_CONVERSATION03,"Ha, ridiculous."
INN_NERAXIS_GIFT01,"I don't know what you want, but it's no use."

INN_SERIA_CONVERSATION01,"Looks like the night street is still safe here."
INN_SERIA_CONVERSATION02,"You've got some good comrades. Comrades... Ha."
INN_SERIA_CONVERSATION03,"Would I ever be able to have faith in anyone else again?..."

INN_LUCIAS_GREETING01,"A warm greeting to you. I hope you're having a blessed day."
INN_LUCIAS_CONVERSATION01,"There was a wedding ceremony nearby. Ahhh, it was such a divine sight."
INN_LUCIAS_CONVERSATION02,"Did you see Brother Baudouin? I heard he was quite drunk yesterday..."
INN_LUCIAS_CONVERSATION03,"I can feel all sorts of powers here. It feels like the center of the world..."
INN_LUCIAS_GIFT01,"May the Light bless you."
INN_CHRISHA_INNIDLE01,"Hmm. Orvel's inn isn't half bad after all."
INN_CHRISHA_GREETING01,"...What are you up to?"
INN_CHRISHA_CONVERSATION01,"Those eager to know about the Empire must prove themselves first."
INN_CHRISHA_CONVERSATION02,"The orders of His Majesty the Emperor are absolute and must be abided by."
INN_CHRISHA_CONVERSATION03,"I heard there is someone who is proficient in Technomagic in Orvel. I wonder what he or she is like."
INN_CHRISHA_GIFT01,"A gift? For me? What's the purpose of this?"
INN_NIA_INNIDLE01,"Grrr... Humans... Too many..."
INN_NIA_GREETING01,"*Sniff, sniff* Smell of light... and darkness..."
INN_NIA_CONVERSATION01,"...When... is time to eat...?"

INN_LAVRIL_GREETING01,"H-hello..."
INN_LAVRIL_CONVERSATION01,"P-please don't be mean to me..."
INN_LAVRIL_CONVERSATION02,"We're nice... Please don't hate us..."
INN_LAVRIL_CONVERSATION03,"S-stay with us a little longer, will you...?"
INN_LAVRIL_GIFT01,"Huh...? Th-thank you!"
INN_ESKER_INNIDLE01,"Shh! Don't tell anyone that you saw me."
INN_ESKER_GREETING01,"Do you want to play?\nI might let you win a game of two."
INN_ESKER_CONVERSATION01,"Keep your eyes open and see.\nAs soon as I throw this dice, a world of my creation will unfold in front of you."
INN_ESKER_CONVERSATION02,"Uh-oh. I know what the next roll is going to be.\nYou lose the moment you let your opponent read your mind."
INN_ESKER_CONVERSATION03,"Feeling angry that I keep winning? Come on, I'll let you win next time."
INN_ESKER_GIFT01,"Is that it?"
INN_GLENWYS_INNIDLE01,"It's a good inn, and everything here's nice and clean. The food looks amazing, too."
INN_GLENWYS_GREETING01,"Hello. How have you been doing?"
INN_GLENWYS_CONVERSATION01,"The village seems safe today."
INN_GLENWYS_CONVERSATION02,"Oh, just a loaf of bread and some soup would be fine. I don't really enjoy eating gourmet dishes."
INN_GLENWYS_CONVERSATION03,"Ha ha, a knight needs to rest sometimes."
INN_GLENWYS_GIFT01,"A present... for me? U-um... Th-thank you for your kindness."
INN_KASEL_GREETING02,"I'm seeing you around quite often. Are you getting to the capital now?"
INN_KASEL_CONVERSATION04,"Will all this end once I find the power of the Holy Sword?"
INN_KASEL_CONVERSATION05,"I don't want to be swayed by anyone else. I'll go my own way."
INN_KASEL_GIFT02,"A gift for an unpopular man like myself... Thank you."
INN_KASEL_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I am always thankful for your help."
INN_KASEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"It would be a lie to say it isn't difficult, but that's life, I guess."
INN_KASEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Thank you for sharing my burden. Really."
INN_KASEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"There is no such thing as a perfect life. Well, there are some perfect moments, though. Haha..."
INN_FREY_GREETING02,"There you are. You didn't get hurt, did you?"
INN_FREY_CONVERSATION04,"I see a bright light in my dreams sometimes. People with white wings with a brilliant sun behind them..."
INN_FREY_CONVERSATION05,"Who I like? Th-that's a secret between me and Lua."
INN_FREY_GIFT02,"Thank you. I won't forget your thoughtfulness."
INN_FREY_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I sincerely pray that Lua watches over you."
INN_FREY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Kasel's safety is important. He was chosen by the Goddess, after all."
INN_FREY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"All decisions can be met with disdain. I do not mind, as long as the Goddess is happy with it."
INN_FREY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"The relationship between God and priests is not so different from a relationship between simple people. Sometimes...we disagree."
INN_CLEO_GREETING02,"You're late! How dare you make the Archmage wait!?"
INN_CLEO_CONVERSATION04,"Who do I like more, between Frey and Roi? Does that question even make sense? Of course, Frey!"
INN_CLEO_CONVERSATION05,"I wonder where my mom is... As long as I'm alive, I should be able to meet her, right?"
INN_CLEO_GIFT02,"Oh! I think it will fit the Archmage! Thank you!"
INN_CLEO_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Oho, so you've come to see the best Archmage ever!"
INN_CLEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Frey is more than a pillow to me!"
INN_CLEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Don't forget. It's thanks to me that we can get around so fast."
INN_CLEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"You'll stick around with us, right?"
INN_ROI_GREETING02,"Hey, you should take a rest now."
INN_ROI_CONVERSATION04,"Aren't you sick of this? Cleo is my responsibility... I heard she'll be taking on an important role now."
INN_ROI_CONVERSATION05,"Have you ever done something you regretted? If you think you'll regret it, then stop right now."
INN_ROI_GIFT02,"You never forget... Thanks."
INN_ROI_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Ah, you've come."
INN_ROI_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Help Kasel when you can. He has a heavy burden."
INN_ROI_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"While I'm not the devout type, I also rely on Lua. I can't do much but pray for the people I've killed, after all…"
INN_ROI_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I do not mourn my past anymore. It can't be changed. What can be changed, however, is the future."
INN_GAU_GREETING02,"It's kind of embarrassing to be doing this."
INN_GAU_CONVERSATION04,"Have you seen Yanne lately? I wonder how she's doing..."
INN_GAU_CONVERSATION05,"What? How I know Lewisia? That kid... Even though she's older... It's not like it'll work out just because I like her..."
INN_GAU_GIFT02,"Thank you. I'll treat you next time."
INN_GAU_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Ha! We meet again! Doing well?"
INN_GAU_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Ah...that little Lei became such a fine lady...and to think that her real age was...hahaha!"
INN_GAU_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I'll shatter you to pieces! - Well, how was that? The kids laugh when I act like that."

INN_PHILLOP_GREETING02,"Welcome. Here! Raise your glass!"
INN_PHILLOP_CONVERSATION04,"The war from 100 years ago... I was as young as you when I was with King Kyle..."
INN_PHILLOP_CONVERSATION05,"Sometimes, I miss my days as a warrior. Back then, I didn't have this many problems."
INN_PHILLOP_GIFT02,"You didn't have to. I would have preferred liquor, though. Ha ha!"
INN_PHILLOP_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hello, friend! Have a drink, eh?"
INN_PHILLOP_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I killed plenty of Mad Dragons and Draconics back in my day. Enough to curl any dwarfish beard, eh."
INN_PHILLOP_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Need a new weapon? I do have some Dwarfish axes back in my trunk."
INN_PHILLOP_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Hahaha, you're a funny one. Yes, if you ever need the aid of the Dwarves, we will be there to help."

INN_KAULAH_GREETING02,"I hope my wind helps you rest, even if it's for a little while."
INN_KAULAH_CONVERSATION04,"I still can't get used to the city. But it's good to see lively people."
INN_KAULAH_CONVERSATION05,"The wind will keep blowing, even if time passes... Just like your hardships will also pass."
INN_KAULAH_GIFT02,"I'll use it well during this trip."
INN_KAULAH_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I thought I felt a friendly wind. Welcome back, friend."
INN_KAULAH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Tough as a boulder. Gentle as the breeze. That is how your aura feels."
INN_KAULAH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Have you ever climbed to the top of the mountains in Ogria? True beauty awaits on top of the summit."
INN_KAULAH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I had a premonition last night. One where you saved the world..."
INN_EPIS_GREETING02,"Welcome, dear! Did you close the door?"
INN_EPIS_CONVERSATION04,"Oh, what did you expect? Oh, you are devious."
INN_EPIS_CONVERSATION05,"You want to know why a demon is siding with the humans? Does it really look like that? Ha ha."
INN_EPIS_GIFT02,"Not bad. You seem to know a little something about seduction. So, does that make you more like me?"
INN_EPIS_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hmm~ based off your expression, I'm assuming you met me in your dreams last night?"
INN_EPIS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Aha~so, how was your dream? Satisfying? Or would you like to continue where it left off…"
INN_EPIS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Haaaah...There's this thing on my mind. I keep thinking about you...Do you know why~?"
INN_EPIS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"These clothes seem to be getting tighter. I wonder if I've gained weight...? Do you want to check for me, back at my room?"
INN_SELENE_GREETING02,"Today was a great day, having met you."
INN_SELENE_CONVERSATION04,"I've lived to protect the forest since I was young. That's why I always loved the story of the Holy Sword."
INN_SELENE_CONVERSATION05,"The Warrior of the Holy Sword who defeated the Dark Lord and brought peace to the world 100 years ago... Now we must create a new legend."
INN_SELENE_GIFT02,"This is...! Thank you for your generosity."
INN_SELENE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Today seems to be another nice, sunny day - full of the happiness and warmth."
INN_SELENE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Perhaps I've been too hard on the Warrior, forcing my ideals and thoughts on him…"
INN_SELENE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Visit Elidora Forest at some time. I will greet you personally."
INN_SELENE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"This bow is a special token of friendship given to me by a Wind Elemental. You may touch it if you want."
INN_MARIA_GREETING02,"So what do you need?"
INN_MARIA_CONVERSATION04,"You still seem kind of clueless. You've still got a long way to go until you can face them."
INN_MARIA_CONVERSATION05,"You don't know... So, you don't know what Lua really looks like. It's better if you don't."
INN_MARIA_GIFT02,"Ha ha... Alright. This will be good feed for the crows."
INN_MARIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"..Hmph, you came. I see, you are no longer a mere novice."
INN_MARIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"When I look at you, I am reminded of him in his youth…hmm…"
INN_MARIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I hate Lua for what she did...but you, you are different."
INN_MARIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"You are an odd one, accepting a corrupted witch into your fold...how cute."
INN_MIRURU_GREETING02,"Welcome! My Number One honorary subordinate!!!"
INN_MIRURU_CONVERSATION04,"Hm... My past? Whenever I try to remember something... I go bam!!! And I just fall from the bed."
INN_MIRURU_CONVERSATION05,"But there's something I remember. A burning thirst... and writing on a map... The Fountain of Life?"
INN_MIRURU_GIFT02,"You really are my subordinate! Now, the treasure trove of the Miruru Pirates is full!"
INN_MIRURU_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Heya~ welcome back!!"
INN_MIRURU_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Let us work hard today as well! For the sake of the Miruru Pirates!"
INN_MIRURU_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Did you bring any treasure? Where? Where? Where? Show me!"
INN_MIRURU_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"My cannon? Yeah, I made it myself! It's awesome, right? Right?!"
INN_LORRAINE_GREETING02,"I always welcome the chance to spend time with you."
INN_LORRAINE_CONVERSATION04,"A major crossroad awaits you. Light and shadow... will converge into one path..."
INN_LORRAINE_CONVERSATION05,"Unlike Elves, who are known for their longevity, humans live shorter lives, but they shine brighter in their prime."
INN_LORRAINE_GIFT02,"I'll consider it as a gift given out of your generosity."
INN_LORRAINE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"You have grown strong, just, and pure."
INN_LORRAINE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"You seem to have the purest soul I've seen in a while."
INN_LORRAINE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"It would be nice if these times of peaceful enjoyment could last forever...but that would be a vice."
INN_LORRAINE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I will never forget you. Not as the Sage, but as a simple elf."
INN_CLAUSE_GREETING02,"Ha ha! The Guardian Knights also need to rest. Come, take a seat here."
INN_CLAUSE_CONVERSATION04,"I didn't expect Kasel to get that strong. He used to cry and follow me everywhere... And now he's the master of the Holy Sword... Ha ha."
INN_CLAUSE_CONVERSATION05,"Am I jealous of Kasel? No way! He's my brother, and I'm proud of him."
INN_CLAUSE_GIFT02,"All this... I'm flattered. I'll have to work even harder."
INN_CLAUSE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hahaha, good to see you again!"
INN_CLAUSE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"My justice isn't really anything too fancy. A belief that I will never be ashamed of - that is my justice."
INN_CLAUSE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"A high-ranking position doesn't mean you can get a lot done. It might get you stuck in the castle with all the paperwork."
INN_CLAUSE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I know I need to help that person, but right now, there are more pressing matters - the people suffering all across Orvelia."
INN_REPHY_GREETING02,"It's warm! The souls will like this place!"
INN_REPHY_CONVERSATION04,"Can you hear that? The stars outside the window are whispering to us!"
INN_REPHY_CONVERSATION05,"Human, I'll invite you to our forest next time!"
INN_REPHY_GIFT02,"A surprise gift? Humans really are good friends!"
INN_REPHY_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hi! Your soul is as pure as usual!"
INN_REPHY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"The forest feels good! Clear air, refreshing winds, dancing fairies..."
INN_REPHY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Leave the guiding to me! The souls will help us!"
INN_REPHY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"The stars say, today will be a good day! Let's go out!"
INN_DIMAEL_GREETING02,"This place isn't so bad."
INN_DIMAEL_CONVERSATION04,"I like shaded areas. I hate the glaring brightness."
INN_DIMAEL_CONVERSATION05,"Darkness is my primal source of my power."
INN_DIMAEL_GIFT02,"Why do you keep giving me these things? I hate dealing with troublesome things like this."
INN_DIMAEL_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"So, you're here. Find anything useful?"
INN_DIMAEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"When is the next hunt? I do hope it is as fruitful as the last."
INN_DIMAEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"This dark power is mine now. I shall continue to wield it as I see fit."
INN_DIMAEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"My revenge isn't truly over...but at least for the time being, I feel at ease."
INN_REINA_GREETING02,"Eek, this place is amazing!"
INN_REINA_CONVERSATION04,"Do you have any clients to introduce me to? Someone good-looking if possible!!!"
INN_REINA_CONVERSATION05,"I don't like boring work! Heh heh!"
INN_REINA_GIFT02,"Wow! For me? Really? Heh heh, you're the best!"
INN_REINA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hey there, good looking! It's been a while!"
INN_REINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"People these days! They think I'm some kind of pervert, but that's a misunderstanding! I just like men's bodies!"
INN_REINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"At times, I grow reminiscent of the better life. You know, like in moments where it's raining outside and you have to sleep in the mud."
INN_REINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Even while working as a mercenary, sometimes the jobs are't quite savory. It makes me think…about this and that…"
INN_PAVEL_GREETING02,"Why is this place so warm...?"
INN_PAVEL_CONVERSATION04,"Be quiet... Let me rest now..."
INN_PAVEL_CONVERSATION05,"I can't feel any coldness from you..."
INN_PAVEL_GIFT02,"....Thank you."
INN_PAVEL_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"...You look well."
INN_PAVEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I was originally human...so I can understand."
INN_PAVEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Are you curious about dragons...?"
INN_PAVEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Her soul whispers to me...she is curious about you..."
INN_DEMIA_GREETING02,"Thank you for inviting me."
INN_DEMIA_CONVERSATION04,"Please let me know if you find out anything about the Dark Legion."
INN_DEMIA_CONVERSATION05,"We are ready to fight anytime. For Orvelia!"
INN_DEMIA_GIFT02,"I'll share this with the soldiers."
INN_DEMIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I hear you have been looking for me. What is it?"
INN_DEMIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I worry about the princess. She's still young and gentle...it must be hard."
INN_DEMIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Hmph, why can't that tin can stay around and protect the princess…such a bothersome man…"
INN_DEMIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Me? Um, well...going out to battle alongside you isn't all that bad. It is good exercise."
INN_NAILA_GREETING02,"So, this is what a human's house looks like."
INN_NAILA_CONVERSATION04,"My sister always told me to remember the pride of a Harpy."
INN_NAILA_CONVERSATION05,"I will become the best Harpy warrior in the world."
INN_NAILA_GIFT02,"I'll pay you back."
INN_NAILA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"How are you doing? Did you continue your training?"
INN_NAILA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"A true warrior never stops developing their skills!"
INN_NAILA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Honor, pride - some may call them useless, but they are important to me."
INN_NAILA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Next time, let's spar, one on one. Alright?"
INN_RODINA_GREETING02,"Oh! Thank you for the invite!"
INN_RODINA_CONVERSATION04,"I'm hungry! Please give me food!"
INN_RODINA_CONVERSATION05,"Vegetables! Muhroom!"
INN_RODINA_GIFT02,"Thank you for the food!"
INN_RODINA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Ah!? Salutations!! Have you eaten yet!"
INN_RODINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"A soldier's gun is equal to their life! Would you like to see my well-maintained rifle!?"
INN_RODINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"The frost mage who lives in the Ice Cavern is far more gentle than you think! He still tries to pretend otherwise, so I turn a blind eye!"
INN_RODINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Is Sir Fluss not here? Thanks to him, life isn't all that bad!"
INN_MORRAH_GREETING02,"How shabby."
INN_MORRAH_CONVERSATION04,"Stop bothering me if you don't want to die."
INN_MORRAH_CONVERSATION05,"Don't bother me. I didn't have a choice."
INN_MORRAH_GIFT02,"You think I'd like this?"
INN_MORRAH_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"You're here. Is the next battle decided?"
INN_MORRAH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I have pledged my allegience to Maria. However...I have a debt to pay to you as well."
INN_MORRAH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"General of the Draconics...Yes, that was my past. I didn't have any other goals..."
INN_MORRAH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I am a Demon created for destruction, a Draconic...but still..."
INN_BAUDOUIN_GREETING02,"This wild and unrestrained atmosphere! I love it!"
INN_BAUDOUIN_CONVERSATION04,"Violence should be met with violence! That's what the gods have said! Kwahahaha!"
INN_BAUDOUIN_CONVERSATION05,"My friend! Let's have a drink!"
INN_BAUDOUIN_GIFT02,"Kwahahaha, I'll give you Lua's blessing in return!"
INN_BAUDOUIN_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Wow! Huh, you seem to be really blessed by the Goddess! You're practically shining!"
INN_BAUDOUIN_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"If I went to the Empire at that time...father, was I really right..."
INN_BAUDOUIN_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Eh, the Order of Lua isn't what you think it is, you know? God or not, it's still just a group of people."
INN_BAUDOUIN_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"There's one thing I want to say to you. Enjoy life while you can! You know, life is short! You don't want to regret anything!"
INN_JANE_GREETING02,"Where... is this...?"
INN_JANE_CONVERSATION04,"It's cold... No... Warm..."
INN_JANE_CONVERSATION05,"I... don't... remember... I... want... to remember..."
INN_JANE_GIFT02,"Gift...? Why do you keep giving me things?"
INN_JANE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Welcome back...a greeting...for him...when he returns..."
INN_JANE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Red lightning...warm hands...gentle eyes...no memory..."
INN_JANE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Lost memories...emptiness...."
INN_JANE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"The coffin...the never changing warmth..."
INN_AISHA_GREETING02,"This house isn't that nice."
INN_AISHA_CONVERSATION04,"Ugh... I don't need food. I don't think I'll like it."
INN_AISHA_CONVERSATION05,"I'll bring a luxurious car next time I come."
INN_AISHA_GIFT02,"Thank you. Let me know if you want anything."
INN_AISHA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Sister went out for a while, so do not worry."
INN_AISHA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Do not be mislead by the smiles of nobles. Their smiles are but mere masks to hide themselves with."
INN_AISHA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I do not like the fact that I cannot call Priscilla 'Sister' at home. She's just like family!"
INN_AISHA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"The title of Violet...there is no hiearchy between The Seven, but I dislike being the last color of the spectrum!"
INN_LEO_GREETING02,"Oh, it's so cozy!"
INN_LEO_CONVERSATION04,"You don't have that many books! Should I bring you some from my house?"
INN_LEO_CONVERSATION05,"You can learn anything from books!"
INN_LEO_GIFT02,"Thank you! I'll invite you to our house sometime!"
INN_LEO_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hello. What's today's news?"
INN_LEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I wrote in a lot of new entries today. Every day brings new knowledge."
INN_LEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"There seems to be a lot of fun things outside. Maybe I should go out a bit more…"
INN_LEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Do you have a minute? I brought a new book..."
INN_FLUSS_GREETING02,"I brought some flowers since you invited me."
INN_FLUSS_CONVERSATION04,"People are like swords. You have to continue to cultivate yourself to become a true knight."
INN_FLUSS_CONVERSATION05,"I really don't like Pavel. To leave Rodina like that..."
INN_FLUSS_GIFT02,"Cheers to your kindness."
INN_FLUSS_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"A toast to your...no, I'll stop right there."
INN_FLUSS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"My house wasn't originally part of the Empire."
INN_FLUSS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"This flower is an offering to my ancestor's homeland. It is a symbol, a memoir to remember their fallen homeland."
INN_FLUSS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Our Order is just a front, mostly comprised of inexperienced children from noble families. The truly fearful warriors are elsewhere…"
INN_LUNA_GREETING02,"Hello! Luna is here again!"
INN_LUNA_CONVERSATION04,"This place is fun! Luna likes it a lot! Very much!"
INN_LUNA_CONVERSATION05,"Luna will give you a blessing! With carrots!"
INN_LUNA_GIFT02,"This is a real carrot, right?"
INN_LUNA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Luna is doing well!"
INN_LUNA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Luna has lots of friends back home! But Luna doesn't remember where home is!"
INN_LUNA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Everyone thinks Luna's favorite thing is carrots! And yes, that is correct~!"
INN_LUNA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Ah, um...do you have a carrot?"
INN_LAIAS_GREETING02,"Ha ha, I have a feeling today will be a good day."
INN_LAIAS_CONVERSATION04,"Humans have limitless potential. They're a truly mysterious race."
INN_LAIAS_CONVERSATION05,"Times have changed, but humans are still very interesting."
INN_LAIAS_GIFT02,"Thank you. I'll send it to the kids in the temple."
INN_LAIAS_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hmm, you look healthy. That is good."
INN_LAIAS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Child of Man, what do you wish to do with that power?"
INN_LAIAS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Angels, Demons, Humans, Dragons...the flow ties everything together."
INN_LAIAS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I will lend my power to your flow."
INN_ARCH_GREETING02,"It's good to see you, follower of the light."
INN_ARCH_CONVERSATION04,"The fate of the world is in your hands."
INN_ARCH_CONVERSATION05,"You, who received the blessing of the goddess, what will you do with that power?"
INN_ARCH_GIFT02,"I don't know how I'll use it, but thank you."
INN_ARCH_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"May the light be with you, my friend."
INN_ARCH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Demons… they are scum that must be executed, but the few that help us… \nI do not know what to do with them."
INN_ARCH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Your existence is like a bright beacon. Keep your soul pure, my friend."
INN_ARCH_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I once thought that your kind were weak. But now, I have learned that strength comes in many forms."
INN_LEWICIA_GREETING02,"Hm, it's a great day."
INN_LEWICIA_CONVERSATION04,"My status as a princess? Hm... I've never really thought about it."
INN_LEWICIA_CONVERSATION05,"This place is much better than the dark and damp place where I'm from."
INN_LEWICIA_GIFT02,"A gift? Thank you. I'll have to prepare something for you next time."
INN_LEWICIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hello. Isn't it quite nice out today?"
INN_LEWICIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"My body is recovering quickly nowadays. It's all thanks to you."
INN_LEWICIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Why do I sometimes revert to my younger forms even when I'm getting better? Well, I get bored...and people give me snacks."
INN_LEWICIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I like this place because it's comfortable… so i plan to stay a bit longer, by your side."
INN_NICX_GREETING02,"We meet again. Nice to see you."
INN_NICX_CONVERSATION04,"Traveling is fun. It's a chance to put everything down and enjoy freedom for a while."
INN_NICX_CONVERSATION05,"My hobby is collecting swords."
INN_NICX_GIFT02,"Oh, this is such a nice gift. Thank you."
INN_NICX_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hmm. I knew you were coming."
INN_NICX_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"If you wish to go anywhere, tell me. I shall open a portal for you."
INN_NICX_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I have an interest in seeing how you save this world."
INN_NICX_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Do you wish to know about my magic? Haha, it involves some complicated calculations."
INN_ANNETTE_GREETING02,"Experiments, experiments, such fun experiments! Huh? Hello!"
INN_ANNETTE_CONVERSATION04,"These cuties are growing well! They'll be able to go out to the field soon!"
INN_ANNETTE_CONVERSATION05,"1 cutie for each person! How's it?"
INN_ANNETTE_GIFT02,"Heh heh, I'll get lots of funds...!"
INN_ANNETTE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hi! Did you study a lot today?"
INN_ANNETTE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Yeaaaaah!! Now, let's go and do an experiment based on my latest thesis!"
INN_ANNETTE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I've gotten a raise on my research fees! Thanks to that, I can do much more in my laboratory!"
INN_ANNETTE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I want to share my cuties with everyone!"
INN_MITRA_GREETING02,"Oh, it's a great day for shooting."
INN_MITRA_CONVERSATION04,"Things were good back then. That old guy may be strict, but he sure takes good care of his men.\nSo when he left the army... I quit, too! Hahaha!"
INN_MITRA_CONVERSATION05,"Oh, I wonder what the old man is doing."
INN_MITRA_GIFT02,"Oh, thank you."
INN_MITRA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Oh, you're still alive! Hahaha!"
INN_MITRA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"These guns of mine make me feel good. They're also kind of messed up…like me!"
INN_MITRA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Kahaha! You know, these bastards whisper to me sometimes, eh. \nPull the trigger, pull it, pull it~!!! Or so they say~"
INN_MITRA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"There's apparently a scary bounty hunter and former Imperial Navy on your tail. What does that feel like, eh? Hehehe…"
INN_RICARDO_GREETING02,"How are you? Health is the most important thing!"
INN_RICARDO_CONVERSATION04,"It looks like you've been training hard! Kwahahaha!!!"
INN_RICARDO_CONVERSATION05,"Liquor? I love it! Though, I can't drink as much as I used to!"
INN_RICARDO_GIFT02,"I'll have to buy some new clothes for the kids! Hahahaha!"
INN_RICARDO_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Haha, you look good today!"
INN_RICARDO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"When fighting with Demons, there are always a lot of civilian casualties… even more than the cases of normal wars between humans."
INN_RICARDO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"My age? Hahaha, it wouldn't be odd if I retired right now! They won't let me, though…"
INN_RICARDO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Life is a series of constant training! Don't slack off on exercise, now!"
INN_TANYA_GREETING02,"...Hmm."
INN_TANYA_CONVERSATION04,"I refuse to work as a janitor..."
INN_TANYA_CONVERSATION05,"...You might get killed anytime."
INN_TANYA_GIFT02,"...I don't... need it..."
INN_TANYA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"… So you came."
INN_TANYA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Sorry… I am not the talkative type."
INN_TANYA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"No fun would come of talking to a person like me..."
INN_TANYA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Why are you interested in someone like me...? I do not understand..."
INN_EZEKIEL_GREETING02,"I'm tired because I didn't get enough sleep."
INN_EZEKIEL_CONVERSATION04,"I-I wonder what that fool from the Republic of Gray is up to nowadays."
INN_EZEKIEL_CONVERSATION05,"You mean my hair? It looks great, right? This hair sticking up is what makes this style."
INN_EZEKIEL_GIFT02,"Oh, thank you!"
INN_EZEKIEL_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Oh? So, you've already talked with the lame kid?"
INN_EZEKIEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I don't care that my father's a Demon. I'm strong, thanks to that!"
INN_EZEKIEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"That kiddo is too much of a softie. Nobody can hurt us!"
INN_EZEKIEL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Yeah, sometimes I can't control my own power. But hey, it's still fun in its own way! Hahaha!!"
INN_CASSANDRA_GREETING02,"Oh, hello!"
INN_CASSANDRA_CONVERSATION04,"I heard some people dilute liquor with water... *Sigh...* I'm worried."
INN_CASSANDRA_CONVERSATION05,"It's my job, so my body mixes up day and night. I'm so tired."
INN_CASSANDRA_GIFT02,"Oh! Thank you, I'll use it well."
INN_CASSANDRA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hmm, I was just thinking about you. Apparently you were, too~?"
INN_CASSANDRA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Winning over the minds of people is my job...but I won't do that on you."
INN_CASSANDRA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Keep this secret - not only the Empire, but Orvelia is also holding many deals as of late...especially those from the Royal Palace..."
INN_CASSANDRA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Even while sharing a glass of wine...sometimes, it feels as if I'm alone. With you, though..."
INN_THEO_GREETING02,"Hello."
INN_THEO_CONVERSATION04,"Not all demons are evil... Like that cat, you know."
INN_THEO_CONVERSATION05,"I've used a spear ever since I was young. I'm used to wielding a spear."
INN_THEO_GIFT02,"Thank you. My heart is warming up."
INN_THEO_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"How are you? It has been a while."
INN_THEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"It was the first time I felt so warm inside...as if the Sun was standing just before my eyes."
INN_THEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"A lot of people ask me - why go so far? I say...I have merely been living the way my heart tells me to."
INN_THEO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"If she doesn't recognize me when we finally meet...I do not know what expression I should make..."
INN_MEDIANA_GREETING02,"Hello. I came to rest, so this is good."
INN_MEDIANA_CONVERSATION04,"The new drug? Ha ha, I'm testing it out."
INN_MEDIANA_CONVERSATION05,"Gotta take notes... I have to jot down all my ideas."
INN_MEDIANA_GIFT02,"Oh, thank you. I'll be able to create a new poison, hahaha..."
INN_MEDIANA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"How are you doing? Please tell me if you feel sick."
INN_MEDIANA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I know I'm a bit strange. But well, that's just how I am."
INN_MEDIANA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"One day, I believe that medicine and treatment will do better than healing magic."
INN_MEDIANA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"You are not my test subject, you are more like…the final recipient. Ah, not for poisons. I meant that as a doctor."
INN_ODDY_GREETING02,"Hmm? Oh, you're here."
INN_ODDY_CONVERSATION04,"You don't have time? Ha ha, then just make time."
INN_ODDY_CONVERSATION05,"You've never seen a Redpur before? Not surprised. They're always hiding!"
INN_ODDY_GIFT02,"A gift? Hm, I'll have to prepare something next time."
INN_ODDY_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Welcome, welcome!"
INN_ODDY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Ah, I miss my Redpur friends..."
INN_ODDY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I don't really remember my days as a human. It has been so long."
INN_ODDY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I thought I was the first to invent the pocket watch, but apparently ancient civilizations were far more advanced than I expected."
INN_VISKA_GREETING02,"Oh, I think I smell something delicious?"
INN_VISKA_CONVERSATION04,"I'm hungry... Do you have anything good to eat? Nothing? Really?"
INN_VISKA_CONVERSATION05,"Demon souls are the best, but regular food is pretty good, too!"
INN_VISKA_GIFT02,"Something good! Something good!"
INN_VISKA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hey there. I'm still hungry, you know..."
INN_VISKA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Me? Well, I'm just a normal village girl...who is posessed by a Demon. Nothing more, nothing less."
INN_VISKA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"My form during battles? Ah, that's Viska, the Demon inside me. Normally, she lets me control my body, but when we fight..."
INN_VISKA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I don't feel anything about eating Demons. In fact, they rather deserve it… and well, the two of us are now one..."
INN_PRISCILLA_GREETING02,"It's you. Good to see you."
INN_PRISCILLA_CONVERSATION04,"I hope my lady likes the new tea set I bought."
INN_PRISCILLA_CONVERSATION05,"I'll have to stop by the forge to sharpen my axe."
INN_PRISCILLA_GIFT02,"Thank you. I hope you prepare some fresh tea next time."
INN_PRISCILLA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"So it's you… it's been a while."
INN_PRISCILLA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Perhaps my past subordinates have suffered too much from my youthful outbursts..."
INN_PRISCILLA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"She was such a small child, trying so hard to be an adult… So, I felt that I had to protect her."
INN_PRISCILLA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I am satisfied with my current life. My wages are decent enough to let me help with my past subordinates' lives, too."
INN_YANNE_GREETING02,"Long time? How have you been?"
INN_YANNE_CONVERSATION04,"The food here is pretty good."
INN_YANNE_CONVERSATION05,"Hm. Maybe next time I'll ask Juno to make me some lunch?"
INN_YANNE_GIFT02,"Oh, thank you! I'll use it well."
INN_YANNE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Heya, you look healthy! Are you eating properly?"
INN_YANNE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Ever tried Dragon meat? It's pretty good. I'll bring some Dragon steak next time!"
INN_YANNE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Work as a monster hunter isn't easy, but it's worth it."
INN_YANNE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Barbarian warriors are all pretty strong...but my body is pretty special."
INN_OPHELIA_GREETING02,"Nice to meet you!"
INN_OPHELIA_CONVERSATION04,"I learned to shuffle cards from a good friend."
INN_OPHELIA_CONVERSATION05,"I love having a good laugh with people every day."
INN_OPHELIA_GIFT02,"I'll tell you your fortune in return."
INN_OPHELIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Do you want your fortune told? If you do, sit with me!"
INN_OPHELIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"This child is very special to me. Ah, be careful! You might get burned!"
INN_OPHELIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I don't feel bad for straying off the path of my pilgrimage. I am still a witch, and I have pride in my profession."
INN_OPHELIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Ah! This card tells me that my fateful partner is near! Very close too...ah, perhaps...?"
INN_REQUINA_GREETING02,"Nice to meet you! I brought some poison for you! Pick what you want!"
INN_REQUINA_CONVERSATION04,"Poison is amazing! Once you fall for it, you can't go back!"
INN_REQUINA_CONVERSATION05,"This weed hasn't been growing. Should I sell some rare poison instead? What do you think?"
INN_REQUINA_GIFT02,"Oh, thank you! I'll let you buy some special Requina-style poison! Heh heh."
INN_REQUINA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Welcome back~ hahaha, today was a haul!"
INN_REQUINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Doctors, assassins, chemists and alchemists...all of them are my important clients!"
INN_REQUINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Why I use poison darts? Well, they're quiet and easy to use! Well, they wouldn't be quite nice in the wrong hands...but~"
INN_REQUINA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Poisons that work on Demons? I'm researching that. I have a few close to perfection...wanna see?"
INN_ASELICA_GREETING02,"Warrior. So, this is your resting place."
INN_ASELICA_CONVERSATION04,"The Demons are evil. They must be annihilated, no matter what."
INN_ASELICA_CONVERSATION05,"Don't forget that the sun is always shining behind you."
INN_ASELICA_GIFT02,"Humans can be very thoughtful. Anyway, thank you."
INN_ASELICA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I feel the warmth of the sun from you. Did anything good happen?"
INN_ASELICA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"So there are Demons attempting to save the world. How odd."
INN_ASELICA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"The Sanctuary of the Angels is where we all return to at some point."
INN_ASELICA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I am your Guardian - and thus, I offer up my arms to you."
INN_CROW_GREETING02,"Why did you call me? Just tell me what you need."
INN_CROW_CONVERSATION04,"He was a real headache, even when he was under my command.\nBut I don't think he'd do something like that. That's why I accepted that offer."
INN_CROW_CONVERSATION05,"Obviously, the others couldn't bear his madness. That's why I took charge."
INN_CROW_GIFT02,"Give me candy."
INN_CROW_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"What business…ah, it's you."
INN_CROW_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Orvel is a good place. Even the air is different from the Empire."
INN_CROW_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I thought, as part of the Navy, I would be out at sea for my entire life. In retrospect, going out to sea was the worst decision ever."
INN_CROW_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I had two people I cared about dearly. I cannot meet them anymore… but yes, haha… they both hated cigarette smoke."
INN_SCARLET_GREETING02,"Good to see you."
INN_SCARLET_CONVERSATION04,"We must not forget that the people are the backbone of this country."
INN_SCARLET_CONVERSATION05,"I'm worried about my father's illness."
INN_SCARLET_GIFT02,"Thank you as always. I'll use it well."
INN_SCARLET_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"We meet again. Take a seat… let us talk."
INN_SCARLET_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Do you also think not only the capital of Orvel, \nbut the entirety of Orvelia, has changed…?"
INN_SCARLET_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"It would be a lie to say I am not tired… but even so, I try not to be."
INN_SCARLET_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I have trustworthy retainers at my side. Thanks to them, I can still go on… \nHaha, so obstinate and straightforward, that one."
INN_SONIA_GREETING02,"Hello? I just stopped by."
INN_SONIA_CONVERSATION04,"If you want to spar, let me know. Of course, it'll hurt a lot! You might get electrocuted!"
INN_SONIA_CONVERSATION05,"Huh? Mirianne is here, too?"
INN_SONIA_GIFT02,"Huh? For me? Really?"
INN_SONIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Eh, you want to talk to me? You're weird..."
INN_SONIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"You're curious about me? Well...I did tell you I'm a homunculus."
INN_SONIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Fighting style? Ah, I use the Core of Electricity inside my body to..."
INN_SONIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Friends and family? Oh...um, Ricardo, Mirianne...and maybe...you?"
INN_ARTEMIA_GREETING02,"No need to kneel."
INN_ARTEMIA_CONVERSATION04,"It looks like I'm not the only one who was chosen by the light."
INN_ARTEMIA_CONVERSATION05,"I wonder if the Royal Guard kids are doing well."
INN_ARTEMIA_GIFT02,"Thank you for your generosity."
INN_ARTEMIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"You seem to be doing well."
INN_ARTEMIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Father and Mother no longer bear the heavy burden of the crown. They now enjoy their lives together, without worry."
INN_ARTEMIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Few of the Knights here at Orvelia are gems that any ruler would want at their court."
INN_ARTEMIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I shall not avoid the responsibility that falls into my hands. However, it is nice that I have you to share my burdens with."
INN_MIRIANNE_GREETING02,"I'm here again! Nice to meet you!"
INN_MIRIANNE_CONVERSATION04,"I brought some pretty clothes! Please pick something that will fit me!"
INN_MIRIANNE_CONVERSATION05,"Heh heh. Can I come play with Sonia?"
INN_MIRIANNE_GIFT02,"Thank you! Let's go see Grandpa together next time!"
INN_MIRIANNE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Ah, you came! Hehe, will you rest for a bit?"
INN_MIRIANNE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"This bustling atmosphere feels like back home at the orphanage~"
INN_MIRIANNE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Are you hungry? Would you like a snack?"
INN_MIRIANNE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I love these clothes, they're so pretty and fluttery~"
INN_SHEA_GREETING02,"I'm here to bless you again!"
INN_SHEA_CONVERSATION04,"You look happy. I can feel a blinding melody from you."
INN_SHEA_CONVERSATION05,"This is the music of the spirits from the forest. Doesn't it make you feel so warm?"
INN_SHEA_GIFT02,"Thank you. Schwanheit will be very happy."
INN_SHEA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Your harmony is full of warmth and comfort."
INN_SHEA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"You might not know, but Shuwanheit is quite the chatty one."
INN_SHEA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Shuwanheit sometimes changes the tone of the music, depending on his mood."
INN_SHEA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Someday, I hope to play your very own song."
INN_SHAMILLA_GREETING02,"Oh, hello. You're back again?"
INN_SHAMILLA_CONVERSATION04,"Why did I hide the fact that I'm a Demon? Haha, wouldn't it be better to not ask such obvious questions?"
INN_SHAMILLA_CONVERSATION05,"Even if it is a well planned scenario, some dramatization is good, too. Hahaha..."
INN_SHAMILLA_GIFT02,"I wanted a different type of present... Haha, but this is good, too."
INN_SHAMILLA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Haha, you'll show me a nice scene today too, right?"
INN_SHAMILLA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"My goal... Haha. Let's say it's to taste something fresh that I've never experienced before."
INN_SHAMILLA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"You're funny. That's why I want to watch you a bit more up close. Hm hm hm!"
INN_SHAMILLA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Ah, that's good. The way you look in peril, trying to fight your fate...!"
INN_KARA_GREETING02,"Hello. Another Master."
INN_KARA_CONVERSATION04,"I'm a weapon. I have no emotions. But..."
INN_KARA_CONVERSATION05,"I wonder what it means to be alive..."
INN_KARA_GIFT02,"Thank you. It will be used to fund the master's research."
INN_KARA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hello. Did you sleep well?"
INN_KARA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I don't understand emotions very well... But I wonder what this feeling is."
INN_KARA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I feel something familiar. Familiar... Is this it?"
INN_KARA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I'm curious what love feels like. I want to know."
INN_CHASE_GREETING02,"Hmm..."
INN_CHASE_CONVERSATION04,"My name... My own name that they call me by... That's why I'll fight for them."
INN_CHASE_CONVERSATION05,"My name is Chase... Chase... My name is Chase now..."
INN_CHASE_GIFT02,"Can I... Take this...? Really...?"
INN_CHASE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I don't see her. If I don't find her soon, Demia will be mad."
INN_CHASE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I felt it with my body. Their power... They probably tried to overpower me without killing me."
INN_CHASE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"She accepted me with such kindness, even though I tried to kill her... She gave me a name... And she stood in front of me..."
INN_CHASE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Demia is scary... Clause is nice, but she's scary sometimes. No matter what, though, she is always kind."
INN_ZAFIR_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Greetings, my desert friend."
INN_ZAFIR_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I like cats... No creature comes even close when it comes to elegance."
INN_ZAFIR_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Even the fierce sand storms in the desert could not leave a scuff on Desert Warriors."
INN_ZAFIR_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I might have his blood flowing in my veins, but I think I have a long way to go to call myself a worthy successor."
INN_ZAFIR_GREETING02,"How have you been?"
INN_ZAFIR_CONVERSATION04,"The prophecy says the resurrection of the God King is near."
INN_ZAFIR_CONVERSATION05,"...If time allows, visit Aegina sometimes. I will be your guide."
INN_ZAFIR_GIFT02,"The Desert Warriors will be happy that you are there as well."
INN_LILIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Good to see you, again!"
INN_LILIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Neraxis? What a jerk. He always begs for my sister's attention!"
INN_LILIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Cain...? Errrgh... I thought he was gone for good. I can't believe he's making a pass at my sister again..."
INN_LILIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I love my sister the most... but I like you as well."
INN_LILIA_GREETING02,"Hello, you look great!"
INN_LILIA_CONVERSATION04,"My sister's mission is mine, too. I will always be with her."
INN_LILIA_CONVERSATION05,"The mystery of endless water? Umm...I heard that it is the power of the First Blue Dragon."
INN_LILIA_GIFT02,"Thank you so much. I will use this for the Shrine of Flow."
INN_LAUDIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Nice to see you. Well, are you here to see me?"
INN_LAUDIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Have you met Lilia and her sister, Laias? They are so great. I am sure you'll like them very much."
INN_LAUDIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I can sense the strong vibration of the Flow and fate, which is only found in true warriors and heroes."
INN_LAUDIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I made a new dance, would you like to see it some time soon? We could even dance together."
INN_LAUDIA_GREETING02,"Hi! Now that we've gotten kind of close, is it okay if I call you by your first name?"
INN_LAUDIA_CONVERSATION04,"I like this place. It's so calm and peaceful."
INN_LAUDIA_CONVERSATION05,"Being a deputy leader is not an easy job. I need to take care of all the people in my tribe."
INN_LAUDIA_GIFT02,"Thank you. I should buy some snacks for the kids..."
INN_ERZE_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I want you to have this to remember me by. It's the tooth of the one who bit me..."
INN_ERZE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Hmm, that woman is still chasing after me... That woman... She... My sister... I miss her... But I also want to kill her... hee hee!"
INN_ERZE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"The one that came up last time. He was giving out his blood to other humans. Our blood is useless without our will in it. That means he was giving his blood by choice... I wonder what he received in return? I should have asked him about it before I killed him."
INN_ERZE_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"No, I'd never go back to how I was like back then. Tee hee, what, do you expect me to give up this thrill I'm feeling and return to those days of despair!? No, never! I won't go back... But... if I did go back... there would only be one reason why I'd do it... Yes... If I ever go back... It would be for her."
INN_ERZE_GREETING02,"I've seen you before... Ah, ha ha. We meet again."
INN_ERZE_CONVERSATION04,"Vampires are nothing like demons. I'll admit those higher demons are decent, but the rest are pretty much worthless."
INN_ERZE_CONVERSATION05,"The blood of the corrupted tastes... It makes me feel ecstatic. Yes, ecstatic!"
INN_ERZE_GIFT02,"You've got some good taste. And you look cuter every time I see you!"
INN_NERAXIS_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"...Fine, I'm glad to see you! Hmpf..."
INN_NERAXIS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Lilia? Ah, that annoying kid? Tsk, she always gets in the way."
INN_NERAXIS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Why won't that mummy get lost? Sometimes I really want to kill him."
INN_NERAXIS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Why do I like Laias? Hmph, y-you don't need a reason to like someone... No, wait! How did you know!?"
INN_NERAXIS_GREETING02,"Hmph, it's you again, human."
INN_NERAXIS_CONVERSATION04,"Huh? You want help? Hmpf. Bothersome."
INN_NERAXIS_CONVERSATION05,"Ha, that's right. Black dragons are the strongest!"
INN_NERAXIS_GIFT02,"I don't need that. Why do you keep...?"
INN_SERIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Ah, Hey... How are you?"
INN_SERIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"All those hellish nights Erze suffered in agony... I failed to do anything for her. Perhaps it was me that made her into what she is now. Yes, it's all my fault..."
INN_SERIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"The most I can do for her is put her soul to rest. There's no other way. Whenever I think of it, I feel my heart breaking all over again... My mind refuses to raise my sword against my sister."
INN_SERIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I... I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for talking to me... listening to me. If we meet again, then..."
INN_SERIA_GREETING02,"Did I not tell you that I don't receive requests?"
INN_SERIA_CONVERSATION04,"I'm here to find someone. I don't have to tell you who it is, do I? ...It's my sister. I'm looking for my sister."
INN_SERIA_CONVERSATION05,"We're bumping into each other quite frequently. Are you here looking for someone yourself? If it's your comrade or family, cherish them..."
INN_SERIA_GIFT02,"... Thank you, I'm just... I'm sorry, and I appreciate it."
INN_LUCIAS_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"May the blessings of the Lua be with you."
INN_LUCIAS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Oh, Stardust is here. They used to visit my hometown at least once a year when I was young. Well, should we go and see if Esker is still around?"
INN_LUCIAS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Sometimes my memories fail me. My past, and the memories of previous Saints of Blessings tend to mix..."
INN_LUCIAS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Holy Knight, Saint... My title does not change what I must do. I simply work to help those struggling with pain and agony."
INN_LUCIAS_GREETING02,"It's a pleasure to have you back. Join me in saying grace before the meal."
INN_LUCIAS_CONVERSATION04,"You wonder if there are Saints other than me, you say? Hmm, I haven't met them, but yes, there are three more."
INN_LUCIAS_CONVERSATION05,"I used to be a flag bearer when I was a Holy Knight. Who would have thought my halidom as a Saint would be a flag as well? Hahaha."
INN_LUCIAS_GIFT02,"It is so generous of you to give me a gift, but I must say it's more than I deserve. If I run into someone in need, may I give this to them?"
INN_CHRISHA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"A decent knight knows when to take it easy. Get some rest."
INN_CHRISHA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Being an Inquisitor reporting directly to His Majesty is not an easy position, but it is one that comes with pride."
INN_CHRISHA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"*Sigh* No high officials and noblemen in the Empire or in Orvelia seem to be trustworthy."
INN_CHRISHA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Why don't you join the Velchia Magic Knights? I'd say you're well qualified."
INN_CHRISHA_GREETING02,"You've come. Is your stomach filled enough to fight?"
INN_CHRISHA_CONVERSATION04,"You ever play any chess?"
INN_CHRISHA_CONVERSATION05,"I definitely would like to talk to the Princess of Orvelia some time."
INN_CHRISHA_GIFT02,"If you insist, I'll accept it."
INN_NIA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"*Sniff* Food... eat together...?"
INN_NIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Is that... meat? Meat... I like. Yummy..."
INN_NIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Demons... tested... my ancestors... turned them... into demonic beasts... Bad..."
INN_NIA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Grrrr... Maybe I like patting on head... a little too much... Heh heh..."
INN_NIA_GREETING02,"*Sniff, sniff* Something smell kind of familiar..."
INN_NIA_CONVERSATION04,"Hunting is...exciting. I can run around... like I want."
INN_NIA_CONVERSATION05,"Bone Mask... material? Heh... That ugly but also cute... with nose... and horn..."
INN_NIA_GIFT02,"This... I don't need... Give me... meat... Huh? I can buy meat?"
INN_LAVRIL_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Heh heh... Glad you're here. What do you want to do today?"
INN_LAVRIL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"People from the Church of Lua are scary, but I know they're not bad people... Heh heh."
INN_LAVRIL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"People like to be friends with fairies and elementals, but... does anyone want to be friends with ghosts..?"
INN_LAVRIL_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Y-you're our friend... Heh heh, we really like you. Please stay with us."
INN_LAVRIL_GREETING02,"Urr... We're here..."
INN_LAVRIL_CONVERSATION04,"W-we're scared... and cold..."
INN_LAVRIL_CONVERSATION05,"Ah... We're lonely... This isn't fair... Who are we...?"
INN_LAVRIL_GIFT02,"Th-thank you. Please don't leave us. Stay with us..."
INN_ESKER_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"My game won't end unless my revenge is complete. I don't care if it ruins me or not.\nThe dice will keep rolling."
INN_ESKER_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I used to fish smelts with him when we were young... Well, I never liked it, anyway.\nI hated baiting the hook with those gross earthworms."
INN_ESKER_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I would teach Ophelia how to shuffle cards after the performance."
INN_ESKER_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"When am I going back to Stardust?\nWell... I'll think about it if you're coming to see the performance."
INN_ESKER_GREETING02,"Hahaha, you've gotten better!\nHow about joining me and earning some real money?"
INN_ESKER_CONVERSATION04,"That Lucias is one stubborn idiot.\nDon't ever tell him that I'm here.\nArgh, thinking about running into him already makes me feel tired…"
INN_ESKER_CONVERSATION05,"The secret gambling house? Hmph, you could never imagine.\nThey won't let you sit at the table unless you bet Vampire blood.\nCome on, don't cry. I'm just messing with you."
INN_ESKER_GIFT02,"Forget the gift and let's grab dinner.\nSilver Catfish Filet spiced up with lemon juice will be perfect."
INN_GLENWYS_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Oh, there you are. Would you like to get something to eat together?"
INN_GLENWYS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Sometimes... I feel I don't deserve the admiration that I see in the eyes of the children from the village."
INN_GLENWYS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I get along well with knights of noble birth. Some would even spar with me."
INN_GLENWYS_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I am always grateful to His Majesty. It's because of His Majesty's grace that a commoner like me could become what I am today."
INN_GLENWYS_GREETING02,"Ah, hello. We meet again."
INN_GLENWYS_CONVERSATION04,"Are you done for the day? How about we train together?"
INN_GLENWYS_CONVERSATION05,"We consider capability more than background in the Empire. Ceaseless effort is the only way to success."
INN_GLENWYS_GIFT02,"I don't deserve a gift like this, but... thank you. I will work hard to return this favor."
INN_MAY_INNIDLE01,"Hmm... Juno's dishes are best...! This will sell like hotcakes!"
INN_MAY_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I've been working hard every day to become the richest girl in Orvel!"
INN_MAY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Today, I'm thinking of traveling all the way to Central Elidora to pick up some new items!"
INN_MAY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Lately, I've picked up making clothes as a hobby. If I get the chance, I'll make something for you too."
INN_MAY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Do you know that there was treasure found in the Aegina Desert?"
INN_MAY_GREETING02,"Ah! Welcome, customer! Oh, wait, this was the Inn…"
INN_MAY_CONVERSATION04,"You will visit my shop too, right?"
INN_MAY_CONVERSATION05,"Juno's food is the best!"
INN_MAY_GIFT02,"Hehehe, thank you!"
INN_GLADI_INNIDLE01,"Hmm, I can still smell the silvervine..."
INN_GLADI_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Hey, you! Come and sit here already!"
INN_GLADI_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Haha! That moment, when my fist crushed my opponent - that was great!"
INN_GLADI_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I'm fast and strong, even by the standards of our tribe. I wonder how they're doing?"
INN_GLADI_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"You're curious why I buy all this Silver Vine even when nobody buys it from me? Well, it's all for personal use!"
INN_GLADI_GREETING02,"Huh? Hey, how's it going?"
INN_GLADI_CONVERSATION04,"This Silver Vine, you know…wow, it smells really good…hahaha!!"
INN_GLADI_CONVERSATION05,"Hey! It's kinda funny, seeing you outside of the arena!"
INN_GLADI_GIFT02,"Whew! You're quite the nice guy, eh?"
INN_VERONICA_INNIDLE01,"Hmm, it's been a while since I just sat back and relaxed."
INN_VERONICA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"I haven't been here in a while...it feels close, and yet so far."
INN_VERONICA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"How are your guild activities going? I will help the best I can."
INN_VERONICA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"I do want to help more, but it isn't easy. I will try harder."
INN_VERONICA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Fufu, I wonder if I can help you on your next raid."
INN_VERONICA_GREETING02,"I hope you will continue to take care of the evil beasts that continue to attack Orvel."
INN_VERONICA_CONVERSATION04,"Rune magic? Hmm, I've learned some at the Tower of Sages. I do also know some Ancient Runes..."
INN_VERONICA_CONVERSATION05,"Guild management isn't easy. There are way too many guilds..."
INN_VERONICA_GIFT02,"Oh, you didn't need to…haah. Well, I thankfully accept."
INN_LOMAN_INNIDLE01,"I just came out during my break. This is a very nice place. I should drop by more often."
INN_LOMAN_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Guarding the monarchy is an important and solemn duty, but sometimes I feel a little jealous of my colleagues since they can come and go as they place."
INN_LOMAN_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"I'll do all I can to repay Her Highness for the trust she has in me."
INN_LOMAN_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Wood carving is an old hobby of mine. Before I realized it, my room became crammed with my woodwork. Haha."
INN_LOMAN_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I saw someone with long hair, just shouting cheers all day long. I can see a lot of funny people who live their lives their own way."
INN_LOMAN_GREETING02,"Come on in. I was working on one of my wood carvings just now, would you like to take a look?"
INN_LOMAN_CONVERSATION04,"My family has guarded the Orvel Monarchy for centuries. When I came to the castle, my father gave me our family heirloom."
INN_LOMAN_CONVERSATION05,"This halberd seems to be pretty special. I asked Jin, and he told me that it holds the essence of some ancient divine beast."
INN_LOMAN_GIFT02,"What? I must tell you, I won't open the vault or labyrinth for you. Ha ha."
INN_JUNO_INNIDLE01,"Welcome! It's break time, though..."
INN_JUNO_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Have you eaten yet? If not, I can recommend a dish!"
INN_JUNO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"Hot spring eggs tastes amazing! It's also one of my favorite simple dishes!"
INN_JUNO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Business is good these days. I feel great!"
INN_JUNO_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"A lot of customers, right? All thanks to you know who, Hahaha."
INN_JUNO_GREETING02,"Come on in! What would you like to have today?"
INN_JUNO_CONVERSATION04,"Just tell me what you want, and I'll cook it right away!"
INN_JUNO_CONVERSATION05,"I have seen so many adventurers, but you strike me as different somehow."
INN_JUNO_GIFT02,"Oh, a tip? Heh heh, thank you."
INN_NICKY_INNIDLE01,"Where have you been wandering? Let's go get some drinks!"
INN_NICKY_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Those who act suspiciously ought to have their faces smashed in, don't you agree?"
INN_NICKY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"How's work? Nothing special. Just smacking anyone who misbehaves."
INN_NICKY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"It's way better here than the somber stockade!"
INN_NICKY_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"Boring Gladi, she hasn't been showing up in the Arena nowadays."
INN_NICKY_GREETING02,"Hey! Why are you meandering around! Come over here!"
INN_NICKY_CONVERSATION04,"I'm starting to grow tired of bullying those monsters."
INN_NICKY_CONVERSATION05,"Is there anyone who can actually put up a good fight? What about you? Let's do it!"
INN_NICKY_GIFT02,"Present? Wow, really?"
INN_DOSARTA_INNIDLE01,"Oh, hello there! What story do you have for me this time?"
INN_DOSARTA_CONNECT_GREETING_MAX,"Oh, human food is really interesting!"
INN_DOSARTA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION01,"So, this is what a human town is like. Heh heh, it's so lively and crowded. I love it!"
INN_DOSARTA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION02,"Snack, snack, snack break! Ah, would you like to have some?"
INN_DOSARTA_CONNECT_CONVERSATION03,"I was a little lonely at the Tower of Challenge, but I'm not anymore!"
INN_DOSARTA_GREETING02,"Ancient Artifacts are really interesting! Are they dangerous? *Giggle* Well, not to me!"
INN_DOSARTA_CONVERSATION04,"Selene can be a bit scary, but she's also really nice and caring!"
INN_DOSARTA_CONVERSATION05,"Oh, thank you! I'll prepare a gift for you next time!"
INN_DOSARTA_GIFT02,"Hehe, Glad to see you again!"
