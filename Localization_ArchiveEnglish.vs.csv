CREATURE_STORY_3,"Cleo's earliest memory begins at the Tower of Sage. Raised by Dominix the Great Sage as an orphan, she is both a genius wizard and a troublemaker. Her inability to control her own power has often led to trouble, including partial destruction of the Red Tower, her own residence. Despite this, her apparent immunity to the wrath of the Great Sage has caused her to be ostracized from her peers. Although this has led her to become selfish and inconsiderate, deep inside, she is still a kindhearted girl who fears abandonment by others."
CREATURE_STORY_4,"He is Cleo's escort and is protecting her at Dominix's request. A former member of a group of assassins, he risked his life and went rogue for some unknown reason.

However, he suddenly disappeared for 10 years. When he returned, he was a completely changed man. His violent Barbarian tendencies were all gone, even when others criticized him. Instead, he now faces them with smiles and jolly laughter. The kind, warm gaze he now shows to children and animals is especially surprising."
CREATURE_STORY_6,"He is the stout and upright king of the Dwarves. He fought alongside the Warrior of the Holy Sword against the Demon Army 100 years ago. His heroism in defeating the Dark Dragon Legion, the core division of the Demon Army, is well known throughout the land. In reality, he only sits on the throne out of a sense of obligation. Even as he complains about the boredom of his royal duties, he continues to work diligently."
CREATURE_STORY_7,"This eccentric albino Goblin enjoys developing powerful weapons more than anything else. Having been harassed and ostracized by other Goblins due to his skin color, he feels no compassion toward his kind. He would gladly shoot, blow up, and smash even a fellow Goblin to test his weapons.

CREATURE_STORY_9,"This playful and bewitching succubus acts on her own whims. As expected of her Demon lineage, she is a hedonist driven by what she finds fun and enjoyable. Even during the Demon War, she chose traveling around on her own over joining the invasion. In her eyes, fighting alongside Kyle was interesting enough for her to even betray her own kind. When she later met Kasel, she gladly joined his party, knowing that she found another fun adventure for herself. When she finds attractive men, she sometimes visits them in their dreams."
CREATURE_STORY_10,"This noble Elven princess admires the Holy Sword and its chosen warrior. She strives as much as she can to do what's right, and wants others to do the same.

Unfortunately, her stout resolve is sometimes taken the wrong way by others. She often visits her younger sister Dosarta at her tower to keep her company."
CREATURE_STORY_11,"Although she was a Holy Maiden of Lua in the past, she eventually fell into corruption. Now, this cynical, crow-commanding witch curses her former Goddess from the darkness.

Nor did she have any grand purpose of experiencing the world outside. She was simply picking flowers, one step at a time. Another step to pick up some frozen branches for her slingshot.

CREATURE_STORY_33,"A mysterious dimension-crossing wizard with distinctly recognizable heterochromia. The perpetual smile on his face seems to come from the wisdom of someone who sees through the entire universe. He shows great interest in those with special abilities and enjoys testing them. His space teleportation ability seems to surpass the realm of mortals, and he can even travel across dimensions. It is unsure what his true motivation is, but it seems certain enough that he always intends to help others."
CREATURE_STORY_34,"A genius technomagi from the Kingdom of Orvelia. She is highly optimistic, and failure never seems to bother her. She dreams of inventing a device that would allow anyone to handle magic one day. She has a magically engineered assistant whom she brought to life after years of research. Following the arrival of the Demons, she incorporated her research into developing weapons that would allow anyone to fight against the invaders."
CREATURE_STORY_35,"Known to some as the Song of the Silver Madness, he is incredibly insincere in everything he does. He shows absolutely no sense of responsibility in regard to those around him. Once he engages in a combat, though, he turns into an untouchable silver wolf that storms across the battlefield. Nothing is known about his past. One thing is certain: he does not distinguish between friend and foe once the madness of battle takes over him. Staying near him when he's in this state may be far more dangerous than holding onto a ticking time bomb."
CREATURE_STORY_36,"A hero who saved countless lives from the Demons, and the current commander of the Holy Knights of the Church of Lua. This brave and seasoned knight has been hunting down Demons all across Orvelia since his younger days. He is also the headmaster of the orphanage where Kasel, Frey, and Clause grew up.

He is preparing to step down from the position due to his age, but his age-defying strength has always led to the denial of his retirement request."
CREATURE_STORY_37,"An assassin of the Laughing Mask, and Roi's colleague. Although she has a physical advantage over Roi as a Half-Elf, she lacks his worldly wisdom and his ability to connect with others, traits that made him crucial in large-scale operations. This has given her something of an inferiority complex. As the 'Cleaner' of the organization, she was tasked with eliminating any traitors. When Roi abandoned the organization, she set out to chase him to figure out his motivation, leaving all her other tasks behind. Her plans after finding him remain to be seen."
CREATURE_STORY_38,"The son of Lucikiel is a powerful Demon officer who brought down the Republic of Gray. Usually considerate and careful, he is actually half Human. In battle, his Demon blood takes over, turning him arrogant and violent. He inherited this power from his father, whom he never even knew. However, he takes pride in his power and does not try to hide it. Since he is only partly Demon, only a single arm undergoes the transformation. However, even just this single arm contains immense power, and it's certainly not easy for him to fully control it yet. If he loses the control of the arm, the only wise decision is to immediately get as far away from him as possible."
CREATURE_STORY_39,"She's the owner of 'Gold Bar,' the biggest and the most luxurious tavern in Vespia. Beneath its flashy exterior, the tavern actually serves as a secret meeting place for the social elites, where invaluable secret information is constantly exchanged. Her natural charm and conversation skills can easily break down personal barriers and win the trust of others. Her true identity is a dealer of secret information and weapons."
CREATURE_STORY_40,"A knight who served the Republic of Gray 100 years ago, and an admirer of Jane Gray. Theo was the First Knight of the Republic and the wielder of the Lightning Legios. During the Duchy's battle against the Demon Army, the Mountain Fortress went on a rampage when its seal was lifted. Under Jane's order, Theo set out to contain it. In his absence, powerful Demon officers attacked the royal palace. Theo returned to fight them despite heavy injury, but was unable to defeat them by himself. When the battle was over, he held the body of the princess in his arms and cried out from the ruins of the palace. Suddenly, a mysterious entity offered him a chance to defend his princess for all eternity. When he accepted, he fell into a deep slumber."
CREATURE_STORY_41,"A practitioner of the medical arts developed when priests were short in supply. She inherited her natural medical talent from her father, but her thirst for knowledge crossed the line when she began researching poison. As a result, she was excommunicated from medical society, but her enthusiasm for research was seemingly unaffected. However, her basic respect for life kept her from achieving any experimental results for her poison research. When the Demons appeared, she became overjoyed at finding rare and precious test subjects."
CREATURE_STORY_42,"He was a mechanic of the royal palace of Orvelia in the distant past. However, he was cursed by the mythical creature Redpur and turned into a Redpur himself.

To give his invention the recognition it deserved, he set out to the empire. On his way, he was cursed by a group of Redpurs who mistook him for a poacher. The curse also affected his watch, giving it a magical power to control the time flow within a living body. Oddy's own time stopped as well."
CREATURE_STORY_43,"A maverick among Demons who seeks to grow her own power by devouring other powerful Demons. She embodies the worst possible meaning of the word Demon. She crossed the dimensional rift to seek out and devour the Demons who traveled to the earthly realm. She placed a limit on her own power and assumed the form of a sickly young girl to further humiliate her victims. She detests weaklings who pretend to be strong. On the other hand, she respects those who recognize their own weaknesses and risk their lives in the pursuit of strength."
CREATURE_STORY_44,"A former officer of Orvelia's armed forces. After a failed attempt to reveal the corruption of military leaders, she was driven out from her position.

As Glenwys swung Maxithea, she always thought that she neither deserved a weapon like Maxithea, her place, nor the excessive praises. \n\nThis was the exact reason why Maxithea chose Glenwys. There was a long-lived myth that Maxithea, the sturdiest shield of the Empire, contained the soul of a guardian taking the form of a blue lion. For a long time, Maxithea had been waiting for someone unprivileged who would always think, and strive to get better at every occasion.\nThe nobles that wielded Maxithea were all privileged from birth, so they did not have to think or strive to grow.\n\nMaxithea wanted someone who could grow stronger by overcoming their fears or concerns like a sword that goes through constant welding and tempering. It did not want someone complete. It wanted someone who has the potential to get better along with itself by overcoming his/her self-doubt and questions. It only asked for Glenwys' determination, and in return, swore to bestow her with greater power and a better future."
