E_C19_Jan_Fray01_01,"I'm back here again... This year, too..."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_02,"I know this won't bring back any of my memories back, but..."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_03,"Aren't you Frey, the one who people call the Priestess of Light?"
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_04,"Grand Elidoran Sage, greetings from the servant of Lua."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_05,"Hahaha, I am well, thanks to you."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_06,"You've already grown into a young lady... you were only a small baby when I first met you."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_07,"A baby? How did you.."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_08,"Didn't Iris tell you?"
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_09,"I am the one who first found you under this World Tree."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_10,"Really..? all I was told was that I was found under the World Tree.."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_11,"It's odd that Iris didn't tell you anything. I can still remember that day like it was yesterday."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_12,"It was an exceptionally warm midwinter day."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_13,"I was walking around the World Tree early in the morning."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_14,"And... there you were, an angel glowing in gold."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_15,"An angel?"
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_16,"An angel indeed! I saw the roots of the World Tree shining with holy light."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_17,"I went straight to it, and there was an adorable baby shining in gold."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_18,"I thought the baby was an angel, but I could see no wings."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_19,"The aura around the baby was not an ordinary one."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_20,"......................................."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_21,"I then reached out to Iris in a hurry."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_22,"I heard that you were brought to the orphanage that the captain of the Holy Knights was running."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_23,"Yes. I was raised by my grandpa Ricardo."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_24,"Clause and Kasel were with me as well."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_25,"But... how come Priestess Iris didn't tell me anything about it?"
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_26,"There must be a reason."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_27,"All that Iris does is done under Lua's guidance."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_28,"I see... Thank you. That was the story that I wanted to hear the most."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_29,"It's the least I could do. I am afraid that I might have confused you on your important day."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_30,"May the light fill... Ah, I believe that humans say it differently."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_31,"Happy birthday, Frey."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_32,"Thank you..."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_33,"..................................................."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_34,"I don't mean to complain."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_35,"But... who am I, Lua...?"
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_36,"...I'm back again."
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_37,"Will I be able to meet you again...?"
E_C19_Jan_Fray01_38,"I will find you, no matter how much you have changed."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_01,"...Roi, you're still good at covering up your traces."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_02,"But you won't be able to fool me."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_03,"…"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_04,"Why did you leave, Roi...?"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_05,"You left without a single word..."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_06,"A few years ago"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_07,"*Huff, huff* They just won't give up!"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_08,"Kuh...!"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_09,"*Groan*"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_10,"How's the wound?"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_11,"...It's just a scratch."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_12,"Just wipe off the blood with this."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_13,"…"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_14,"Do you think I like helping you?"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_15,"Remember, we're in a joint operation."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_16,"A loss of a team member can compromise the entire mission."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_17,"Hmph, don't get all bossy here."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_18,"I did most of the work to earn us our name."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_19,"Everyone knows that you're a great assassin."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_20,"Things go wrong sometimes. Just like today."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_21,"Stop the bleeding and leave. I'll cover up the traces."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_22,"That's an order."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_23,"You're not going to stop mentioning that you're the boss, huh?"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_24,"And I don't need your handkerchief. Take it back."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_25,"Then, just throw it away when you get back."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_26,"And get some rest. It's your birthday."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_27,"...How did you?"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_28,"Why is this memory coming back...?"
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_29,"This weird feeling that I've been getting recently..."
E_C19_Jan_Tanya01_30,"It's all because of you, Roi!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_01,"Same thing, different day, huh?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_02,"Tell me about it. It's his…"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_03,"It's his birthday after all."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_04,"I heard birthday is a special day."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_05,"Isn't everyone supposed to celebrate?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_06,"Umm... We are, but I'm afraid"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_07,"Loman might not like us making a big deal about it."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_08,"Come on, he's a brusque fellow, but I doubt he'll say no to a birthday celebration."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_09,"Last time, I wanted to buy a present for the princess and asked him for a discount."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_10,"He wouldn't even listen to me. He told me I shouldn't mix business with pleasure."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_11,"Umm... I think he was right on that one..."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_12,"I was short on money, so I asked him one more time a bit aggressively."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_13,"Then, he raised his spear at me. Loman and I fought till it became dark. It was really fun."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_14,"...Loman might have his faults, but you're just as bad as he is."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_15,"Alright! Loman is a comrade in arms. I'm going to go start the celebration."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_16,"Wait!!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_17,"Um? Aren't you that (poor) entourage of Her Highness Princess?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_18,"Loman! Happy Birthda..."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_19,"Are you out of your mind? Her Highness has left the castle! What are you doing here?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_20,"Don't you know it's dangerous out there?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_21,"(A while later)"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_22,"I couldn't even finish my first sentence. He told me off..."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_23,"*Sigh* We told you so."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_24,"You guys seem to know nothing about Loman."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_25,"He likes everything to be done by the book!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_26,"Just don't give him a reason to pick on you! Let me handle this."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_27,"?????"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_28,"Hey, Loman! How's everything?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_29,"Oh, Clause! Long time, no see. What are you...?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_30,"Ah! I've just wiped out some demons in the forest."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_31,"I've done my duty for today!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_32,"Good to hear that. My shift is almost over as well."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_33,"Oh? Then, shall we go to Juno's and have a drink?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_34,"It's your birthday, too! You're off tomorrow, aren't you?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_35,"It's quite surprising that you remember my birthday."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_36,"Haha, thank you!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_37,"Of course I do! Drinks are on me today. Pack your stuff!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_38,"I will, but in 3 minutes and 30 seconds."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_39,"No, I should add 5 more minutes to make up for the time we talked."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_40,"Yeah? I'll wait outside, then. Come out when you're ready."
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_41,"What are you doing? Let's go, guys!"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_42,"Whoa... Just like that?"
E_C19_Jan_Loman01_43,"There was a reason people spoke so highly of him."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_01,"Welcome to May's... Oh, my!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_02,"It's Lady Aisha!!!!!!!!!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_03,"Were you able to prepare what I asked you?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_04,"Sure, I did! Just as you ordered!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_05,"My lady, you could have just told me if you needed anything."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_06,"No! Don't do anything today, Priscilla!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_07,"No questions. Just listen to me!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_08,"Don't worry, we'll start easy!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_09,"What is going on...?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_10,"Tada! How do you like it, my lady?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_11,"Hmm... The main color doesn't really go well with her eyes."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_12,"Then, what about this exotic one?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_13,"What continent is this from...? Haha..."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_14,"It's a little too soon, but what about this fancy swimsuit?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_15,"A little too soon? It's winter now!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_16,"Hahaha..."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_17,"I saved the best one for the last. How do you like this?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_18,"Wow! Priscilla, you look gorgeous!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_19,"This! Let's get this! What do you think?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_20,"My lady, wouldn't fancy clothes keep me from..."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_21,"Hey, didn't I tell you? No questions!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_22,"Hmm, I thought I could ask my lady for a favor for my birthday..."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_23,"Huh? I-I mean... The clothes are your birthday gift!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_24,"Do you not like it...?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_25,"I sure do. This is the prettiest dress I've ever worn in my life."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_26,"But clothes like this can get in the way when I have to protect you."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_27,"I'm not saying you have to wear it all the time!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_28,"You can wear it for our tea breaks. Please?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_29,"You're always so good to me, Priscilla. I wanted to give you something, too."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_30,"Ha ha, you give me more than you have to, my lady."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_31,"Huh? What did I give you?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_32,"Every moment I am with you is a gift."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_33,"So, this fancy dress can wait until some other time."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_34,"*Sigh* Okay, okay. If you say so."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_35,"I'm sorry, May. We'll come back. Let's go, Priscilla!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_36,"Yes, my lady. How about afternoon tea with that rose-scented blend from the East?"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_37,"Yeah! I love the tea that you brew!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_38,"And Happy Birthday, Priscilla!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_39,"Thank you, my lady!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_40,"I'm here, too, you know..."
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_41,"But you're our loyal customer!"
E_C19_Jan_Priscilla01_42,"Happy birthday! Please come again!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_01,"Hey! Any luck?"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_02,"No, nothing yet."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_03,"I swear I saw her coming down this way."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_04,"Let's look around a little bit more!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_05,"Phew, they're gone, finally!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_06,"Since when did I start hiding on my birthday...?"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_07,"Ah, yes. It all started that day..."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_08,"Three years ago"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_09,"Hmm?"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_10,"Attention!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_11,"It's Captain's birthday today! Let's celebrate together!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_12,"Happy birthday, ma'am!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_13,"Congratulations, ma'am!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_14,"It's Captain's birthday! Gather up and celebrate!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_15,"Congratulations, ma'am!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_16,"Happy birthday, ma'am!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_17,"Hahaha... Thank you all."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_18,"We knew you'd like it, ma'am."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_19,"You'll never feel lonely on your birthday, ma'am. We'll all celebrate your birthday every year."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_20,"Happy birthday, Captain!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_21,"Haha... Thank you."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_22,"I should have known these guys would let things get out of hand..."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_23,"It's just a birthday, not a national holiday or something..."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_24,"Found her! Captain's here!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_25,"Princess! Clause! Loman! We've spotted Captain!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_26,"Urgh!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_27,"There you are, Demia."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_28,"Happy birthday. The entire nation is lucky to have you."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_29,"You're very generous with your compliments, Your Highness."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_30,"There you were, Captain! We were looking everywhere for you."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_31,"Let's begin Captain's birthday celebration!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_32,"Gather around!"
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_33,"Hahaha... Thank you, all."
E_C19_Jan_Demia01_34,"It seems I'm stuck here... again..."
