CONVERSATION_TU_256,"I've come to quit being a squire. What procedures do we have to follow?"
CONVERSATION_TU_257,"I'm sorry, but all personnel matters related to the squire class have been suspended."
CONVERSATION_TU_258,"Excuse me? Then what about all the squires that were left behind?"
CONVERSATION_TU_259,"We will regroup once the situation stabilizes."
CONVERSATION_TU_260,"Current conditions? What in the world is happening?"
CONVERSATION_TU_261,"We found a vault in the basement of the royal palace."
CONVERSATION_TU_262,"It holds many treasures, but all the monsters are causing an issue."
CONVERSATION_TU_263,"The Royal Palace ordered all work in the royal palace to be stopped,"
CONVERSATION_TU_264,"and asked us to put all our efforts toward taking care of the monsters down below."
CONVERSATION_TU_265,"If you kill the monsters, you can receive a reward from the Palace."
CONVERSATION_TU_266,"We encourage you to participate."
CONVERSATION_TU_267,"Let's see. How many more days do I have left till the end of my service?"
CONVERSATION_TU_268,"Seven years till I leave..!! Wahoo!!"
CONVERSATION_TU_269,"The first year felt like forever…"
CONVERSATION_TU_270,"It's already been 13 years now. I can't believe it!"
CONVERSATION_TU_271,"An ancient tower? How interesting!"
CONVERSATION_TU_272,"Wow, humans! You're humans, right?"
CONVERSATION_TU_273,"I never thought I could see one in my whole life!!"
CONVERSATION_TU_274,"Please stop rubbernecking us."
CONVERSATION_TU_275,"My bad! Please, excuse me."
CONVERSATION_TU_276,"It's just been so boring, sitting around alone for the past 13 years…"
CONVERSATION_TU_277,"Even my friends and family never came by to chat."
CONVERSATION_TU_278,"I was too excited to meet actual, speaking people!"
CONVERSATION_TU_279,"Have you been doing well, Dosarta?"
CONVERSATION_TU_280,"Sister!? I can't believe I get to meet you alongside humans!"
CONVERSATION_TU_281,"It's like I've received a day off!"
CONVERSATION_TU_282,"Sister...?"
CONVERSATION_TU_283,"Are you a princess of the elves, too?"
CONVERSATION_TU_284,"Yes. As members of the Elven Royal Family, we guard the Tower of Challenges in shifts, taking turns every 20 years."
CONVERSATION_TU_285,"Wow. Twenty years. That's like forever."
CONVERSATION_TU_286,"So…that'd be 2 years for humans."
CONVERSATION_TU_287,"Dosarta, I'd like to introduce you to the Hero of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_TU_288,"Are you serious?! You used to love the stories about the holy sword as a child!"
CONVERSATION_TU_289,"Wait… then that means…"
CONVERSATION_TU_290,"Yes. It's time to open the Tower of Challenge."
CONVERSATION_TU_291,"Then, these guys will keep visiting this place!"
CONVERSATION_TU_292,"I won't be bored anymore!!"
CONVERSATION_TU_293,"We are probably the luckiest elves alive!"
CONVERSATION_TU_294,"You got to meet the Hero of the Holy Sword that you used to dream of, and I won't be bored anymore at work!!"
CONVERSATION_TU_295,"I guess so."
CONVERSATION_TU_296,"Would you explain the Tower of Challenge to the Hero?"
CONVERSATION_TU_297,"Okay, I'll start."
CONVERSATION_TU_298,"The Tower of Challenge was built before history was even recorded."
CONVERSATION_TU_299,"We don't know which race discovered the tower first."
CONVERSATION_TU_300,"But we do know that the tower came to be called the Tower of Challenge due to the endless number of challengers to reach the top."
CONVERSATION_TU_301,"These challengers discovered powerful artifacts that were sealed within the tower."
CONVERSATION_TU_302,"The news spread quickly,"
CONVERSATION_TU_303,"and many more entered the Tower of Challenge to discover other artifacts."
CONVERSATION_TU_304,"However,"
CONVERSATION_TU_305,"the artifacts were cursed…"
CONVERSATION_TU_306,"by a curse that amplified the desires of any creature that touched them!"
CONVERSATION_TU_307,"In the Tower, rumbles broke out among those who wanted to possess more artifacts."
CONVERSATION_TU_308,"They say it was true mayhem, with some running around shrieking, 'My precious'!"
CONVERSATION_TU_309,"Eventually, all of the artifacts were destroyed,"
CONVERSATION_TU_310,"and those who lost their minds over the artifacts never left the Tower."
CONVERSATION_TU_311,"Scary."
CONVERSATION_TU_312,"My Family finally decided to restrict access to the Tower of Challenge."
CONVERSATION_TU_313,"We locked the gates and no one was permitted to enter afterwards."
CONVERSATION_TU_314,"Members of the Royal Family guarded the Tower of Challenge in rotation."
CONVERSATION_TU_315,"When the demons invaded a century ago,"
CONVERSATION_TU_316,"King Kyle of Orvelia came to the Tower of Challenge,"
CONVERSATION_TU_317,"requesting access because he needed strong powers to defeat the demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_318,"He took back the pieces of artifacts from the insane who were still calling for their 'precious',"
CONVERSATION_TU_319,"and put the pieces back together."
CONVERSATION_TU_320,"Wasn't Kyle cursed by touching the artifact?"
CONVERSATION_TU_321,"Upon putting together the artifacts, an analysis took place,"
CONVERSATION_TU_322,"and it revealed that when the artifacts had been destroyed, the curse too had disappeared."
CONVERSATION_TU_323,"And the curse will not return, even if those artifacts become whole?"
CONVERSATION_TU_324,"The analysis implied that the curse only worked while the artifact was inside the Tower of Challenge."
CONVERSATION_TU_325,"While it is believed that no artifacts remain whole as of now, we cannot be sure."
CONVERSATION_TU_326,"Since those undying cursed ones are still too dangerous,"
CONVERSATION_TU_327,"we have locked the gate of the Tower and watched over it."
CONVERSATION_TU_328,"But now, things are different. The holy sword showed up, which is a signal that the world is in danger."
CONVERSATION_TU_329,"Therefore, we are opening the gate today, allowing you to challenge the Tower."

CONVERSATION_SURPRISE,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_FLINCH,"…!"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_51,"About a century ago, a wizard opened the Demon's Gate"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_52,"and allowed demons to invade the entire continent."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_53,"The Dark Lord Angmund"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_54,"proclaimed himself King of the World"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_55,"and left the world covered in blood, tears, and screams."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_56,"But the righteous marched forth towards the Dark Lord's fortress,\n\nwading through pain and despair."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_57,"These heroes were King Kyle of Orvelia,\n\nthe last kingdom of humans, and his brave companions."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_58,"A fierce battle raged in front of Angmund's fortress."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_59,"While his companions they desperately fought off the Dark Forces,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_60,"Kyle walked into the Dark Lord's castle alone"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_61,"and stabbed Angmund's heart with the Holy Sword Aea."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_62,"Only the Holy Sword remained."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_63,"There was no trace of Kyle or Angmund."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_64,"Without their lord, the demons quickly weakened,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_65,"and the war ended in victory\n\nfor the people of the land."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_66,"By the time peace was restored to the continent\n\nand the wounds of the old war had started to fade,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_67,"an unknown darkness creeped around the Holy Sword Aea."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_68,"The heroes who fought alongside Kyle,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_69,"sealed the Holy Sword Aea inside the World Tree\n\nthat Lua, the Goddess of Light, had blessed"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_70,"and prayed for everlasting protection from the Darkness."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_71,"Now, a hundred years have passed after the Demon's Gate opened."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_72,"and the traces of war had long since disappeared in Orvelia, the kingdom of humans."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_73,"Although humankind believed this peace would continue for a long time,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_74,"a shroud of darkness\n\nhad already begun to creep in around the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_75,"Iris, the Great Priestess of the Lua Order,"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_76,"sensed the feeble spirit of Angmund"
CONVERSATION_INTRO_77,"who everyone thought had disappeared for good."
CONVERSATION_INTRO_78,"So, the Kingdom of Orvelia sent an expedition to investigate the situation."
CONVERSATION_5000,"I was so close to becoming a full-fledged knight. Why now!?"
CONVERSATION_5001,"Haha. Are you feeling bad because you can't join the expedition?"
CONVERSATION_5002,"I'm proud of you, little brother. Look how brave you are even though you are just a squire."
CONVERSATION_5003,"It's not that I feel bad. I want to go with you because I am worried!"
CONVERSATION_5004,"Apparently this is the biggest expedition since the war against the Dark Forces! Something big must be coming!"
CONVERSATION_5005,"Hahaha. A squire worrying about an expedition of Royal Knights!"
CONVERSATION_5006,"If the senior knights hear you, their pride will be bruised. Keep that up and you'll find yourself getting another noogie."
CONVERSATION_5007,"I would put up with a lot of noogies just to go with you."
CONVERSATION_5008,"As a Royal Knight, I'll tell you again, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5009,"We have to trust our team,"
CONVERSATION_5010,"just as our former King Kyle and his companions did when they saved the world."
CONVERSATION_5011,"Okay. A squire has to trust the expedition and do his work here."
CONVERSATION_5012,"Now, straighten those shoulders, Kasel. You will be a full-fledged knight soon enough."
CONVERSATION_5013,"You will definitely do important things for our homeland someday,"
CONVERSATION_5014,"and I will be there with you."
CONVERSATION_5015,"Who are you and why are you speaking so earnestly? You're scaring me."
CONVERSATION_5016,"Well, let's just say I'm an inspirational man. Hahaha."
CONVERSATION_5017,"Haha. I wouldn't call that very inspirational."
CONVERSATION_5018,"That's right. Just keep smiling like that. I promise to return safely after we complete the mission."
CONVERSATION_5019,"For the honor of the Royal Knights of Orvelia!"
CONVERSATION_5020,"I will await your safe return."
CONVERSATION_2302,"28 Days Later…"
CONVERSATION_5021,"I've been waiting so long, but still no news from the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5022,"Ominous rumors are swirling that this expedition was not a simple investigation,"
CONVERSATION_5023,"but a fight against the Demons that have reappeared."
CONVERSATION_5024,"I cannot wait any longer."
CONVERSATION_5025,"I have to go."
CONVERSATION_5026,"If it's really the Demons that they are up against,"
CONVERSATION_5027,"I have to help Clause."
CONVERSATION_5028,"The expedition was headed south, and then east."
CONVERSATION_5029,"If I follow that path, I will definitely catch up to them."
CONVERSATION_5030,"Kasel, where are you going?"
CONVERSATION_5031,"F-Frey… You're supposed to be at the temple…"
CONVERSATION_5032,"Today is my day off!"
CONVERSATION_5033,"I will come with you if you are leaving to find Clause!"
CONVERSATION_5034,"How did you know...?"
CONVERSATION_5035,"I would do the same if I was in your place, wielding a sword."
CONVERSATION_5036,"Yeah, Frey. But you can't come with me. It's too dangerous for an apprentice priestess like you. As you said, you're just a priestess without a sword."
CONVERSATION_5037,"There is no news from the expedition. We don't know what's going on out there."
CONVERSATION_5038,"Hah! Kasel, do you have any idea what priests do?"
CONVERSATION_5039,"It's dangerous for priests to go on expeditions on their own."
CONVERSATION_5040,"But don't you realize it's also dangerous for anyone to leave on an expedition without a priest?"
CONVERSATION_5041,"But…"
CONVERSATION_5042,"You can't tell me not to come, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5043,"You're not the only one who is worried about Clause."
CONVERSATION_5044,"And, if you also do not return..."
CONVERSATION_5045,"I would be even more devastated than you are now."
CONVERSATION_5046,"I'm sorry, Frey. How thoughtless of me."
CONVERSATION_5047,"Let's go find him together, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5048,"But we have to be careful. We don't know what dangers are lurking about."
CONVERSATION_5049,"Frey, you must leave the temple today."
CONVERSATION_5050,"Great Priestess, what do you mean? Have I done something wrong?"
CONVERSATION_5051,"No. You have a mission."
CONVERSATION_5052,"If there is something you need me to do, please tell me."
CONVERSATION_5053,"Follow your heart, and go where it tells you to go."
CONVERSATION_5054,"My heart longs to serve Lua, the Goddess of Light."
CONVERSATION_5055,"I know how deep your faith is, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5056,"And I can also see the concern deep inside your eyes."
CONVERSATION_5058,"Lua will guide you down your path,"
CONVERSATION_5059,"but it will be a path filled with hardship."
CONVERSATION_5060,"Hardship? Is that what Clause is going through…"
CONVERSATION_5061,"You will be able to meet him at the entrance to the capital, outside the temple."
CONVERSATION_5062,"You must help him so he does not succumb to the Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5063,"Kasel's path will be full of hardships…"
CONVERSATION_5064,"Will I be able to follow the righteous path?"
CONVERSATION_5065,"What crown of thorns is Kasel fated to bear? He is just a squire…"
CONVERSATION_5066,"Frey! Have you changed your mind? Okay, I'll be back soon!"
CONVERSATION_5067,"Wait, Kasel! I'm coming!"
CONVERSATION_5068,"Oh Goddess Lua, please protect Clause and Kasel"
CONVERSATION_5069,"and guide us by lighting our way."
CONVERSATION_5070,"We've been walking for more than half a day, but we still have a ways to go to catch up to the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5071,"We will catch them soon enough, Kasel. Don't worry too much."
CONVERSATION_2356,"Go back, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2357,"*Sigh*…"
CONVERSATION_2358,"Let's go back, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_2359,"The people at the Tower are worried about you."
CONVERSATION_2360,"Aaaaaaaaaah! Come on!"
CONVERSATION_2361,"It's not that I don't understand how you feel, but"
CONVERSATION_2362,"I also have a job to do."
CONVERSATION_2363,"I'll be in a difficult predicament if I don't bring you back."
CONVERSATION_2364,"Idiot! Jerk! Go back! I told you, go back!!~~"
CONVERSATION_2367,"Excuse me, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_2368,"I think someone's trying to get your attention, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2369,"Huh? Me?"
CONVERSATION_2370,"Please help me! He's a pervert!"
CONVERSATION_2371,"Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_2372,"Kasel! Did you hear that? A pervert! We have to help her!"
CONVERSATION_2373,"…What a headache."
CONVERSATION_2374,"Just putting this out there, this is a misunderstanding."
CONVERSATION_2375,"So, just walk away, okay? It's none of your business."
CONVERSATION_2376,"Eeeek! Help me!"
CONVERSATION_2377,"Look, I, uh, don't know who you are, but..."
CONVERSATION_2378,"Step away from the lady!"
CONVERSATION_2380,"*Sigh*…"
CONVERSATION_2381,"Look around, you three."
CONVERSATION_2382,"… Oh no! A pack of wolves!"
CONVERSATION_2383,"Your screaming must have attracted them."
CONVERSATION_2384,"Well, we have no choice now."
CONVERSATION_2385,"Pervert or not, we have to deal with this first."
CONVERSATION_2386,"I guess we have no choice. I'll lead the way!"
CONVERSATION_2387,"Argh!"
CONVERSATION_2388,"Those doggies can't read the mood!"
CONVERSATION_2389,"Everyone, be careful!"
CONVERSATION_2390,"Is it over now?"
CONVERSATION_2392,"Don't get too comfortable just yet. Stay alert!"
CONVERSATION_2393,"Eek! There's more!"
CONVERSATION_2394,"There's a big one."
CONVERSATION_2395,"Looks like he's the head of the pack."
CONVERSATION_5595,"So, killing him will clear the rest?"
CONVERSATION_5596,"I guess so."
CONVERSATION_5597,"Who would've thought a pack of wolves, so close to town..."
CONVERSATION_5598,"Many of the watch were drafted into the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5599,"I'm going back in. Be careful, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5072,"What a relief we found the wolves before they got us first, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5073,"We would've been dead if it weren't for this guy."
CONVERSATION_5074,"But he's a pervert."
CONVERSATION_5075,"Look, Miss. You can't go around misjudging a perfectly normal person like me."
CONVERSATION_2406,"I'm Cleo's bodyguard, not a pervert."
CONVERSATION_2407,"Am I not, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_2408,"Don't be fooled by his words!"
CONVERSATION_2409,"Cleo…"
CONVERSATION_2410,"What if I had aimed my blade at that knight because of you, huh?"
CONVERSATION_2411,"Just stop it."
CONVERSATION_2412,"Let's go back, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_2413,"Humph! I'm NOT going back!"
CONVERSATION_2414,"I've made myself very clear!"
CONVERSATION_2415,"I'm not playing around this time."
CONVERSATION_2416,"I…"
CONVERSATION_2417,"Yes, yes. I know."
CONVERSATION_2418,"You have clues to find…"
CONVERSATION_2419,"E-excuse me?"
CONVERSATION_2420,"I still don't know what's going on between you two, and I can see you're not a pervert,"
CONVERSATION_2421,"but we need to be on our way."
CONVERSATION_2422,"Sorry, we really thought you were a pervert.."
CONVERSATION_2423,"Cleo…"
CONVERSATION_2424,"Time to apologize. Now."
CONVERSATION_2425,"Humph!"
CONVERSATION_5076,"Haha. You don't have to apologize."
CONVERSATION_5077,"I'm sorry we misjudged you."
CONVERSATION_5078,"Did you say your name was Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5079,"I don't know what clues you are looking for, but I will pray for you."
CONVERSATION_5080,"But this guy is worried about you..."
CONVERSATION_5081,"What was your name again, Sir?"
CONVERSATION_5082,"My name is Roi. I'm not worried about her. It's merely my job to escort her…."
CONVERSATION_5083,"Right. You don't want Mr. Roi, who's so worried about you, to get in trouble now, do you?"
CONVERSATION_2430,"Uhhh…"
CONVERSATION_2431,"I'm sorry I put you in danger.."
CONVERSATION_2432,"Huh? What did you say, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_2433,"Did you just say you're sorry?"
CONVERSATION_2434,"But,"
CONVERSATION_2435,"I'm never going back, Roi."
CONVERSATION_2436,"Even if you drag me back,"
CONVERSATION_2437,"I'll escape again and again. A million times if I have to. I have something I must do!"
CONVERSATION_5084,"Cleo... That's..."
CONVERSATION_5085,"Which way are you headed? The direction you were coming from tells me you just left Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5086,"Cleo, stop cutting me off..."
CONVERSATION_5087,"Right! You were coming from the opposite direction."
CONVERSATION_5088,"Did you happen to run into an expedition group from Orvel?"
CONVERSATION_5089,"You guys! Stop!! Can we take turns speaking?"
CONVERSATION_5090,"Sorry! We are looking for a group that was dispatched from Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5091,"It's been almost a month, but we haven't heard anything from them yet."
CONVERSATION_5092,"Hmm.. Seems like someone from your family was part of the expedition."
CONVERSATION_5093,"Yes, my brother."
CONVERSATION_5094,"Kasel and I grew up with him in the same orphanage…"
CONVERSATION_5095,"Hmm…"
CONVERSATION_5096,"Come to think of it, we did see traces of a camp along the way."
CONVERSATION_5097,"Right. I saw it, too! It could've been traces of the expedition camp."
CONVERSATION_5098,"Why don't you come with us! We will take you there!"
CONVERSATION_5099,"Since when did you become so nice..."
CONVERSATION_5100,"I see…So this is a warmth she never felt at the Tower of the Sage…"
CONVERSATION_5101,"I should suggest hiring a priest once we get back."
CONVERSATION_5102,"When we.. what? What are you mumbling about?"
CONVERSATION_5103,"Uh…"
CONVERSATION_5104,"I'm telling you, I am not going back. Go back on your own, if you are so eager!"
CONVERSATION_5105,"I'll stay with these guys. They need my help!"
CONVERSATION_5106,"*Sigh*…"
CONVERSATION_5107,"Fine. If you want to help someone for the first time in your life..."
CONVERSATION_2466,"Let us accompany you for a while, Mister Knight."
CONVERSATION_2467,"I have my reasons, too."
CONVERSATION_2468,"What? Roi?"
CONVERSATION_2469,"I made an oath to the Tower of the Sage. I can't just abandon it."
CONVERSATION_5108,"Thanks! When I find my brother, I will return the favor."
CONVERSATION_5109,"Good for you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2472,"Let me properly introduce myself."
CONVERSATION_5110,"My name is Cleo, and I'm a sorceress from the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2474,"I…"
CONVERSATION_5111,"I'm from the Tower of the Sage, too. I'm escorting this kid."
CONVERSATION_2476,"The name is Roi."
CONVERSATION_2477,"I'm Kasel, a squire of Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_2478,"My name is Frey. I'm a disciple of Iris, the Great Priestess."
CONVERSATION_5112,"And.. you are both apprentices?"
CONVERSATION_5113,"Why do you seem so surprised, Roi? Are you looking down on them for being apprentices?"
CONVERSATION_5114,"Quite the opposite. I was surprised by their competence."
CONVERSATION_5115,"Haha. You were?"
CONVERSATION_5116,"That priestess really knows how to calm Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5117,"Her talent for influencing people is considerable. Very useful. Fufufu…"
CONVERSATION_5118,"Why is he looking at Frey with that wicked grin on his face?"
CONVERSATION_5119,"H-he's not really a pervert, is he, Miss Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5120,"That's nonsense."
CONVERSATION_5121,"Haha. Roi may not make a great impression, but I promise he's not the type to molest people."
CONVERSATION_5122,"But, hmm... a man would definitely look at you with a wicked smile… hmm..."
CONVERSATION_5123,"It's impolite to stare at a specific part of someone's body like that."
CONVERSATION_5123_GF,"It's impolite to stare at a specific part of someone's body like that."
CONVERSATION_5124,"What? You fool! This misunderstanding started all because of your wicked smile!"
CONVERSATION_5125,"No, it started because you treated me like a pervert."
CONVERSATION_5126,"Um.. Excuse me? Could you please stop arguing so we can get going?"
CONVERSATION_5127,"I'm sorry to rush you, especially since you are helping us, but we really have to go now."
CONVERSATION_5128,"Oh, you're right! Let's get going!"
CONVERSATION_2483,"Wow, what are those?"
CONVERSATION_2484,"Slimes! Aren't they adorable?"
CONVERSATION_2485,"Adorable?"
CONVERSATION_2486,"I tried to breed a slime at home once,"
CONVERSATION_2487,"but the whole bottle just melted…"
CONVERSATION_2488,"And I had to clean it up."
CONVERSATION_2489,"Roi! That's the reason why girls don't like you! You're so petty!"
CONVERSATION_2490,"You two seem very close!"
CONVERSATION_2491,"Says who!"
CONVERSATION_5129,"Why is he examining that slime so carefully?"
CONVERSATION_5130,"Kasel has finally discovered how charming slimes can be!!"
CONVERSATION_5131,"The weapons embedded in the slime… I was checking to see if they belonged to our knights or to another expedition from Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5132,"Thankfully, they do not."
CONVERSATION_5133,"You misread the mood here, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5134,"Oh no. I apologize if I embarrassed you."
CONVERSATION_5135,"That's right, Miss Cleo. Kasel was just a little worried….."
CONVERSATION_5136,"See, Roi?"
CONVERSATION_5137,"Hah… I guess this time it was me."
CONVERSATION_5137_0,"It's all right, Mr. Roi. I guess you said it out of consideration for Kasel's feelings."
CONVERSATION_5137_1,"I'm fine. It might be better if I treat Cleo the way you guys do."
CONVERSATION_5137_2,"Excuse me? What did I do?"
CONVERSATION_5137_3,"At this rate, this argument will never end. Are you done observing the slime, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5137_4,"Yes. I am ready now."
CONVERSATION_2507,"What kind of slime is that?"
CONVERSATION_2508,"It's a giant slime!"
CONVERSATION_2509,"I've never seen a slime that big before."
CONVERSATION_2510,"I really want to keep it!"
CONVERSATION_5138,"Roi, could you please bring that slime back to the Tower of the Sage later?"
CONVERSATION_2512,"Nope."
CONVERSATION_2513,"It looks like we will have to get rid of it before we can go any further."
CONVERSATION_2514,"Then let's slash it down."
CONVERSATION_2515,"Don't kill it, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2516,"I don't think he's listening.."
CONVERSATION_2517,"Humph! Stupid Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2518,"Roi, you idiot! Why did you kill it!?"
CONVERSATION_5139,"Hmm. Just as I expected. Slimes are a little hard to cut."
CONVERSATION_5140,"Oh. I'm sorry, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5141,"Is this also your first time seeing such an enormous slime, Miss Cleo and Mr. Roi?"
CONVERSATION_5142,"Yeah! Who in the world created..."
CONVERSATION_5143,"such an enormous slime?"
CONVERSATION_5144,"Perhaps, the rumors…"
CONVERSATION_5145,"What rumors?"
CONVERSATION_5146,"Oh, the one about the demons having appeared again?"
CONVERSATION_5147,"Have you heard the rumors, too, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5148,"Briefly at Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5149,"I could've heard more if that stupid Roi hadn't chased after me."
CONVERSATION_5150,"I never knew such rumors were being spread."
CONVERSATION_5151,"If the rumors are true, I doubt the demons would be wasting their time making slime..."
CONVERSATION_5152,"The slime might not have been made by anyone."
CONVERSATION_5153,"They could have been affected by the magic and grown big on their own."
CONVERSATION_5154,"Whatever the case, this is abnormal."
CONVERSATION_5155,"I hope everything is okay with Clause…"
CONVERSATION_2536,"Ew, spiders…"
CONVERSATION_2537,"How can you say that about spiders when you love slime so much?"
CONVERSATION_2538,"You're so unpredictable."
CONVERSATION_2539,"They're gross!"
CONVERSATION_2540,"Look at those legs!"
CONVERSATION_2541,"And what about those eyes!"
CONVERSATION_2542,"Those bloodsucking spiders are quite good when they're cooked!"
CONVERSATION_2543,"You eat those things?!"
CONVERSATION_2544,"Uh, you've never tried them before?"
CONVERSATION_2545,"This is the first time I've heard they're edible."
CONVERSATION_2546,"My teacher used to make me barbecued spider legs after our training sessions."
CONVERSATION_2547,"Teacher?"
CONVERSATION_2548,"…"
CONVERSATION_2549,"Um, we should talk about this later."
CONVERSATION_2550,"I think those spiders have spotted us."
CONVERSATION_2551,"Ewww! Don't come this way! I'll burn all of you!"
CONVERSATION_2552,"Please don't overcook them!"
CONVERSATION_2553,"Are you really gonna eat them…"
CONVERSATION_2554,"Ewww! There are too many!"
CONVERSATION_2555,"I should burn them all at once!"
CONVERSATION_2556,"Yay! Good riddance!"
CONVERSATION_2557,"You almost burned us, too."
CONVERSATION_2558,"She doesn't know how to control herself…"
CONVERSATION_2559,"But that was great!"
CONVERSATION_2560,"All those spiders at once…"
CONVERSATION_2561,"Kasel, watch out!"
CONVERSATION_2562,"Kasel! Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_2563,"Eek! A spider THAT BIG?!"
CONVERSATION_2564,"Luckily, he just passed out. He should be okay."
CONVERSATION_2565,"It's not really my style to be out in front, but I guess I don't have a choice."
CONVERSATION_2566,"Not bad for a spider."
CONVERSATION_2567,"Let's see if it can still get me."
CONVERSATION_2568,"Amazing! He's dodging all of its attacks!"
CONVERSATION_2569,"Roi may not look like much, but"
CONVERSATION_2570,"he's pretty well-known at the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2571,"If you have time for chitchat, can you help me?"
CONVERSATION_5156,"Amazing, Mr. Roi. Where did you learn those flashy moves?"
CONVERSATION_2579,"Well, let's just say I picked up a little here and there."
CONVERSATION_5157,"Kasel, did you say you had a teacher? What kind of person was he?"
CONVERSATION_2582,"His name was Brian. He used to be Captain of the Royal Guards."
CONVERSATION_2583,"Used to be? That's past tense."
CONVERSATION_2584,"Was he fired?"
CONVERSATION_2585,"…"
CONVERSATION_2586,"He passed away."
CONVERSATION_2587,"Oh, I'm sorry."
CONVERSATION_5158,"It's okay."
CONVERSATION_2590,"How did it happen?"
CONVERSATION_2591,"It's okay. My teacher Brian was…"
CONVERSATION_2592,"Assassinated by someone…"
CONVERSATION_2593,"Assassinated?!"
CONVERSATION_2594,"I still can't forget the day."
CONVERSATION_2595,"The guy with a white mask…"
CONVERSATION_2596,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_2597,"One day I'll find him and… !"
CONVERSATION_2598,"Kasel, calm down."
CONVERSATION_5159,"Sorry. I had a little outburst…"
CONVERSATION_5160,"Brian was like a father to me."
CONVERSATION_5161,"He taught me that hatred will only destroy me, but…"
CONVERSATION_5162,"I feel like I'll lose it every time I think of that day...I've still got a long way to go."
CONVERSATION_5163,"No, you're doing well, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5164,"Haha. I got a bit worked up there, but it's all in the past. Come on. Let's go, shall we?"
CONVERSATION_5165,"Let's go, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5166,"Yes. Hurry, you two!"
CONVERSATION_5167,"Roi…"
CONVERSATION_2610,"Roi, the assassins Kasel mentioned…"
CONVERSATION_2611,"Yes, they were probably the Laughing Masks."
CONVERSATION_2612,"Just as I thought…"
CONVERSATION_2613,"Hey, you so look serious. What are you talking about?"
CONVERSATION_2614,"…!"
CONVERSATION_2615,"Oh, nothing. Hee hee hee."
CONVERSATION_2616,"Huh?"
CONVERSATION_2617,"…"
CONVERSATION_2618,"Look! Muhrooms!"
CONVERSATION_2619,"Please don't overcook them this time, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_2620,"…"
CONVERSATION_2621,"Are you okay? You don't look so well."
CONVERSATION_2622,"What? No! I'll burn those muhrooms to a crisp! Hahaha!"
CONVERSATION_2623,"No, just well done..."
CONVERSATION_2624,"Are you thinking to eat those Muhrooms, too?"
CONVERSATION_2625,"Argh, those thorny muhrooms…"
CONVERSATION_2626,"The others might get sucked into the attack…"
CONVERSATION_2627,"I should draw their attention!"
CONVERSATION_2628,"Kasel! So reckless!"
CONVERSATION_2630,"If I do this, their attacks won't hurt other people!"
CONVERSATION_2633,"Kasel! What were you thinking!"
CONVERSATION_2634,"I needed to lure them…"
CONVERSATION_2635,"Still, that was very dangerous!"
CONVERSATION_5171,"Frey, what Kasel did was very appropriate for the situation."
CONVERSATION_5172,"What do you mean? Didn't you see what happened? All the Muhrooms started attacking Kasel as a result of his crazy…"
CONVERSATION_5173,"If he hadn't taken that action, we all would have been badly injured."
CONVERSATION_5174,"Don't you think you're treating Kasel like a kid?"
CONVERSATION_5175,"I can't help but worry…"
CONVERSATION_5176,"Thank you for worrying about me, Frey. But I'm strong!"
CONVERSATION_5177,"Now who was it that passed out after getting paddled by the giant spider?"
CONVERSATION_5178,"I came to, soon enough."
CONVERSATION_5179,"We still have some Muhrooms left. Let's save the chitchat for later."
CONVERSATION_2644,"Ugh, poison!"
CONVERSATION_2645,"I can block it!"
CONVERSATION_2646,"Huh? How are you going to do that?"
CONVERSATION_2647,"I've never been able to do it before, but…"
CONVERSATION_2648,"I heard that I can create a shield if I focus my divine powers."
CONVERSATION_2649,"It worked!"
CONVERSATION_2650,"Wow, I feel much better…"
CONVERSATION_2651,"Thank you, Frey!"
CONVERSATION_2652,"That was amazing."
CONVERSATION_2653,"It's time for me to do my part!"
CONVERSATION_2654,"Frey, that was awesome!"
CONVERSATION_2655,"I didn't know whether this would work, either."
CONVERSATION_2656,"I never thought to create magic shields using divine powers."
CONVERSATION_2657,"Humph! I was good, too!"
CONVERSATION_2658,"See? Look at those toasted muhrooms!"
CONVERSATION_2659,"Oh, no, you burnt them again…"
CONVERSATION_2660,"Ewww, don't show it to me!"
CONVERSATION_2661,"Kasel, you can't shove things like that into a lady's face."
CONVERSATION_2662,"Muhrooms taste better than they look…"
CONVERSATION_2663,"By the way, Kasel,"
CONVERSATION_2664,"were you there when your teacher was assassinated?"
CONVERSATION_2665,"Yes. Brian hid me in the closet before it happened."
CONVERSATION_2666,"There was nothing I could do but hide when the assassins killed him."
CONVERSATION_2667,"So sad…"
CONVERSATION_2668,"He protected me."
CONVERSATION_2669,"I wouldn't be alive today if they knew there was a witness."
CONVERSATION_2670,"But, why did they come after Brian?"
CONVERSATION_2671,"I don't know. No one had a grudge against him."
CONVERSATION_2672,"And the Captain of the Royal Guards is not one to be targeted easily…"
CONVERSATION_2673,"…"
CONVERSATION_2674,"Hush. Be quiet."
CONVERSATION_2675,"?"
CONVERSATION_2676,"I know you are there! Show yourself!"
CONVERSATION_2677,"Keen as always."
CONVERSATION_2678,"I never thought you'd be traveling with that kid, Roi."
CONVERSATION_2679,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_2680,"You, you can't be!"
CONVERSATION_2681,"What's wrong, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5180,"That mask. The assassins who killed Brian had those masks on their faces."
CONVERSATION_5181,"Bad timing, as usual…"
CONVERSATION_5182,"Roi, do you know that mask?"
CONVERSATION_5183,"Well, well, well, Roi. You haven't told your fellow travelers who you are?"
CONVERSATION_5184,"Ah, that's right! An assassin is not supposed to reveal his true identity."
CONVERSATION_5185,"Not until your mission to kill them has been completed. Hehehe…"
CONVERSATION_5186,"An assassin?! What are you talking about?!"
CONVERSATION_5187,"You still don't get it, do you, kid?"
CONVERSATION_5188,"Roi was once one of us, the Laughing Masks!"
CONVERSATION_5189,"Is this true? Roi!"
CONVERSATION_5190,"Yes, it's true."
CONVERSATION_2696,"You used to be called the 'Dark Reaper'..."
CONVERSATION_2697,"And now, you're playing house with these punk kids."
CONVERSATION_2698,"So, are you here to execute me for leaving?"
CONVERSATION_2699,"I'd be happy to do it right now, but…"
CONVERSATION_2700,"Unfortunately, today's goal is to see to that punk knight, not you."
CONVERSATION_2701,"Me?"
CONVERSATION_2702,"An assassination order for Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_2703,"Ha! There's no need to talk about it in more detail with someone who will be dead soon enough."
CONVERSATION_2704,"Here he comes!"
CONVERSATION_2707,"It looks like your skills haven't rusted yet, Roi."
CONVERSATION_2708,"You'll need another century before you can beat Roi! Humph!"
CONVERSATION_2709,"Why are you after Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_2710,"Isn't he just a punk knight, as you said?"
CONVERSATION_5191,"Darn it, Roi. Have you already forgotten the days when you were one of us?"
CONVERSATION_5192,"Of course, there is no way you would talk."
CONVERSATION_5193,"Then, I will have to force you to!"
CONVERSATION_5194,"Heh, you wish. Excuse me, but it's time for me to go."
CONVERSATION_5195,"See you again, kiddos!"
CONVERSATION_5196,"Stop!"
CONVERSATION_5197,"Don't chase him, Kasel. It might be a trap."
CONVERSATION_5198,"Buzz off, Laughing Mask! You murderers!!"
CONVERSATION_5199,"Then I will stop you, Kasel. You can't go!"
CONVERSATION_5200,"I can't let you put yourself in danger, either. You will have to take me down, too, if you want to go!"
CONVERSATION_5201,"I'm sorry for what I said, Roi. That came out before I…"
CONVERSATION_5202,"You're no fun, Kasel! Just throw those facts at his face like you were doing so moments ago!"
CONVERSATION_5203,"Haha... Could you please forget that part?"
CONVERSATION_5204,"Nope. I was rather relieved."
CONVERSATION_5205,"I had nothing to do with the death of your teacher, Brian."
CONVERSATION_5206,"But I felt guilty for being related to the group that killed him."
CONVERSATION_5207,"What kind of a group is the Laughing Masks?"
CONVERSATION_5208,"They take assassination requests and make them happen. What else do you think they do?"
CONVERSATION_5209,"They don't have a secret hiding place?"
CONVERSATION_5210,"Honestly, I don't know."
CONVERSATION_5211,"There was a place where I used to get my training when I was younger,"
CONVERSATION_5212,"but I never went out, so I still don't know where it's located."
CONVERSATION_5213,"I see."
CONVERSATION_5214,"Sorry I can't help you."
CONVERSATION_5215,"That bastard said he was after me. Do you think he will come back?"
CONVERSATION_5216,"You should be careful. You'll never know when."
CONVERSATION_5217,"Right! But, how did you come to be Cleo's escort?"
CONVERSATION_5218,"Something happened, so I left the Laughing Masks."
CONVERSATION_5219,"Assassin groups usually don't let members go so easily because they know all of the group's dirty secrets."
CONVERSATION_5220,"I was branded a betrayer and hid in the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_5221,"Dominics was the one who helped me. He was Cleo's master."
CONVERSATION_2764,"Dominics the Great Sage!"
CONVERSATION_2765,"Huh? Do you know him?"
CONVERSATION_2766,"Of course! The Great Sage used to work as a Royal Wizard. Now he dwells in the Tower of the Sage."
CONVERSATION_2767,"Humph! That old man is nothing great compared to me!"
CONVERSATION_2768,"Not that I've ever beaten him, but…"
CONVERSATION_2769,"Whatever. Dominics was my savior, and I gave my oath to serve him…"
CONVERSATION_2770,"Though I have no idea how that oath became an order to look after this tomboy."
CONVERSATION_2771,"Who's a tomboy?"
CONVERSATION_2772,"Haha!"
CONVERSATION_5222,"I'm not a tomboy!"
CONVERSATION_2787,"Okay, stubborn lady."
CONVERSATION_2788,"Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2789,"Hahaha…."
CONVERSATION_5223,"The Laughing Masks were after me."
CONVERSATION_5224,"Then…. that day too…"
CONVERSATION_5225,"So, they were after me, the day Brian was killed."
CONVERSATION_5226,"I'm not sure why… They probably killed Brian instead of me.."
CONVERSATION_158,"Huh? Isn’t that a goblin?"
CONVERSATION_5227,"Odd. I never saw any goblins on my way to Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5228,"I agree. This is not where goblins live."
CONVERSATION_5229,"They normally do not step outside of their territory. I wonder why they're here."
CONVERSATION_5230,"The goblins may have seen the expedition! Ask them, Frey!"
CONVERSATION_5231,"Goblins usually run away from anything that is bigger than them."
CONVERSATION_5232,"They will run away if a human tries to talk to them."
CONVERSATION_5233,"Haha! Don't worry!"
CONVERSATION_5234,"The Lua Order has been voluntarily devoting our efforts to finding homes for lost goblins"
CONVERSATION_5235,"and distributing food to the goblins during the drought."
CONVERSATION_5236,"They will not fear a priestess from the Lua Order."
CONVERSATION_5237,"Hmm. The Lua Order must have a lot of free time to show such mercy to goblins."
CONVERSATION_5238,"Miss Cleo, goblins are precious children of the Goddess Lua, too."
CONVERSATION_5239,"You shouldn't speak so thoughtlessly."
CONVERSATION_5240,"I-I'm sorry! Go ahead and talk to the goblins!"
CONVERSATION_5241,"Hello? My goblin friends! Have you seen any humans passing by?"
CONVERSATION_5242,"Humans!? Ach!! Humans! Humans ignore us!"
CONVERSATION_5243,"Oh, the mood seems pretty sour here."
CONVERSATION_5244,"We no need Lua! No need anything! Ach! We strong!! Show you!!"
CONVERSATION_5245,"Kyaaa!"
CONVERSATION_5246,"Don't you dare touch my soft pillow!"
CONVERSATION_5247,"Soft…"
CONVERSATION_5248,"Is that where you rest your head?"
CONVERSATION_5249,"What are you waiting for, you two? Aren't you going to fight back!?"
CONVERSATION_5250,"Such silly thoughts! I need to snap out of it."
CONVERSATION_5251,"I-I'm coming! Hi-yah!"
CONVERSATION_5252,"Oh! A stronger hi-yah than the usual!! Get rid of them all, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5253,"Or was that a hi-yah to hide his embarrassment…"
CONVERSATION_5254,"Okay. So much for Frey thinking goblins are the precious children of Lua."
CONVERSATION_5255,"That was pretty wild, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5256,"Those who attack travelers for no reason deserve to be punished!"
CONVERSATION_5257,"But goblins are not the type to attack humans so recklessly."
CONVERSATION_5258,"The situation is difficult to understand, for sure."
CONVERSATION_5259,"If goblins are this aggressive, they could've attacked the troops, too."
CONVERSATION_5260,"That's a possibility."
CONVERSATION_5261,"But I doubt an expedition made up of Orvelian Royal Knights would have been defeated by goblins."
CONVERSATION_5262,"Of course."
CONVERSATION_5263,"There is another issue."
CONVERSATION_5264,"I hate to say this, but..."
CONVERSATION_5265,"at this rate, all traces of the camp that Cleo and I saw will soon be gone."
CONVERSATION_5266,"No way…"
CONVERSATION_5267,"And what remaining traces may belong to the goblins, not the Expedition."
CONVERSATION_5268,"Then, the only way to be sure is to ask the goblins, right?"
CONVERSATION_5269,"What, Frey? Are you still thinking about talking to the goblins after all we've been through?"
CONVERSATION_5270,"We shouldn't blame the entire goblin community. It was just a few goblins that attacked us."
CONVERSATION_5271,"Let me try to talk to them first…."
CONVERSATION_5272,"If it doesn't work, we'll tie up their arms and legs,"
CONVERSATION_5273,"and drag the truth out of them in time one way or another!"
CONVERSATION_5274,"Don't say that with a smile on your face. It's freaky.."
CONVERSATION_5275,"Well, it seems to be the best way for now."
CONVERSATION_5276,"Shall we go? I hope the next goblin we meet is a nice one."
CONVERSATION_5277,"That'll be good for the goblin, too."
CONVERSATION_5278,"They look like they are ready to fight. The goblins seem to want to make things difficult for us."
CONVERSATION_5279,"It's too bad we didn't get to meet a nice one."
CONVERSATION_5280,"I guess we can't ask questions during the battle, right?"
CONVERSATION_5281,"No, we will have to subdue all the small ones, and then interrogate the boss!"
CONVERSATION_5282,"Great. Shall we begin?"
CONVERSATION_2817,"They are well equipped. Unexpected."
CONVERSATION_2818,"Goblins are goblins!"
CONVERSATION_2819,"I see some kind of light over there!"
CONVERSATION_2820,"Are those… flames?"
CONVERSATION_2821,"Whaa! Do goblins know fire magic?"
CONVERSATION_2822,"How rude! You just compared my fire magic to that crap!"
CONVERSATION_2823,"It looks like a machine that spits fire."
CONVERSATION_2824,"I met a goblin once,"
CONVERSATION_2825,"who also liked to play with machines."
CONVERSATION_2826,"That's awesome!"
CONVERSATION_2827,"Shut up. It's dirty and smells of grease."
CONVERSATION_2828,"What's so great about machines like that one?"
CONVERSATION_2829,"I think it's called 'preferences'."
CONVERSATION_2830,"I can see that they're not going to let us just through."
CONVERSATION_2831,"Can I use one of those, too?"
CONVERSATION_2832,"I don't want one, but I am curious about its structure."
CONVERSATION_2833,"My fire is much more amazing than that crap!"
CONVERSATION_2834,"I will blast them all to dust!"
CONVERSATION_5283,"Wait, Miss Cleo! We must catch them alive!"
CONVERSATION_2835,"Damn! It's hot!"
CONVERSATION_2836,"That fire is annoying…"
CONVERSATION_2837,"Kasel! Knock that one down!"
CONVERSATION_2838,"My dagger is no good, but I think your broad sword should do the trick."
CONVERSATION_2839,"Ok, I got it!"
CONVERSATION_2840,"Whew! Now we can catch our breath."
CONVERSATION_2841,"No, not yet!"
CONVERSATION_2842,"The goblins will start shooting fire again when they get up."
CONVERSATION_2843,"Then you can knock him down every time?"
CONVERSATION_2844,"I can't do this every so often…"
CONVERSATION_5284,"Grab it, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5285,"I got you!"
CONVERSATION_5286,"Kyak!"
CONVERSATION_5287,"Have you encountered a human expedition group recently?"
CONVERSATION_5288,"Expedition group? What that?"
CONVERSATION_5289,"I think 'expedition group' is probably too difficult for the goblins to understand."
CONVERSATION_5290,"Um, I mean a group of people armed with weapons."
CONVERSATION_5291,"Ach! No meet, but east head."
CONVERSATION_5292,"Are you sure? Surely you didn't attack them..."
CONVERSATION_5293,"Ach! No. Ready not…"
CONVERSATION_5294,"Huh? You mean your battle formation wasn't ready?"
CONVERSATION_5295,"Kyak!"
CONVERSATION_5296,"I guess you're right."
CONVERSATION_5297,"Why did you attack us?"
CONVERSATION_5298,"Humans. Ignore. Reject us."
CONVERSATION_5299,"We stronger now. Ach, no run more from humans!"
CONVERSATION_5300,"Kingdom! Ack, take over! "
CONVERSATION_5301,"Gas full, take now!!"
CONVERSATION_5302,"Urgh!"
CONVERSATION_5303,"Kekekekek!!"
CONVERSATION_5304,"That little monster!"
CONVERSATION_5305,"Kasel, are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_5306,"I'm okay. So I guess the goblins haven't attacked the expedition, yet!"
CONVERSATION_5307,"Well, we don't know whether the group is safe or not since the goblins spotted them."
CONVERSATION_5308,"Clause…"
CONVERSATION_5309,"Don't worry about Clause, Frey. Goblins like these are no match for him, if he had to fight them along the way."
CONVERSATION_5310,"You probably don't know this, but he is known as the 'Knight of Iron Defense' among the Royal Knights."
CONVERSATION_5311,"Ho! He's that good?"
CONVERSATION_5312,"Yes, I'm concerned about the others of the group though."
CONVERSATION_5313,"We should hurry."
CONVERSATION_2861,"Mr. Roi. Did you say you had a goblin friend?"
CONVERSATION_2862,"Kind of, yes."
CONVERSATION_2863,"Heh heh! A goblin friend. That's unusual."
CONVERSATION_2864,"They probably became friends because Roi looks like a goblin!."
CONVERSATION_2865,"So, you became friendly with slimes because you look like one, too?"
CONVERSATION_2866,"Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2867,"Hahaha."
CONVERSATION_2868,"He was peculiar indeed, even among goblins."
CONVERSATION_2869,"As a goblin with albino-white skin, he was shunned by the other goblins."
CONVERSATION_2870,"I rescued him once, when he was being chased by the others. That was the start of our friendship."
CONVERSATION_2871,"Wow! It's surprising to see that Roi cares about others."
CONVERSATION_2872,"You… how many times have I saved you?"
CONVERSATION_2873,"I saved you, Roi!"
CONVERSATION_2874,"Hah!"
CONVERSATION_2875,"Haha. Do you still see that goblin friend of yours?"
CONVERSATION_2876,"No, it's been a while since I've seen him."
CONVERSATION_2877,"He locked himself away to make a custom hand cannon, Lakrak MK-1 or something,"
CONVERSATION_2878,"and hasn't been seen since."
CONVERSATION_2879,"You seem to remember the name clearly enough."
CONVERSATION_2880,"Huh? Do you hear explosions?"
CONVERSATION_5600,"Could it be the expedition fighting the goblins?"
CONVERSATION_5601,"Let's go find out, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_2883,"Okay! Let's go right away!"
CONVERSATION_2884,"It's that way!"
CONVERSATION_2885,"Oh my! What's that over there?"
CONVERSATION_2886,"A white goblin?"
CONVERSATION_2887,"You what! Ach! You why steal my prey!"
CONVERSATION_2888,"Prey?"
CONVERSATION_2889,"Who interfere will pay! Ach! Blow up all!"
CONVERSATION_2890,"Lakrak?"
CONVERSATION_2891,"Huh? Ach, me know?"
CONVERSATION_2892,"Ach, no matter! All you blow up!!"
CONVERSATION_2893,"I just remembered. He was always like this…"
CONVERSATION_2894,"Kyak! Stop, stop! Ach, sorry!"
CONVERSATION_2895,"You, what! Ach, you why so strong!"
CONVERSATION_2896,"Hey, Lakrak."
CONVERSATION_2897,"Eyak? Roi?"
CONVERSATION_2898,"Yes. It's been a while."
CONVERSATION_2899,"Why don't you fix that full-steam-ahead tunnel vision of yours?"
CONVERSATION_2900,"Kya, kyak! Long time I no shoot, excited was, ach!"
CONVERSATION_2901,"Ewww! A goblin…"
CONVERSATION_2902,"Is this the goblin that Mr. Roi knows?"
CONVERSATION_2903,"Yes. His name is Lakrak."
CONVERSATION_2904,"Kya kyak! You with bullet I shoot, but you okay, ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2905,"Ach, tough ones I like!!"
CONVERSATION_2906,"I'm not okay…"
CONVERSATION_2907,"Anyways, why were you fighting here?"
CONVERSATION_2908,"Suddenly goblins noise make, ach. Try new hand-cannon."
CONVERSATION_2909,"So, that was the reason."
CONVERSATION_2910,"And today! Ach! Shoot Goblins! Shoot humans!!"
CONVERSATION_2911,"Good result, ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2912,"Hahaha.."
CONVERSATION_2913,"Gunpowder more I need! Fix I go!"
CONVERSATION_2914,"Hey!"
CONVERSATION_2915,"Later see you!! Ach!"
CONVERSATION_2916,"He's gone."
CONVERSATION_2917,"Yeah, he was always like that."
CONVERSATION_2918,"I was flustered by his attack when we were only trying to rescue him."
CONVERSATION_2919,"Yeah, yeah! Such a rude goblin!"
CONVERSATION_2920,"I'll apologize in his stead. I'm sorry."
CONVERSATION_2921,"Since everyone is okay, that should be fine, right?"
CONVERSATION_2922,"I'm not okay, but…"
CONVERSATION_2923,"Humph! I definitely hate goblins!"
CONVERSATION_2924,"Why don't we go back and regroup for a while?"
CONVERSATION_2925,"Everyone seems pretty exhausted."
CONVERSATION_2926,"I think there will be more goblins blocking our way."
CONVERSATION_2927,"It won't be easy to just break through…"
CONVERSATION_2928,"Let's take a break first, and then think on it some more!"
CONVERSATION_2929,"That sounds good."
CONVERSATION_2944,"This is a lot messier than I thought it would be."
CONVERSATION_2945,"Doesn't that voice sound very familiar?"
CONVERSATION_2946,"Kya kyakyak! My custom hand cannon, Lakrak MK-2! Ach, how taste?!!"
CONVERSATION_2947,"Kyak! You, Lakrak! Ach, Why here!!"
CONVERSATION_2948,"Shoot cannons, I come! Kyakyak! Shooting I like!"
CONVERSATION_2949,"That's definitely the Lakrak we met yesterday."
CONVERSATION_2950,"So, the guards were lax because of this guy."
CONVERSATION_2951,"Can't we just slip away while they're fighting?"
CONVERSATION_2952,"He's doing a great job fighting them all by himself!"
CONVERSATION_2953,"But we can't pretend we didn't see him. We have to help him."
CONVERSATION_2954,"Kasel. I think that goblin over there might be the boss!"
CONVERSATION_2955,"He is wearing different armor, and he's a lot bigger!"
CONVERSATION_2956,"He must control this area."
CONVERSATION_2957,"I don't think Lakrak can handle him alone."
CONVERSATION_2958,"Eeeek. Do we really have to go?"
CONVERSATION_2959,"Then why don't you just wait for those goblins who are running this way to capture you."
CONVERSATION_2960,"Fine, I'm coming!!"
CONVERSATION_2961,"Kyak! Again you, steal prey! Ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2962,"We were just passing by."
CONVERSATION_2963,"Go pass by, ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2964,"That one mine!"
CONVERSATION_2965,"Kekek, who you catch?!"
CONVERSATION_2966,"Kyak! Marrik!!"
CONVERSATION_2967,"This time only, him you catch!! Kyak!!"
CONVERSATION_2968,"Not because you're afraid of him?"
CONVERSATION_2969,"Kyak! Lakrak no afraid!!"
CONVERSATION_2970,"My cannon power, show you!!"
CONVERSATION_2971,"Kyak! Your cannon, block with shield!!"
CONVERSATION_2972,"What you do, ach!! Front go stand!!"
CONVERSATION_2973,"…"
CONVERSATION_2974,"I told you we should just leave..."
CONVERSATION_2975,"I know. We should've listened to you."
CONVERSATION_2976,"Come, kyak!!"
CONVERSATION_2977,"Kyak! Master Bodakka…"
CONVERSATION_2978,"Kyak! I get!!"
CONVERSATION_2979,"No, it was we who got him!"
CONVERSATION_2980,"No! No! Me! Cannon exploded and...!"
CONVERSATION_2981,"That's not true! It was MY FLAME that exploded last and…!"
CONVERSATION_2982,"Great conversation…"
CONVERSATION_2983,"Well, we can move forward now so that's good for us."
CONVERSATION_2984,"By the way, he mentioned a Boddakka..."
CONVERSATION_2985,"Kyak! Marrik!"
CONVERSATION_2986,"Bodakka who is?"
CONVERSATION_2987,"Kyak! You I know no know him!"
CONVERSATION_2988,"A great goblin Bodakka, ach! Dark Lord power!"
CONVERSATION_2989,"True boss. Him lead us!!"
CONVERSATION_2990,"Kyek!! No hear that name before!"
CONVERSATION_2991,"Liar!"
CONVERSATION_2992,"Yakyak! Cannon put away! Truth tell ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2993,"Every goblin chieftain Bodakka smash!"
CONVERSATION_2994,"Unite one strong tribe! Ach!!"
CONVERSATION_2995,"Tell us more about how he gained the power of the Dark Lord!"
CONVERSATION_2996,"Dark Lord power without, no can strong as he!!"
CONVERSATION_2997,"So, Bodakka the Dark Lord!! Ach!"
CONVERSATION_2998,"That's not even worth listening to."
CONVERSATION_2999,"Kyakyak! Bodakka you all---!!"
CONVERSATION_3000,"Shut up ach!"
CONVERSATION_3001,"Today shoot enough. So go now! Yak!"
CONVERSATION_3002,"Later see you!! Ach!"
CONVERSATION_3003,"Lakrak!"
CONVERSATION_3004,"Another disruptive departure."
CONVERSATION_3005,"The Dark Lord is a goblin~!? It can't be true!! Hahahaha!!"
CONVERSATION_3006,"Well… What I assume is…"
CONVERSATION_3007,"part of what he said could be true "
CONVERSATION_3008,"that Bodakka is leading the goblins."
CONVERSATION_3009,"If we put him down, the goblins here might scatter."
CONVERSATION_5314,"Then, all we have to do is to find the expedition group and capture the goblin, Bodakka!"
CONVERSATION_3017,"You say it like it's nothing."
CONVERSATION_3018,"Well, what do you expect of someone on the same level as a goblin."
CONVERSATION_3019,"I'm not!"
CONVERSATION_TU_140,"Kasel, look!"
CONVERSATION_TU_141,"Huh. A temple?"
CONVERSATION_TU_142,"Who would've guessed there is a temple here!"
CONVERSATION_TU_143,"A temple that even a priestess has never heard of? Hmm."
CONVERSATION_5315,"Let's get our bearings first. That way is southeast! We may find some clues about the expedition."
CONVERSATION_TU_145,"Where are we?"
CONVERSATION_TU_146,"I have no idea. I didn't know this temple existed."
CONVERSATION_5316,"As thou guessed, this is not a temple."
CONVERSATION_TU_148,"Wow!"
CONVERSATION_5317,"This place is the Hall of Heroes that only the would-be heroes mayst enter."
CONVERSATION_5318,"But not everyone that passeth through this hall will becometh a hero."
CONVERSATION_5319,"Only those who win the battle against their own darkness mayst become heroes."
CONVERSATION_TU_152,"Who are you?"
CONVERSATION_5602,"My name is Hillia. It is a name that hath been forgotten to the new generation of humanity."
CONVERSATION_5320,"I have been only awaiting for those to come.."
CONVERSATION_5321,"So who I am is of no importance compared to where this place is."
CONVERSATION_5322,"And, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_157,"Uh, how do you know my name?"
CONVERSATION_5323,"Thou shouldst pass this ordeal now."
CONVERSATION_5324,"Where thou art headed is full of hardships."
CONVERSATION_5325,"A path of hardships… Iris the Great Priestess clearly advised me…"
CONVERSATION_5326,"to protect him from the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5327,"To continue on thy journey, thou must overcometh this ordeal."
CONVERSATION_5328,"I'm a little busy right now…"
CONVERSATION_5329,"No, Kasel. You must do it now."
CONVERSATION_5330,"Huh? But the expedition…"
CONVERSATION_5331,"If Kasel overcomes this ordeal, will you light our way?"
CONVERSATION_5332,"Of course. Frey, the priestess who followeth the path of light."
CONVERSATION_5333,"What am I supposed to do?"
CONVERSATION_5334,"Thou must entereth the Room of Ordeals in the Hall of Heroes."
CONVERSATION_5335,"To open the Room of Ordeals, each hero needeth fragments that fit them."
CONVERSATION_5336,"When thou put the required number of fragments, the Room of Ordeals will open"
CONVERSATION_5337,"and thou wilt face the darkness inside of thee, which is thy major enemy."
CONVERSATION_5338,"Thou hast defeated thy own darkness, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5339,"Yes. I suppressed the horrible thing, and this thing came out."
CONVERSATION_5340,"Now, thou must taketh it to the Room of Purification."
CONVERSATION_5341,"When thou purify the darkness, thou wilt finally awaken"
CONVERSATION_5342,"and gain another light."
CONVERSATION_5343,"I-I feel this strength..."
CONVERSATION_5344,"Oh, how do you feel? Do you feel much stronger?"
CONVERSATION_5345,"Yes. I feel so much stronger!"
CONVERSATION_5346,"Can I do it, too, Hillia?"
CONVERSATION_5347,"Of course, Child of Fire."
CONVERSATION_5348,"When thou openeth the Door of Ordeals with your required fragments to face thy darkness,"
CONVERSATION_5349,"thou wilt be able to overcome the darkness and purify the crystal."
CONVERSATION_5350,"Where can I get the fragments from?"
CONVERSATION_5351,"What does thou thinketh money is for?"
CONVERSATION_5352,"Excuse me?"
CONVERSATION_5353,"My apologies. A ghostly spirit just invaded my mouth, so I had to exorcise it."
CONVERSATION_5354,"Thou wilt soon be able to find the fragments."
CONVERSATION_5355,"And, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5356,"Thou wilt find what thou looketh for and what looketh for thee at the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5357,"The World Tree?"
CONVERSATION_5358,"We have to go north to get to the World Tree!"
CONVERSATION_5359,"Let's hurry!"
CONVERSATION_5360,"Thank you, Hillia."
CONVERSATION_5361,"See you soon! I'll come back when I've collected my fragments to purify my darkness, too!"
CONVERSATION_5362,"There are two ways to getting to the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5363,"The north and the west..."
CONVERSATION_5364,"What is the distance?"
CONVERSATION_5365,"Similar."
CONVERSATION_5366,"Then, we should go west. For some reason, the goblins are gathering to the north."
CONVERSATION_5367,"If we want to reach the World Tree quickly, it's be better to deal with fewer enemies, even though it makes me nervous."
CONVERSATION_5368,"Cool. Then let's head to north."
CONVERSATION_265,"Hiyaa!"
CONVERSATION_266,"Ugh, human knight!"
CONVERSATION_267,"You're pretty good for a child!"
CONVERSATION_268,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_269,"Clause!"
CONVERSATION_270,"Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_271,"What are you doing here?"
CONVERSATION_5369,"Where are all the other members of the expedition?! Why are you are fighting alone?!"
CONVERSATION_5370,"All the other humans ran away."
CONVERSATION_5371,"What?!"
CONVERSATION_5372,"Hmm, I don't recall inviting this little kid knight!"
CONVERSATION_275,"Step back, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5373,"Even Frey is here.."
CONVERSATION_276,"Who is this old woman!"
CONVERSATION_277,"Hmm."
CONVERSATION_278,"Too many uninvited guests."
CONVERSATION_279,"Don't ruin our fun. We're having a good time."
CONVERSATION_280,"I guess I need to clean up some of this mess."
CONVERSATION_281,"Damn it, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_282,"Run!"
CONVERSATION_283,"You can't fight her!"
CONVERSATION_284,"Where are you looking at, knight?"
CONVERSATION_285,"I'm the one you want!"
CONVERSATION_5374,"No way. We can't win like this…"
CONVERSATION_5375,"Frey… Step back. This is going to be a totally different battle!"
CONVERSATION_5376,"Cleo, Roi. It's been a pleasure. You may go back now."
CONVERSATION_5377,"If this battle is going to be more challenging than the others, you need a priestess more than ever!"
CONVERSATION_5378,"AND you need a sorceress EVEN MORE!"
CONVERSATION_5379,"Damn. Those demons look tough."
CONVERSATION_5380,"It is very tiring to escort a kid."
CONVERSATION_288,"Fufufu.."
CONVERSATION_289,"entertain me!!"
CONVERSATION_5381,"Argh!"
CONVERSATION_5382,"No, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_5383,"Over already? And I was just getting excited."
CONVERSATION_5384,"Stop pretending and stand up, kids."
CONVERSATION_5385,"D-Damn….All of you, run! I will block her…"
CONVERSATION_5386,"Stop saying stupid things! If I'm not here, you can't be healed."
CONVERSATION_5387,"Is this the power of Demons?"
CONVERSATION_5388,"Cleo, I won't stop you from fighting them, but you have to be careful."
CONVERSATION_5389,"I won't be able to face Dominics if you die."
CONVERSATION_5390,"Ha. It's so irritating listening to you chatter."
CONVERSATION_5391,"Our fun ended so quickly, and now you this. I can't bear this boredom any more."
CONVERSATION_5392,"Now shut up and die!"
CONVERSATION_5393,"They can't…. They can't die because of me…."
CONVERSATION_5394,"Just because I brought them here."
CONVERSATION_5395,"I… brought Frey… Cleo… and Roi…all of them here..."
CONVERSATION_5396,"Can't let them die. Have to get up... even if it kills me!"
CONVERSATION_5397,"Wh-what is this? What is this feeling?"
CONVERSATION_5398,"I can feel… a strong power…"
CONVERSATION_5399,"coming from deep down in the earth, from the roots of the World Tree!"
CONVERSATION_5400,"But, why is this power... flowing into my body?"
CONVERSATION_5401,"That sword is...!"
CONVERSATION_331,"Oh no..."
CONVERSATION_332,"This kid...!"
CONVERSATION_333,"Maria!"
CONVERSATION_334,"Move out of the way, knight!"
CONVERSATION_335,"Yikes!!"
CONVERSATION_336,"Are you all right, Maria!"
CONVERSATION_5402,"I'm fine, Morrah."
CONVERSATION_5403,"Hmph, I've discovered something unexpected and interesting."
CONVERSATION_5404,"Let's back off for today. It's going to be even more entertaining from now on…"
CONVERSATION_341,"Are you running away?"
CONVERSATION_342,"Not exactly 'running away'.. but we will let you live this time."
CONVERSATION_5405,"And, we will meet again."
CONVERSATION_5406,"We may even join forces, who knows?"
CONVERSATION_5407,"Don't make me laugh! Who'd be your ally, hag?"
CONVERSATION_5408,"Fire sorceress, I'm truly grateful."
CONVERSATION_5409,"I've remembered several old memories, thanks to you."
CONVERSATION_5410,"The memory of my old friend who was a fire sorceress just like yourself."
CONVERSATION_5411,"Even so, I thought about killing you…"
CONVERSATION_5412,"For now, I'll let you live. Live until you meet me, again."
CONVERSATION_5413,"Then, you will have to choose to either join forces with me or die by my hand."
CONVERSATION_5414,"See you later. Ahahaha.."
CONVERSATION_5415,"Wait! Hey you! You hag!"
CONVERSATION_5416,"You hag… You have to tell me more…"
CONVERSATION_5417,"Ugh…"
CONVERSATION_5418,"Are you all right, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5419,"Huh! Clause? You're still alive!"
CONVERSATION_5420,"What about Frey? Are Cleo and Roi okay, too?"
CONVERSATION_5421,"I'm here."
CONVERSATION_5422,"We owe you our lives, too, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5423,"What about the witch and the servant demon girl?"
CONVERSATION_5424,"They ran away."
CONVERSATION_5425,"What! Are you sure!? You guys are awesome!!"
CONVERSATION_5426,"You're so strong, Clause, Cleo, Roi!!"
CONVERSATION_5427,"Frey sure did her best, as our only priestess!"
CONVERSATION_5428,"I feel pathetic, being the only one to pass out."
CONVERSATION_5429,"What are you talking about, Kasel? You saved all of us."
CONVERSATION_5430,"Excuse me?"
CONVERSATION_5431,"Don't you remember? It was awesome!! The sword started to shine, even though it was just for a moment."
CONVERSATION_5432,"And you defeated two powerful demons with only a few attacks."
CONVERSATION_5433,"And the sword changed its appearance before we realized it."
CONVERSATION_5434,"Oh? This sword is.."
CONVERSATION_5435,"Wait. Surely this isn't…"
CONVERSATION_5436,"The Holy Sword Aea?"
CONVERSATION_5437,"Yes! This is the Holy Sword Aea that defeated the Dark Lord long ago!"
CONVERSATION_368,"Wow!"
CONVERSATION_369,"Wh-what?"
CONVERSATION_5438,"Oops! I was so excited I jumped out of nowhere!"
CONVERSATION_5439,"Sorry. I am the World Tree Fairy, Rhill."
CONVERSATION_5440,"You are the World Tree Fairy?"
CONVERSATION_5441,"Yes, I am."
CONVERSATION_5442,"But why has my sword changed into the holy sword.."
CONVERSATION_5443,"Because it belongs to you."
CONVERSATION_5444,"No, the holy sword belongs to King Kyle…."
CONVERSATION_5445,"Kyle was also the one chosen by the holy sword, ever since he was born."
CONVERSATION_5446,"Then…it probably was the same for Kasel..."
CONVERSATION_5447,"Yes. Kasel was also fated to be with the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5448,"But Kyle was a king. I am just a lowly squire."
CONVERSATION_5449,"The holy sword first emerged during the time of King Kyle, when the demons raided into the world."
CONVERSATION_5450,"There is no evidence that it only chooses kings."
CONVERSATION_5451,"That's right. I also do not know how the holy sword chooses its master."
CONVERSATION_5452,"As the World Tree Fairy, all I've been doing is watching over this sealed holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5453,"But the holy sword in front of you is not whole, yet."
CONVERSATION_5454,"Before King Kyle's companions sealed the holy sword inside the World Tree,"
CONVERSATION_5455,"they shared the power of Lua that was imbued in the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5456,"You have to collect this power, and return it to the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5457,"You should meet the Elves at Elidora Forest first."
CONVERSATION_5458,"So, what you are saying Kasel is, he needs the power of the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_5459,"Yes. The fact that the holy sword revealed itself after being sealed for a long time means"
CONVERSATION_5460,"it realizes the world is in need of its power."
CONVERSATION_5461,"That means…the holy sword must have had various masters before me."
CONVERSATION_5462,"It just had no reason to reveal itself."
CONVERSATION_5463,"In other words, the holy sword existed even before the time of king Kyle,"
CONVERSATION_5464,"but it may have only revealed itself to protect the world from the demons."
CONVERSATION_5465,"Certainly sounds plausible."
CONVERSATION_5466,"Fate. I don't like this subject."
CONVERSATION_5467,"Anyway, I don't see Cleo. Where has she gone?"
CONVERSATION_5468,"Ah, the kid has her own issues, too."
CONVERSATION_5469,"Then, let's go to find her."
CONVERSATION_5470,"I will have to thank her for the time we spent."
CONVERSATION_5471,"No, you don't need to do that."
CONVERSATION_5472,"Kasel and Frey have to help us from now on."
CONVERSATION_5473,"Hah. Not us. You mean just you."
CONVERSATION_5474,"I heard your story."
CONVERSATION_5475,"Considering that witch has some business with you…"
CONVERSATION_5476,"I will stick around with you."
CONVERSATION_5477,"You need to see her again?"
CONVERSATION_5478,"Hah… It's going to take forever explaining. Can we go for a short walk?"
CONVERSATION_5479,"So, Cleo is looking for her mother,"
CONVERSATION_5480,"and the witch seemed to know about her mother,"
CONVERSATION_5481,"and now, she wants to be with me to see the witch again."
CONVERSATION_5482,"Then, do you want this sword, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5483,"Oh! Oh! Are you sure? If I may, I'm sure I can collect the power of the holy sword much faster than you!"
CONVERSATION_5484,"Kasel! You can't hand off your holy sword to anyone!"
CONVERSATION_5485,"The holy sword will not give its strength to anyone but its chosen master."
CONVERSATION_TU_231,"Humph! What a petty sword."
CONVERSATION_TU_232,"Hahaha! Funny little girl!"
CONVERSATION_TU_233,"Little girl?! I'll have you know I am a great sorceress from the Tower of the Sage!"
CONVERSATION_TU_234,"The Holy Sword Aea is not like other weapons."
CONVERSATION_TU_235,"It grows stronger when the owner becomes stronger."
CONVERSATION_5486,"Excuse me? Is this rude knight coming with us?"
CONVERSATION_5487,"Hahaha. I apologize, little sorceress."
CONVERSATION_5488,"I have something I need to do, too."
CONVERSATION_5489,"I'm saying that I'm a great sorceress!"
CONVERSATION_5490,"So are you going to capture the goblin boss that is taking over King's Plains?"
CONVERSATION_5491,"Kasel. You have a smart companion."
CONVERSATION_5492,"People who are a bit dense like yourself need smart friends."
CONVERSATION_5493,"No, I'm his smartest AND strongest companion!"
CONVERSATION_5494,"Hahaha. I understand, little sorceress."
CONVERSATION_5495,"You keep adding 'little' every time you refer to me! Little!"
CONVERSATION_5496,"Do you want see what the fire of a great sorceress can do to you?!"
CONVERSATION_5497,"Miss Cleo, throwing fire over such a trivial topic isn't a good idea."
CONVERSATION_5498,"Oh, uh…that's true."
CONVERSATION_5499,"Damn goblins! I, the great sorceress, will rain fire on you."
CONVERSATION_5501,"Clause?"
CONVERSATION_5502,"Frey. You're up, too."
CONVERSATION_5503,"Are you here for Kasel? Did the Great Priestess send you?"
CONVERSATION_5504,"How did you know?"
CONVERSATION_5505,"The Great Priestess visited me the night before the expedition left."
CONVERSATION_5506,"She knew we were headed in this direction, so she asked me to protect the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5507,"Was that the reason you were fighting alone while everyone else was running away?"
CONVERSATION_5508,"She told me to keep the conversation a secret."
CONVERSATION_5509,"She said somebody very dear to me could be in danger."
CONVERSATION_5510,"I think she meant Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5511,"Yes.. She said the same words to me, too. She said I would face hardships with him"
CONVERSATION_5512,"and that I had to help him on his journey so he would not sink into the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5513,"A path of hardships."
CONVERSATION_5514,"Hah. When she asked me to protect the World Tree,"
CONVERSATION_5515,"I thought briefly for a moment whether"
CONVERSATION_5516,"I was destined to awaken the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5517,"I never expected it would be a burden for Kasel to shoulder."
CONVERSATION_5518,"If I had known, I would've just followed the order to retreat."
CONVERSATION_5519,"No, You did well, Clause."
CONVERSATION_5520,"You did what you were supposed to do with the guidance of Lua."
CONVERSATION_5521,"Haha. You've become a true priestess, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5522,"It may be wrong for me to say this to a priestess,"
CONVERSATION_5523,"but I am quite resentful that the goddess burdened Kasel with such hardship."
CONVERSATION_5524,"…"
CONVERSATION_5525,"There will be another battle tomorrow. Let's go inside, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5526,"Bodakka, was it? The boss of the Goblins?"
CONVERSATION_5527,"Once we get rid of him and the goblins are no longer a threat,"
CONVERSATION_5528,"I will return to Orvel."
CONVERSATION_5529,"Take care of Kasel while I'm gone."
CONVERSATION_5530,"Don't worry."
CONVERSATION_5531,"I am Lua's chosen one."
CONVERSATION_5532,"I share his fate of hardship, and will light his way."
CONVERSATION_5533,"The defenses seem tight here, more than elsewhere."
CONVERSATION_5534,"This looks like the Goblins' base."
CONVERSATION_5535,"So, is Bodakka here?"
CONVERSATION_5536,"It's likely."
CONVERSATION_5537,"According to my sources, he leads the other goblins on a wild boar."
CONVERSATION_5538,"Really? That sounds like fun! I want to meet him quickly!!"
CONVERSATION_5539,"Where did you get all this information?"
CONVERSATION_5540,"I can't share that information with a priestess."
CONVERSATION_5541,"We got rid of their boss. They won't be a threat to us for a while."
CONVERSATION_5542,"His minions are running away."
CONVERSATION_5543,"But they are all going in one direction."
CONVERSATION_5544,"Damn. If they did not not scatter,"
CONVERSATION_5545,"they may assemble again."
CONVERSATION_5546,"Let's try to think positively."
CONVERSATION_5547,"They may end up showing us what they are hiding."
CONVERSATION_5548,"I hope that is true."
CONVERSATION_5603,"I'm going after them."
CONVERSATION_5604,"Then I'm coming with you."
CONVERSATION_5549,"Kasel, this feeling. Have you sensed it before?"
CONVERSATION_5550,"Uh…only the dense scent of gunpowder."
CONVERSATION_5551,"Hahaha. Kasel is too dense to sense anything subtle."
CONVERSATION_5552,"What about you? Do you feel something?"
CONVERSATION_5553,"Look at my armor. Do you think I would be able to feel anything?"
CONVERSATION_5554,"I don't feel anything, either."
CONVERSATION_5555,"Oh my! This is the feeling I had at the Hall of Heroes…"
CONVERSATION_5556,"That's right I felt it when Kasel was opening the Door of Ordeals at the Hall of Heroes."
CONVERSATION_5557,"Sigh… Blade users…"
CONVERSATION_5558,"Apparently we can find the fragments we need for the awakening here."
CONVERSATION_5559,"We should say our good-byes here, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5560,"We've finished off Bodakka and found where the gunpowder storage is located."
CONVERSATION_5561,"I have to go back to the capital and hand in my report."
CONVERSATION_5562,"Oh! I had something to finish in Orvel, too."
CONVERSATION_5563,"That stupid Roi messed up all my plans as soon as I arrived in Orvel…"
CONVERSATION_5564,"Then we can go together. We should hurry."
CONVERSATION_5565,"Wait, are you going to leave without this great sorceress?"
CONVERSATION_5566,"There must be another way …"
CONVERSATION_5567,"Oh, Miss Cleo! Do you mean you can open a portal?"
CONVERSATION_5568,"Portal?"
CONVERSATION_5569,"Hah! Totally!! We can get back to where we were in no time!"
CONVERSATION_5570,"We should really say goodbye, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5571,"It was so good to see you return safely."
CONVERSATION_5572,"We came home together, but now it's your turn to leave."
CONVERSATION_5573,"I can't help the fact that I was chosen to do this. I know I have to go."
CONVERSATION_5574,"I will join you as soon as I finish things here."
CONVERSATION_5575,"Sounds like the Knighthood is more liberal than I thought."
CONVERSATION_5576,"Well, if not, I can submit a request to be dispatched."
CONVERSATION_5577,"If all else fails, I can just drop out of the knighthood."
CONVERSATION_5578,"That's another liberty to be able to drop out anytime anywhere."
CONVERSATION_5579,"Wait, didn't you say Kasel is a squire?"
CONVERSATION_5580,"Well, nothing has been posted for the squires for 10 days after the expedition left."
CONVERSATION_5581,"Oh, that's right. I need to go through the process of resigning my knighthood."
CONVERSATION_5582,"We are affiliated with the Royal Knights. We can take care of that at the palace."
CONVERSATION_5583,"Now I'm going to the barracks."
CONVERSATION_5584,"Take care of yourself till we meet again, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5585,"And, don't tell anyone about the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5586,"I know. Rumors of the holy sword's resurrection will make the rounds in a jiffy."
CONVERSATION_5587,"It can put Orvel in danger, too."
CONVERSATION_5588,"That's my brother. You are very considerate."
CONVERSATION_5589,"All right. Roi!... And the great sorceress, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5590,"Please look after Kasel and Frey while I'm away."
CONVERSATION_5591,"Hmm. Suddenly I'm a 'great sorceress' when somebody needs my help!"
CONVERSATION_5592,"Haha, did I say that? Hahah."
CONVERSATION_5593,"Fufufu."
CONVERSATION_5594,"Time to go. See you later."
CONVERSATION_5605,"That day…"
CONVERSATION_5606,"on which those terrifying beasts stormed the village…"
CONVERSATION_5607,"is the clearest memory of my younger days."
CONVERSATION_5608,"Later, I realised those beasts were demons."
CONVERSATION_5609,"Just like all the other people in town,"
CONVERSATION_5610,"my parents were also killed by the demons."
CONVERSATION_5611,"I was out of town until I came home and opened the door,"
CONVERSATION_5612,"greeted by the sight of my dying parents."
CONVERSATION_5613,"Scared and trembling, I couldn't come any closer."
CONVERSATION_5614,"When my mother had found me with her eyes,\n\nshe started to drag herself toward me."
CONVERSATION_5615,"I then burst into tears."
CONVERSATION_5616,"Holding my hand as I kept crying,"
CONVERSATION_5617,"she led me to the loft of the house."
CONVERSATION_5618,"When she made a hand motion in the air,\n\na little portal formed itself on floor."
CONVERSATION_5619,"Right then, she looked at me."
CONVERSATION_5620,"She said something to me, which I still cannot remember clearly."
CONVERSATION_5621,"The fear of the moment must have caused me to forget."
CONVERSATION_5622,"She shoved me into the portal, and that's the end of my memory."
CONVERSATION_5623,"Even the demon invasion back then…"
CONVERSATION_5624,"must have been all…because of me…"
CONVERSATION_5626,"When you go to the Northeast, you will be able to meet the elf druid who possesses part of the holy sword's power."
CONVERSATION_5627,"Eh!? Since when were you following us?"
CONVERSATION_5628,"When I saw you headed towards the Elidora Forest at the World Tree,"
CONVERSATION_5629,"I rushed here to guide you."
CONVERSATION_5630,"I can't stray too far from the World Tree. I can direct you only a little further."
CONVERSATION_5631,"First, go straight to the East."
CONVERSATION_5632,"Whoa! A ghost!"
CONVERSATION_5633,"Didn't know you were scared of ghosts!"
CONVERSATION_5634,"Umm…I'd say it's closer to being surprised…"
CONVERSATION_5635,"For the monsters like this ghost wolf, physical attacks wouldn't have any effect."
CONVERSATION_5636,"So it'd be better for us to just sit and watch."
CONVERSATION_5637,"No need to feel threatened if you are with me, the great sorceress, Cleo!!"
CONVERSATION_5638,"If you head north from here, you'll meet the druid soon."
CONVERSATION_5639,"I have to go back to the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_5640,"Thank you for guiding us, Rhill."
CONVERSATION_5641,"It was my pleasure. Many thanks, guys."
CONVERSATION_5642,"What have we done to deserve your thanks...?"
CONVERSATION_5643,"You set me free from the burdensome task of guarding the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5644,"Ehehehe…"
CONVERSATION_5645,"Feels like I'm the one stuck with drawing the short straw…"
CONVERSATION_5646,"No, you're not!"
CONVERSATION_5647,"I'm telling you again, the holy sword belongs to you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5648,"I wonder if you have considered the efforts of a fairy trying to safekeep something that isn't even theirs."
CONVERSATION_5649,"I didn't want the sword to begin with.."
CONVERSATION_5650,"Be proud yourself!"
CONVERSATION_5651,"The Holy Sword Aea is a gift to humanity from the goddess, Lua."
CONVERSATION_5652,"Yes! I want one too! My own, unique weapon!"
CONVERSATION_5653,"Oh, right."
CONVERSATION_5654,"There was an old old saying that other unique weapons beside the holy sword exist."
CONVERSATION_5655,"You might find your own unique weapon someday, Cleo!"
CONVERSATION_5656,"Really?? Then you should have said so earlier! I didn't know that!"
CONVERSATION_5657,"That's only if you are a world saving hero, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5658,"Hah, Kasel has his unique weapon! Why can't this great sorceress have one?!"
CONVERSATION_5659,"Let's search for it together if possible!"
CONVERSATION_5660,"Everyone, please take care!"
CONVERSATION_5661,"May the blessings of Goddess Lua be with you."
CONVERSATION_5662,"Look! Dryads!"
CONVERSATION_5663,"Dryads!?!"
CONVERSATION_5664,"You don't know what dryads are?"
CONVERSATION_5665,"They are the protectors of the forest!"
CONVERSATION_5666,"I've only read about them. I've never seen one before."
CONVERSATION_5667,"They are kind and known to be trustworthy."
CONVERSATION_5668,"But…what is this odd atmosphere?"
CONVERSATION_5669,"How…by the goddess…"
CONVERSATION_5670,"They saw us."
CONVERSATION_5671,"….Kill."
CONVERSATION_5672,"Dryads would never say such words!!"
CONVERSATION_5673,"What should we do?"
CONVERSATION_5674,"We are in danger, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_5675,"It's my duty to keep you safe. I can't back off from this fight."
CONVERSATION_5676,"The rest of you take care of yourselves."
CONVERSATION_5677,"Then we'll just have to help each other!"
CONVERSATION_5678,"Somebody on the ground! She's still breathing!"
CONVERSATION_5679,"Dangerous. Frey. Don't get too close."
CONVERSATION_5680,"This one doesn't seem to be affected…"
CONVERSATION_5681,"Excuse me. Are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_5682,"I'm sorry…My kind is usually not belligerent…please understand…"
CONVERSATION_5683,"I am deeply sorry…for all this…"
CONVERSATION_5684,"Shh. Don't worry, relax.."
CONVERSATION_5685,"Hold up just a bit. I will heal you."
CONVERSATION_5686,"It's too late…"
CONVERSATION_5687,"Run… Run away… The Elidora Forest is…stained with darkness.."
CONVERSATION_5688,"the souls… are…under control of…the dark...."
CONVERSATION_5689,"…Damn."
CONVERSATION_5690,"Let's go back, Kasel. This place is too dangerous. We need to be careful."
CONVERSATION_5691,"No, we have to hurry."
CONVERSATION_5692,"It won't take long till we get to where the druid is."
CONVERSATION_5693,"Calm down, Kasel. Don't expose yourself to the Darkness.."
CONVERSATION_5694,"How can I calm down?"
CONVERSATION_5695,"This must be the work of demons. I swear they've already desecrated this place."
CONVERSATION_5696,"Don't you think so, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_5697,"Well…. That is most likely, but it's too early to judge."
CONVERSATION_5698,"There is a saying that they can control the souls of simple animals like spiders and wolves,"
CONVERSATION_5699,"but I've never heard that they were capable of controlling the souls of intellectual life forms, like Dryads."
CONVERSATION_5700,"The elf Druid must be aware of the truth. Let's go."
CONVERSATION_5701,"No, Kasel. I can't let you enter the Darkened Forest."
CONVERSATION_5702,"I know what you are worried about, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5703,"But I won't be affected by the darkness."
CONVERSATION_5704,"You can't be sure, Kasel! This was why the Great Priestess sent me with you."
CONVERSATION_5705,"Well, that's my point."
CONVERSATION_5706,"How am I supposed to be affected by the Darkness when I have you next to me?"
CONVERSATION_5707,"That makes sense."
CONVERSATION_5708,"I guess so."
CONVERSATION_5709,"But…"
CONVERSATION_5710,"You said it was your duty to protect Kasel from the Darkness during his journey, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5711,"But that doesn't mean you can block his path."
CONVERSATION_5712,"Are you unsure about what you must do?"
CONVERSATION_5713,"No!"
CONVERSATION_5714,"Then it's all good. Let's go and meet the elf Druid."
CONVERSATION_5715,"Oh, I see some Treants!"
CONVERSATION_5716,"Normally, they wouldn't attack us."
CONVERSATION_5717,"They look pretty angry, though."
CONVERSATION_5718,"You must be the ones that made a mess of the Forest!!"
CONVERSATION_5719,"Fortunately they don't seem to be affected by the darkness yet..."
CONVERSATION_5720,"This must be a misunderstanding."
CONVERSATION_5721,"Can't we persuade them somehow?"
CONVERSATION_5722,"Well, we could try, but we'll be trampled before that."
CONVERSATION_5723,"If that choice endangers Cleo, I cannot agree."
CONVERSATION_5724,"It's lovely that you do care about Miss Cleo. How wonderful!"
CONVERSATION_5725,"Kasel saying he wouldn't get affected by the Darkness with Frey around was far more wonderful."
CONVERSATION_5726,"We don't have time for jokes, guys! The trees are coming for us!"
CONVERSATION_5727,"This fight never seems to end!!"
CONVERSATION_5728,"This is bad..."
CONVERSATION_5729,"I can't even blast them freely!"
CONVERSATION_5730,"That would probably cause a huge forest fire."
CONVERSATION_5731,"Then all the creatures in the forest would definitely become our foes."
CONVERSATION_5732,"Halt!"
CONVERSATION_5733,"Oh! The princess of the elves is here.. We've been waiting for you."
CONVERSATION_5734,"Princess…."
CONVERSATION_5735,"Of the elves?"
CONVERSATION_5736,"You don't need to attack these humans, Thick Root Treant."
CONVERSATION_5737,"We have found the cause to all this."
CONVERSATION_5738,"Ohoh….Gracious Elf!"
CONVERSATION_5739,"I, Thick Root Treant, salute you, Selene, Princess of the Elves of Elidora."
CONVERSATION_5740,"I am not worthy of such honor. Lorraine is."
CONVERSATION_5741,"Hey… Don't you think we deserve an apology?"
CONVERSATION_5742,"Ohoho, I am very sorry, dear visitors."
CONVERSATION_5743,"Although I can't appleogize, since I'm not an apple tree."
CONVERSATION_5744,"Ha ha ha ha ha…"
CONVERSATION_5745,"I will apologize instead for that bad joke."
CONVERSATION_5746,"Humans are so frugal with their laughter."
CONVERSATION_5747,"That wasn't even on the level of a bad joke. More like terribad."
CONVERSATION_5748,"Considering the life span of a Treant, let's try and get over the generation gap, shall we?"
CONVERSATION_5749,"Elf princess, I have a question, please."
CONVERSATION_5750,"Have you found what has tainted the Forest with Darkness?"
CONVERSATION_5751,"Did the news already reach the human society?"
CONVERSATION_5752,"No, probably not."
CONVERSATION_5753,"Then you must have witnessed something tragic here."
CONVERSATION_5754,"I thought for a moment you were reinforcements from the Humans…"
CONVERSATION_5755,"I forgot Orvelia had its own issues for the past 100 years."
CONVERSATION_5756,"Yes. Every part of King's Plains used to be part of Orvelia back in the day."
CONVERSATION_5757,"Still, while King Veroglans II rules only the capital city of Orvel,"
CONVERSATION_5758,"our nation is quite lively and happy in peace."
CONVERSATION_5759,"However, taking the current situation into consideration, it seems we can't relax in peace forever."
CONVERSATION_5760,"Though we are not sent here as reinforcements from Orvelia,"
CONVERSATION_5761,"we'd like to help you with anything we can."
CONVERSATION_5762,"We don't have that much free time, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5763,"I disagree. Saving the forest from the darkness is necessary for Kasel and me."
CONVERSATION_5764,"I wouldn't be able to take it if someone was corrupted under out watch…"
CONVERSATION_5765,"So she says, Roi."
CONVERSATION_5766,"Alright, you win."
CONVERSATION_5767,"Now, Princess, what can we do for you?"
CONVERSATION_5768,"First, let's the one who discovered the cause of all this."
CONVERSATION_5769,"Lorraine. Here are the guests who said they'd help us."
CONVERSATION_5770,"Everyone, I introduce you to the Druid, Lorraine."
CONVERSATION_5771,"A druid? For real?"
CONVERSATION_5772,"It is an honor to meet you."
CONVERSATION_5773,"I am Kasel from Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_5774,"We aren't official reinforcements, though."
CONVERSATION_5775,"Well, our objective was met quicker than expected."
CONVERSATION_5776,"Oh, Goddess Lua. Thank you for your guidance on our way."
CONVERSATION_5777,"Welcome, travelers."
CONVERSATION_5778,"I assume your original goal wasn't helping us with our problem."
CONVERSATION_5779,"Is that true? These humans are here because of something else?"
CONVERSATION_5780,"No need to be on alert, Princess. They are not here to cause evil."
CONVERSATION_5781,"Wow, druids are smart!"
CONVERSATION_5782,"She guessed everything before we could even say anything!"
CONVERSATION_5783,"Haha, it is not because I am a druid."
CONVERSATION_5784,"Kasel's sword is resonating with the power I hold, that is all."
CONVERSATION_5785,"A sword?...I see!"
CONVERSATION_5786,"Yes, Your Highness. Kasel seems to be the successor of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5787,"Oh no. I beg your pardon for my ignorance, Knight of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5788,"Please, I'm not worthy of your apology. You don't have to do this."
CONVERSATION_5789,"Oh no... It is a given that I must honor the glorious fighter chosen by Lua."
CONVERSATION_5790,"Ahaha..this is awkward.."
CONVERSATION_5791,"If you know what we're here for, it makes things easier."
CONVERSATION_5792,"The power of the holy sword. Could you return it to Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_5793,"It's difficult for the time being."
CONVERSATION_5794,"I undertook the ritual of absorbing the Sword's power at the Lake of Eternity."
CONVERSATION_5795,"It is the source of magical power for the Great Elidora Forest, one may say."
CONVERSATION_5796,"But now, it has been polluted with the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5797,"That's why the dryads were…"
CONVERSATION_5798,"Yes, you are correct. Dryads, due to their sensitivity to magic, fell victim earlier than the others…"
CONVERSATION_5799,"Are the other elves safe?"
CONVERSATION_5800,"Yes. We are well."
CONVERSATION_5801,"Lorraine has kept us safe with a magical field."
CONVERSATION_5802,"Still, we have to be on our guard."
CONVERSATION_5803,"Other corrupted species could still attack us."
CONVERSATION_5804,"Then what do we have to do?"
CONVERSATION_5805,"I was just about to leave for the Lake of Eternity to destroy the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5806,"Come with me, Knight of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5807,"Is the Nucleus of Darkness destroyable?"
CONVERSATION_5808,"As long as we hurry, yes."
CONVERSATION_5809,"As long as we hurry?"
CONVERSATION_5810,"Yes. The Nucleus of Darkness is the demons' weapon."
CONVERSATION_5811,"It's not clear how the demons left it at the Lake of Eternity,"
CONVERSATION_5812,"but there have been no reported demon sightings at the lake."
CONVERSATION_5813,"However, it will become harder for us to deal with the Nucleus onces the demons appear."
CONVERSATION_5814,"If those who brought the news were at the Lake of Eternity, why don't they destroy it themselves?"
CONVERSATION_5815,"The Lake of Eternity is harpy territory."
CONVERSATION_5816,"They aren't suited for the task of finding the hidden Nucleus within the lake."
CONVERSATION_5817,"I see. It's because the Harpies can't swim well……"
CONVERSATION_5818,"That's not the reason, stupid!"
CONVERSATION_5819,"The magic that Harpies can perform is wind magic."
CONVERSATION_5820,"They can't use it to lift objects out of a lake."
CONVERSATION_5821,"Don't say you imagined this elf princess going inside the lake to fish out the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5822,"But the princess is not a sorceress. She is an archer."
CONVERSATION_5823,"Magic is a basic art of the Elven Royal Family of Elidora."
CONVERSATION_5824,"We also summon arrows with magic in battle."
CONVERSATION_5825,"Now, Let's get going."
CONVERSATION_5826,"First, we will head east with Lorraine."
CONVERSATION_5827,"Is she coming with us?"
CONVERSATION_5828,"While you destroy the Nucleus of Darkness, I have relief responsibilities to handle."
CONVERSATION_5829,"I need a proper foothold for this."
CONVERSATION_5830,"Could you prescribe something for us so we are not affected by the Nucleus of Darkness?"
CONVERSATION_5831,"Of course. Let's get ready to leave."
CONVERSATION_5832,"The dryads are blocking our way."
CONVERSATION_5833,"In order to help them, we have to render them unconcious first."
CONVERSATION_5834,"That means we have to defeat them first."
CONVERSATION_5835,"You are right."
CONVERSATION_5836,"Knock them out, and I will take care of the rest."
CONVERSATION_5837,"This was my destination."
CONVERSATION_5838,"Good luck with your relief activities, Lorraine. Take care."
CONVERSATION_5839,"You too, your Highness."
CONVERSATION_5840,"Successor of the holy sword, take good care of our Princess."
CONVERSATION_5841,"I will. And with her, I will destroy the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5842,"It's like a dream to be with the Knight of the Holy Sword."
CONVERSATION_5843,"Frey, Frey."
CONVERSATION_5844,"Yes?"
CONVERSATION_5845,"The elf princess seems to be interested in Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5846,"Umm….I suppose it's because of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5847,"Is it ok? Love between elves and humans…."
CONVERSATION_5848,"I know. Love between species is rare…"
CONVERSATION_5849,"It usually also ends in tragedy."
CONVERSATION_5850,"There is a huge gap in life span, after all."
CONVERSATION_5851,"I mean…"
CONVERSATION_5852,"Are you fine with these two flirting with each other?"
CONVERSATION_5853,"Well... If they don't go too far, wouldn't it be okay?"
CONVERSATION_5854,"I just hope their romance doesn't become too serious."
CONVERSATION_5855,"I don't want Kasel's heart to be broken."
CONVERSATION_5856,"Even Treants have been corrupted..."
CONVERSATION_5857,"Please be careful, my Knight."
CONVERSATION_5858,"Don't worry. We are strong, Your Highness."
CONVERSATION_5859,"My Knight, please call me Selene."
CONVERSATION_5860,"It's impossible for me to address a princess so casually."
CONVERSATION_5861,"Then can we be friends, too?"
CONVERSATION_5862,"Since we are companions to the Knight."
CONVERSATION_5863,"Of course. Make yourself comfortable when you talk to me, please."
CONVERSATION_5864,"Okay, Selene. Nice to meet you."
CONVERSATION_5865,"This is where harpy territory begins."
CONVERSATION_5866,"Seems like the darkness hasn't affected this place yet."
CONVERSATION_5867,"Family and Friends of Elidora, I beseech you."
CONVERSATION_5868,"I am the Selene, Princess of the Elves. May I have the honor of stepping onto your land?"
CONVERSATION_5869,"Of course, glorious elf princess."
CONVERSATION_5870,"Although, only if you hand us the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5871,"What...?"
CONVERSATION_5872,"Sorry, we cannot give it to you."
CONVERSATION_5873,"Then, we must take it by force."
CONVERSATION_5874,"Don't resent us."
CONVERSATION_5875,"Argh…"
CONVERSATION_5876,"How dare you attack the Knight of the Holy Sword!"
CONVERSATION_5877,"You shall pay for this sin with your life."
CONVERSATION_5878,"Wait. Let me ask you one thing."
CONVERSATION_5879,"How did you come to know about the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_5880,"Our Queen ordered us to bring it to her."
CONVERSATION_5881,"Queen Balalaika….?"
CONVERSATION_5882,"Is she the one who rules the Harpies?"
CONVERSATION_5883,"Correct. But why did she…."
CONVERSATION_5884,"We beg you, princess."
CONVERSATION_5885,"Please lend us the holy sword. My race is going crazy."
CONVERSATION_5886,"So the darkness corrupted the harpies after all…!"
CONVERSATION_5887,"You should have said so from the start."
CONVERSATION_5888,"We were on our way to help with the situation, after all."
CONVERSATION_5889,"It was our queen's command."
CONVERSATION_5890,"She ordered me to take it from you by force, as we didn't have enough time."
CONVERSATION_5891,"The holy sword is the only thing that can end this crisis."
CONVERSATION_5892,"The holy sword functions only for its chosen one."
CONVERSATION_5893,"So, you need us to come along and help with your tribe."
CONVERSATION_5894,"You mean you will help us? I don't know what to say."
CONVERSATION_5895,"I'm Naila, a harpy warrior. I'll never forget the mercy you have shown us today, Princess."
CONVERSATION_5896,"Can I talk to you privately, Selene?"
CONVERSATION_5897,"Huh!?! What are you doing, Roi? Are you flirting with Selene?"
CONVERSATION_5898,"Think as you please."
CONVERSATION_5899,"Hah! This is entertaining!"
CONVERSATION_5900,"Umm.. Cleo's eyes light up so often these days."
CONVERSATION_5901,"Sounds like fun, what are you talking about?"
CONVERSATION_5902,"This is what Clause meant when he called you dense, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_5903,"Now, let's give them a little privacy."
CONVERSATION_5904,"Have a good time, guys."
CONVERSATION_5905,"Oy, Frey. Watch Cleo for a minute."
CONVERSATION_5906,"No worries!"
CONVERSATION_5907,"Now, cutting to the chase."
CONVERSATION_5908,"Assuming that Naila is not lying to us,"
CONVERSATION_5909,"the Harpy Queen Balalaika thinks the holy sword is necessary to destroy the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5910,"So you noticed, too."
CONVERSATION_5911,"It's odd. How do they know about the holy sword when we've never mentioned it to anyone else?"
CONVERSATION_5912,"In fact, the holy sword is not the only way to destroy the Nucleus."
CONVERSATION_5912_1,"Isn't that what Lorraine said?"
CONVERSATION_5912_2,"Yes."
CONVERSATION_5913,"What are the chances Lorraine was wrong?"
CONVERSATION_5914,"Assuming the holy sword is essential for the job, or…"
CONVERSATION_5915,"Are you suspecting the Great Druid of the Elves?"
CONVERSATION_5916,"If I said the same thing to Naila, she would've gotten mad at us for doubting their queen."
CONVERSATION_5917,"We can't decide anything yet. We simply don't have enough information."
CONVERSATION_5918,"I simply wanted to talk as we both noticed something was weird."
CONVERSATION_5919,"Those kids wouldn't do, they can't keep any secrets."
CONVERSATION_5920,"Watch out for Cleo, especially. She's a nosy one."
CONVERSATION_5921,"If she asks you anything about our discussion, give her a false lead."
CONVERSATION_5922,"These harpies….."
CONVERSATION_5923,"Unfortunatley, they are insane…"
CONVERSATION_5924,"I'm sorry, Naila."
CONVERSATION_5925,"Well, there is no time to grieve."
CONVERSATION_5926,"The more we defeat, the more will be saved."
CONVERSATION_5927,"Soon we will arrive at the Lake of the Eternity. Queen Balalaika is there."
CONVERSATION_5928,"Wait. The power of the holy sword is not yet perfect."
CONVERSATION_5929,"We have to go south to collect the rest of its power."
CONVERSATION_5930,"Huh…"
CONVERSATION_5931,"We should follow Selene for now. She knows what to do."
CONVERSATION_5932,"How are the harpies doing in the south?"
CONVERSATION_5933,"They'll be okay. They have my sister, Himmullis."
CONVERSATION_5934,"Sorry to say this, but…this place has also been corrupted…"
CONVERSATION_5935,"No! Himmullis!!"
CONVERSATION_5936,"Sis, how are you!?"
CONVERSATION_5937,"Welcome, Naila."
CONVERSATION_5938,"I knew you were safe, sister! You are strong, after all!"
CONVERSATION_5939,"Wait. Don't get any closer, Naila!"
CONVERSATION_5940,"Look around Himmullis!"
CONVERSATION_5941,"While they're clearly insane, they aren't attacking Himmullis!"
CONVERSATION_5942,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_5943,"Why did you stop, Naila?"
CONVERSATION_5944,"Come on, take this power into your heart."
CONVERSATION_5945,"Wh-what power? Why do you mean?"
CONVERSATION_5946,"Oh, okay. Now I get it."
CONVERSATION_5947,"You've found a power that keeps us safe from the darkness!"
CONVERSATION_5948,"That's why you haven't been attacked!"
CONVERSATION_5949,"We are not being controlled by the darkness, Naila."
CONVERSATION_5950,"We have attained the power ourselves."
CONVERSATION_5951,"What…?"
CONVERSATION_5952,"That's the disgusting power of the Demons! What are you talking about!"
CONVERSATION_5953,"Why did you dirty yourself with that monstrous evil!?"
CONVERSATION_5954,"You know nothing, sister."
CONVERSATION_5955,"How dare you call it dirty? How dare you call it evil?"
CONVERSATION_5956,"This is your last chance, Naila. Let us dive into 'His' warmth..."
CONVERSATION_5957,"Please… Don't do this, sister."
CONVERSATION_5958,"Look at your brethren! Where do you see harpy pride in their eyes?"
CONVERSATION_5959,"What's the point of gaining evil powers at the cost of your own spirit?!"
CONVERSATION_5960,"My absurd little sister. Pride is like a shackle."
CONVERSATION_5961,"I only wished to free you of everything else, alongside me…"
CONVERSATION_5962,"but now only death will free you!"
CONVERSATION_5963,"No, Sister!!!"
CONVERSATION_5964,"I've heard enough. Any more hesitation will endanger my Knight."
CONVERSATION_5965,"I agree. Step back if you can't fight your sister, Naila. We will do the rest."
CONVERSATION_5966,"No... This is a battle for myself."
CONVERSATION_5967,"Argh… ugh."
CONVERSATION_5968,"Sorry... I'm so sorry, sister."
CONVERSATION_5969,"No, I'm the one who should be sorry…."
CONVERSATION_5970,"You are strong…. My little sister.."
CONVERSATION_5971,"Himmullis, don't say any more."
CONVERSATION_5972,"Your bleeding will only get worse…"
CONVERSATION_5973,"Frey. Aren't you a priestess? Heal her, please!!!"
CONVERSATION_5974,"Sorry, Naila. I can't trust Himmullis anymore."
CONVERSATION_5975,"I can't endanger my friends out of sympathy."
CONVERSATION_5976,"Even now, I think you should back away from her."
CONVERSATION_5977,"I'm only here to help you in case you are attacked."
CONVERSATION_5978,"I'm okay, Naila."
CONVERSATION_5979,"I…or We… indulged in the darkness too much."
CONVERSATION_5980,"Now I realize that all my actions were in vain."
CONVERSATION_5981,"We..? Talk! Who else is responsible of the fall of the harpies!!"
CONVERSATION_5982,"Don't you think you are being too hard on my dying sister?!"
CONVERSATION_5983,"It's...Queen Balalaika..."
CONVERSATION_5984,"Everything started with her…"
CONVERSATION_5985,"Sister...!"
CONVERSATION_5986,"...May the blessings of Lua be with you."
CONVERSATION_5987,"Lua's blessings?! Curse your blessings and prayers!!\nYou didn't take any action for my dying sister!"
CONVERSATION_5988,"Calm yourself, Naila!!!"
CONVERSATION_5989,"You say you are a warrior. Warriors, soldiers, we always carry weapons in our hands,"
CONVERSATION_5990,"and only those worthy of those arms are those who are ready to die."
CONVERSATION_5991,"How can you talk about pride when you cannot even understand that?"
CONVERSATION_5992,"….My apologies."
CONVERSATION_5993,"My guess was right."
CONVERSATION_5994,"Naila. The Nucleus of Darkness can be destroyed without the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_5995,"Balalaika had her eye on the holy sword for another reason."
CONVERSATION_5996,"Fine. So… are you going to put down Balalaika?"
CONVERSATION_5997,"No, our target is the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5998,"But, it seems we'll have to meet your queen to destroy the Nucleus of Darkness."
CONVERSATION_5999,"Don't call that monster a queen."
CONVERSATION_6000,"I will break her two wings myself, come what may."
CONVERSATION_6001,"She will never be able to call herself a harpy again."
CONVERSATION_6002,"It's going to be dangerous by yourself. We'll accompany you to the Lake of Eternity."
CONVERSATION_6003,"The Laughing Masks!!"
CONVERSATION_6004,"Dammit, a whole group! This doesn't happen a lot."
CONVERSATION_6005,"I had a question for you, Laughing Masks!!"
CONVERSATION_6006,"Is that the holy sword…? Shoot, We were too late."
CONVERSATION_6007,"Then it's do or die."
CONVERSATION_6008,"Grrk…"
CONVERSATION_6009,"This is bad... They are too many.. We can't…"
CONVERSATION_6010,"Now we can finally complete what Brian stopped us from…"
CONVERSATION_6011,"!!!"
CONVERSATION_6012,"Kasel!!!"
CONVERSATION_6013,"Gah!!"
CONVERSATION_6014,"Ugh…."
CONVERSATION_6015,"Was my guess... correct?"
CONVERSATION_6016,"You were targeting me... not Brian."
CONVERSATION_6017,"That's right. You know nothing about the large reward on your head."
CONVERSATION_6018,"Brian's death was all because of me..."
CONVERSATION_6019,"Don't be swayed, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_6020,"Too late."
CONVERSATION_6021,"It's all because of me. Everyone died protecting me because I was chosen…"
CONVERSATION_6022,"This damn sword…!"
CONVERSATION_6023,"I will seal it back inside the World Tree!!!"
CONVERSATION_6024,"What are you saying, my Knight?!"
CONVERSATION_6025,"The reason the sword revealed itself to the world was because the world is in need of its power!"
CONVERSATION_6026,"That makes sense only when it has met its true partner!"
CONVERSATION_6027,"I felt it, clearly. My burning hatred ignited through the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_6028,"I saw how it put you all in danger…"
CONVERSATION_6029,"That was an accident. That could happen anytime."
CONVERSATION_6030,"You are so pathetic."
CONVERSATION_6031,"Didn't you hear what your companion said?"
CONVERSATION_6032,"Death is always nearby us, those who wield arms."
CONVERSATION_6033,"True. You, me, us all."
CONVERSATION_6034,"But what about all the innocent ones who have died because of me? They have done nothing."
CONVERSATION_6035,"How many more innocent lives must I see die because of me?"
CONVERSATION_6036,"Okay, Kasel, Let's go back for now. The sword may find another master."
CONVERSATION_6037,"Frey, you are a priestess. Behave as one will."
CONVERSATION_6038,"The holy sword is a gift from the Goddess Lua to the humans, not to the Harpies nor Elves."
CONVERSATION_6039,"Are you trivilalizing the meaning behind this fact?"
CONVERSATION_6040,"I have no clue how serious you elves are about fate and all that.."
CONVERSATION_6041,"But we see things differently. This is Kasel's decision to make."
CONVERSATION_6042,"My Knight. Please reconsider."
CONVERSATION_6043,"The holy sword is a blessing from the goddess. You should never let it go."
CONVERSATION_6044,"It…isn't a blessing for me."
CONVERSATION_6045,"So…you mean… you are going to abandon the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_6046,"Yes.."
CONVERSATION_6047,"Worthless."
CONVERSATION_6048,"I would have never knew the 'successor of the holy sword' would be such a letdown."
CONVERSATION_6049,"What are you implying? Watch your mouth!"
CONVERSATION_6050,"I clearly remember you chasing after Kasel, calling him 'My Knight!'"
CONVERSATION_6051,"Me? An elven princess, chasing after a mere worthless human?"
CONVERSATION_6052,"A worthless human..?! Wow, you sure touched a nerve there."
CONVERSATION_6053,"This situation sure is far more scary than what happened with those Laughing Masks earlier…"
CONVERSATION_6054,"Scary, hah! What worthless drivel."
CONVERSATION_6055,"I won't call you the Knight of the Holy Sword anymore. Kasel, was it?"
CONVERSATION_6056,"I killed my sister, due to our cause."
CONVERSATION_6057,"I had to do it so that I could save Elidora, and the lives within it."
CONVERSATION_6058,"If the holy sword was the only way to save the world,"
CONVERSATION_6059,"I wouldn't have cared even if I had died from that explosion earlier."
CONVERSATION_6060,"And what about my conscience? I've had enough nightmares to live with!"
CONVERSATION_6061,"Enough…I've had enough."
CONVERSATION_6062,"Hmph, I'm not trying to pursuade you."
CONVERSATION_6063,"I just wanted to see how selfish you really are."
CONVERSATION_6064,"Selfish? You don't know anything about Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_6065,"Shut up. That is enough from you, Priestess."
CONVERSATION_6066,"You watched my sister die, and did nothing about it."
CONVERSATION_6067,"When you talked about blessings, I fought the urge to twist your tiny neck off its shoulders,"
CONVERSATION_6068,"only because I thought your existence was needed to save this world."
CONVERSATION_6069,"No more."
CONVERSATION_6070,"I am leaving. I won't sully my hands with the blood of you selfish humans."
CONVERSATION_6071,"Ooh, scary."
CONVERSATION_6072,"I will go with you. We can solve our own problems."
CONVERSATION_6073,"Yeah! Go ahead and do whatever! Shoo, shoo!!"
CONVERSATION_6074,"Should we go back, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_6075,"…When we first met the dryads, I asked myself a question."
CONVERSATION_6076,"I asked myself if I would be able to rest in peace, if it was Frey who killed me…with those eyes, corrupted by the darkness."
CONVERSATION_6077,"What if she came back to her senses, and realized what she had done?"
CONVERSATION_6078,"I would never be able to rest in peace knowing that."
CONVERSATION_6079,"Never. "
CONVERSATION_6080,"…And the people here are already undergoing that pain…"
CONVERSATION_6081,"Why only Frey? What about me and Roi?"
CONVERSATION_6082,"They've been together for a long time, Cleo. Don't make light of that."
CONVERSATION_6083,"That's why we have to save Elidora, to save the people from the darkness…."
CONVERSATION_6084,"I will return the sword to its rightful place afterwards."
CONVERSATION_6085,"Then, we'll go back. To our everyday lives…"
CONVERSATION_6086,"Kasel…"
CONVERSATION_6087,"It would've been better if you said all this earlier when the elf and the harpy were still here."
CONVERSATION_6088,"Then we could have avoided the entire argument."
CONVERSATION_6089,"Sorry…earlier, I was just thinking about getting rid of the Sword."
CONVERSATION_6090,"I thought getting rid of the Nucleus was an obvious task, so I didn't mention it…and then that all happened."
CONVERSATION_6091,"The two were thinking of the well-being of not only Elidora, but also the whole world."
CONVERSATION_6092,"Even if we said we would help save Elidora with them, they would have still been disappointed."
CONVERSATION_6093,"I guess it couldn't be helped."
CONVERSATION_6094,"The witch we met at the World Tree won't chase me anymore if I let go of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_6095,"What would you do then, Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_6096,"That's not important. Kasel, do you know how to seal the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_6097,"Oh, I should figure how to do that first."
CONVERSATION_6098,"*Sigh*…C'mon, stupid. Don't rush things."
CONVERSATION_6099,"Anyway, for now...let's stay together. No telling when the witch will show up again."
CONVERSATION_6100,"Okay then. Let's go to the Lake of the Eternity."
CONVERSATION_6101,"We won't have any problem destroying the Nucleus of Darkness, even without this blasted sword."
CONVERSATION_6102,"Selene, Naila!"
CONVERSATION_6103,"Heh…am I seeing things…?"
CONVERSATION_6104,"There is no way the Knight would come…"
CONVERSATION_6105,"Fufufu, the holy sword found its way here."
CONVERSATION_6106,"Now, I can be 'His' favorite..!!"
CONVERSATION_6107,"Himmullis mentioned someone called 'Him' earlier. Who the heck is that?"
CONVERSATION_6108,"Perhaps it's Angmund, the Dark Lord…"
CONVERSATION_6109,"If it was Angmund, this place would have been ruined long ago."
CONVERSATION_6110,"He wouldn't be all sneaky and behind the scenes about it."
CONVERSATION_6111,"You never know. They might have just not needed to do so a century ago."
CONVERSATION_6112,"Considering the Demons have weakened, they might have changed tactics."
CONVERSATION_6113,"You rude, foolish humans!"
CONVERSATION_6114,"How dare you chitchat in front of the Queen of Harpies, Balalaika?"
CONVERSATION_6115,"You dirty…hag…Don't ever call yourself…a Harpy…"
CONVERSATION_6116,"Huh? Still alive and chirping, are you?"
CONVERSATION_6117,"Why don't I trample over that little beak of yours."
CONVERSATION_6118,"Aaaah!!!"
CONVERSATION_6119,"Your Queen has business with those people over there."
CONVERSATION_6120,"Shut up and be a nice girl for a bit. Oh, but I've squashed your mouth…hahaha."
CONVERSATION_6121,"Now, who is to hand me the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_6122,"I will give this sword away in good time, but you are not the one, Balalaika!"
CONVERSATION_6123,"Hahahaha, please, entertain me."
CONVERSATION_6124,"Why don't we test this newfound power of mine?"
CONVERSATION_6125,"Damn, this isn't easy…"
CONVERSATION_6126,"She's a pain…!"
CONVERSATION_6127,"Are you all okay?"
CONVERSATION_6128,"You…Damn you, Lorraine!"
CONVERSATION_6129,"Selene, Naila. Hang in there. I will heal you."
CONVERSATION_6130,"...Thank you."
CONVERSATION_6131,"Thank you. I see it wasn't an illusion I saw…"
CONVERSATION_6132,"I didn't expect your help."
CONVERSATION_6133,"Kasel originally planned to come here and resolve the situation, then go seal the sword."
CONVERSATION_6134,"Do you really have to seal the holy sword?"
CONVERSATION_6135,"Let's talk about the sword later."
CONVERSATION_6136,"Huhuhu….."
CONVERSATION_6137,"Hee hee.."
CONVERSATION_6138,"The holy sword belongs to 'Him'. It's not something you riffraff can deal with!!"
CONVERSATION_6139,"Nonsense… How…"
CONVERSATION_6140,"How can the one unlock the Nucleus of Darkness without being a Demon?!"
CONVERSATION_6141,"Yes, this power, I feel it!"
CONVERSATION_6142,"This is it. I will blow you all away!"
CONVERSATION_6143,"Aside from the Sword, I have no need for you trash!!"
CONVERSATION_6144,"This…..memory…"
CONVERSATION_6145,"No…I don't want to recall."
CONVERSATION_6146,"Father… Mother…."
CONVERSATION_6147,"If I only had the power.."
CONVERSATION_6148,"I could have saved everyone…."
CONVERSATION_6149,"Kyaaaak!"
CONVERSATION_6150,"That is…."
CONVERSATION_6151,"This power is…"
CONVERSATION_6152,"Yes, this must be the true power of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_6153,"The Nucleus of Darkness is shattering!!!!"
CONVERSATION_6154,"You……………Damned runts…."
CONVERSATION_6155,"You destroyed….my present from Him…!!"
CONVERSATION_6156,"I will punish you for that!"
CONVERSATION_6157,"The Nucleus of Darkness is destroyed.. Now, things will be easier."
CONVERSATION_6158,"I know all of you are exhausted,, but please hang in there!"
CONVERSATION_6159,"The day…"
CONVERSATION_6160,"I saw my mother for the last time.."
CONVERSATION_6161,"Her face is the only thing I remember…"
CONVERSATION_6162,"Kasel. Listen to me."
CONVERSATION_6163,"and her voice…"
CONVERSATION_6164,"You are….. King Kyle's……"
CONVERSATION_6165,"Where am I?"
CONVERSATION_6166,"This is inside your consciousness."
CONVERSATION_6167,"I'm nothing but a fleeting visitor…"
CONVERSATION_6168,"You want to put down the holy sword, don't you?"
CONVERSATION_6169,"Yes…I do.."
CONVERSATION_6170,"It seems like everyone's has been saved thanks to the holy sword,though…"
CONVERSATION_6171,"The Holy Sword Aea is only handed down to the descendants of Orvelian royalty."
CONVERSATION_6172,"There is no other chosen but you."
CONVERSATION_6173,"But Veroglans II is king?"
CONVERSATION_6174,"Kasel, you shouldn't reveal that you have the blood of the royal family."
CONVERSATION_6175,"I won't."
CONVERSATION_6176,"I don't want to give up my current life, after all…"
CONVERSATION_6177,"A great darkness is approaching. You are the only one who can reclaim the power of the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_6178,"I have no clue why I'm the only one."
CONVERSATION_6179,"But I see."
CONVERSATION_6180,"So, my task is to return the reclaim the power the holy sword and deliver it to the Orvelian Royal Palace…"
CONVERSATION_6181,"I hope that's the end of my journey."
CONVERSATION_6182,"Yes. Once you've collected the power of the sword,"
CONVERSATION_6183,"you can go wherever your heart desires."
CONVERSATION_6184,"Until that day comes, I hope the holy sword doesn't burden you."
CONVERSATION_6185,"Ugh…"
CONVERSATION_6186,"Kasel, are you okay?"
CONVERSATION_6187,"Yes. I'm okay."
CONVERSATION_6188,"Is anyone injured?"
CONVERSATION_6189,"No. Thanks to you."
CONVERSATION_6190,"Thanks to the holy sword."
CONVERSATION_6191,"Ha… you woman…!!"
CONVERSATION_6192,"It's okay, Cleo. She's right."
CONVERSATION_6193,"And I think I'll keep the sword... for a while."
CONVERSATION_6194,"Are you sure? You've made the right decision, my Knight."
CONVERSATION_6195,"Hah!! Look. Just look at her!"
CONVERSATION_6196,"Haha. Selene. It's only going to be for a while."
CONVERSATION_6197,"You will meet the true Knight of the holy sword someday."
CONVERSATION_6198,"But you, Kasel, are its current wielder."
CONVERSATION_6199,"You are the great Knight, fated of the sword. You have saved Elidora from danger."
CONVERSATION_6200,"I have returned my portion of power back into the sword."
CONVERSATION_6201,"Have you, really? It doesn't seem to have changed much."
CONVERSATION_6202,"You will feel it, one day."
CONVERSATION_6203,"What is our next destination?"
CONVERSATION_6204,"The Orcs live in Ogria, north of the Forest."
CONVERSATION_6205,"They used to fight with us or the humans before the demon invasion,"
CONVERSATION_6206,"but after the invasion, we became allies and do not squabble over borders."
CONVERSATION_6207,"We all live peacefully within our own territory."
CONVERSATION_6208,"However, I cannot predict how things are over there…seeing what happened here."
CONVERSATION_6209,"We'll see when we get there."
CONVERSATION_6210,"Their portion of the power should be with the Orc High Chieftan."
CONVERSATION_6211,"The last High Chieftain I met was Garuk… I'm not sure if he's still there."
CONVERSATION_6212,"It’s been a while since any communication between our races occurred,"
CONVERSATION_6213,"Take some time to rest before you leave. You must be tired."
CONVERSATION_6214,"Thank you for your deep consideration and hospitality."
CONVERSATION_6215,"When things are cleaned up here, I'd like to come with you, my Knight. May I?"
CONVERSATION_6216,"No! We don't need a princess who judges a person by his gear, not his personality."
CONVERSATION_6217,"What do you think, Frey?!"
CONVERSATION_6218,"I'm okay with her."
CONVERSATION_6219,"Personality, huh… Take a long hard look at yourself first, Cleo."
CONVERSATION_6220,"What, Roi! Do you think you're one to talk?!"
CONVERSATION_6221,"Another argument, this time between the humans…"
CONVERSATION_6222,"Umm… This is closer to…."
CONVERSATION_6223,"their way of showing affection to each other?"
CONVERSATION_6224,"No way!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_1_001,"Finally, an orc."
CS_CH3_Main_1_002,"I'm Kasel, from the human nation of Orvelia."
CS_CH3_Main_1_003,"I wish to seek an audience with the ruler of Ogria, the High Chieftain of the Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_1_004,"Cruel, evil humans, wanting to meet the High Chieftain?!"
CS_CH3_Main_1_005,"Um, this welcoming committee is a bit..."
CS_CH3_Main_1_006,"They seem quite hostile..."
CS_CH3_Main_1_007,"In the name of the High Chieftain, punish these vile humans!!"
CS_CH3_Main_1_008,"Careful, they're coming!"
CS_CH3_Main_2_001,"Since the invasion of the Demons, I'm sure the orcs and humans haven't been hostile..."
CS_CH3_Main_2_002,"They even called us cruel and evil. Did we do something wrong?"
CS_CH3_Main_2_003,"Well, Orvelians are not the only humans in the world."
CS_CH3_Main_2_004,"There are organizations like the Laughing Mask here and there, as well."
CS_CH3_Main_2_005,"If I remember correctly, there's a human empire far away from here as well."
CS_CH3_Main_2_006,"What kind of human has made the orcs so angry?"
CS_CH3_Main_2_007,"I do hope we could solve this misunderstanding soon."
CS_CH3_Main_3_001,"Wait, thats..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_002,"Not again..."
CS_CH3_Main_3_003,"That's a golem!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_004,"Sigh...here comes the trauma…"
CS_CH3_Main_3_005,"Does Cleo love golems like she loves slimes?"
CS_CH3_Main_3_006,"I assume Roi had to clean up after Cleo when she tried to make a golem…"
CS_CH3_Main_3_007,"Clean what?!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_008,"Oh, don't even get me started on that fiasco…"
CS_CH3_Main_3_009,"Remember? You gathered some pebbles saying you were going to build a pet golem."
CS_CH3_Main_3_010,"Then you cast the wrong magic, causing burning pebbles to go fly all over the place."
CS_CH3_Main_3_011,"I'm telling you again Roi, sweating the small stuff will never get you a date!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_012,"So did she fail to make a golem in the end?"
CS_CH3_Main_3_013,"You too, Kasel! You won't ever be popular if you don't mince words!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_014,"Anyway, I will make that golem mine this time no matter what!"
CS_CH3_Main_3_015,"Now bring that cutie to me, Roi."
CS_CH3_Main_3_016,"I refuse."
CS_CH3_Main_3_017,"Our priority is beating that golem and finding a reasonable orc as soon as possible."
CS_CH3_Main_3_018,"Roi, you big idiot! Hmph!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_001,"Stupid Roi, why did you turn that golem into dust!!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_002,"Golems aren't easy to cut, indeed."
CS_CH3_Main_4_003,"Cleo, have you heard of golems roaming about in Ogria before?"
CS_CH3_Main_4_004,"Eh? Actually, come to think of it, I never heard about any orcs controlling golems before."
CS_CH3_Main_4_005,"Considering orcs and humans haven't really interacted with each other for the past 100 years…"
CS_CH3_Main_4_006,"Maybe they learned how to handle golems in the meantime?"
CS_CH3_Main_4_007,"Hmph, there's no way a dumb orc can make a golem. Even an archmage like me wasn't able to make one!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_008,"Well, this archmage of ours couldn't make a single slime..."
CS_CH3_Main_4_009,"Roi!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_4_010,"Hahahaha..."
CS_CH3_Main_4_011,"Stop laughing!!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_001,"Huh? Goblins in Ogria?"
CS_CH3_Main_5_002,"Golems, and now Goblins too..."
CS_CH3_Main_5_003,"It seems our information about Ogria was faulty."
CS_CH3_Main_5_004,"Ach! Humans! Run!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_005,"Ach, run from humans, orcs kill us!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_006,"Orcs strong! Humans weak!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_007,"Kek! What do??"
CS_CH3_Main_5_008,"What do?! Fight Humans, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_009,"Whaaaat!? You idiots...I'll teach you how powerful a human archmage can be!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_5_010,"That's not the point..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_001,"Cleo, that was a bit overboard."
CS_CH3_Main_6_002,"From the looks of it, they attacked us only because the orcs threatened them..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_003,"Humph, stop covering for the goblins."
CS_CH3_Main_6_004,"Just side with me for once..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_005,"Sigh...I can't deal with this."
CS_CH3_Main_6_006,"They attacked us first, Frey, it's not like we could help it."
CS_CH3_Main_6_007,"I wasn't exactly trying to cover for the goblins..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_008,"I'm sorry for sounding that way, Cleo."
CS_CH3_Main_6_009,"Don't do it again, alright?...."
CS_CH3_Main_6_010,"Yes. I'll side with you from now on."
CS_CH3_Main_6_011,"Still, I think we should find out why the goblins had to attack us."
CS_CH3_Main_6_012,"Agreed."
CS_CH3_Main_6_013,"I'm confused why the goblins are in Ogria in the first place..."
CS_CH3_Main_6_014,"not to mention why the orcs are making them attack us. "
CS_CH3_Main_6_015,"Shall we ask the next goblins we meet?"
CS_CH3_Main_6_016,"Yeah...I guess we need to capture a few again."
CS_CH3_Main_7_001,"Hello, goblin friends!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_002,"Ach! Human!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_003,"Don't be afraid, we don't want to fight you."
CS_CH3_Main_7_004,"Ach, Lua Order...Save us!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_005,"Tricks! Orc say, don't believe Human, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_006,"Crool...ebil? Anyway bad!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_007,"Only 'He' save Goblins, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_7_008,"Hmm...come to think of it, we still don't know who this 'He' person is that Himmulus and Balalaika mentioned."
CS_CH3_Main_7_009,"I wonder it's the same person..."
CS_CH3_Main_7_010,"Well, I guess we need to beat up these dummies first."
CS_CH3_Main_7_011,"Right, Frey?"
CS_CH3_Main_7_012,"*Sigh*..I guess so."
CS_CH3_Main_8_001,"Ach! Help!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_002,"Calm down, we are not trying to hurt you."
CS_CH3_Main_8_003,"You attacked us first, and we only fought back."
CS_CH3_Main_8_004,"Ach! Orcs trick us!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_005,"Lua Order Human nice!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_006,"Thank you."
CS_CH3_Main_8_007,"If possible, could you tell me why you had to attack us?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_008,"We Goblins exiled from Kings Plains, ach."
CS_CH3_Main_8_009,"Do Orcs chores, get food."
CS_CH3_Main_8_010,"Now Orcs say kill Humans, or they kill Goblins!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_011,"Why did the orcs tell you to kill humans?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_012,"Ach! Dunno!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_013,"Why were you exiled from the Kings Plains?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_014,"Erk...Bodakka...Bodakka exile us!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_015,"Ach! He say, no need weak Goblin!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_016,"Weak goblins? With this kind of weaponry, Bodakka looks insignificant in comparison."
CS_CH3_Main_8_017,"Weapons, 'He' give us!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_018,"He' free Goblins from Orc!"
CS_CH3_Main_8_019,"Who is this 'He'?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_020,"Sorry, ach... Can't say. We secret...eh..."
CS_CH3_Main_8_021,"Residence?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_022,"Resistance?"
CS_CH3_Main_8_023,"Yes, Resistance! Anyway, secret, ach. Can't say."
CS_CH3_Main_8_024,"Well, that's it I guess. We'll try to figure out the rest some other way."
CS_CH3_Main_8_025,"Thank you for telling us what you know."
CS_CH3_Main_8_026,"Ach...Other Goblins, still attack you."
CS_CH3_Main_8_027,"Sorry advance! Go easy them, ach..."
CS_CH3_Main_9_001,"Front go!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_002,"Yay, Golem works!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_003,"Come!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_004,"Control Golem! 'He' genius!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_005,"……."
CS_CH3_Main_9_006,"Cleo. Cleo?"
CS_CH3_Main_9_007,"Well well, it seems she's shocked to see goblins controlling golems."
CS_CH3_Main_9_008,"They succeeded where she failed, after all."
CS_CH3_Main_9_009,"Roiiiiiiii!!!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_010,"Ach! Human!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_011,"Ach! Spy us! Orcs make Humans spy on us!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_012,"We aren't spies..."
CS_CH3_Main_9_013,"Not like they'll understand before we beat them up."
CS_CH3_Main_9_014,"Bring it on, you dumb goblins!"
CS_CH3_Main_9_015,"I'll make you pay for humiliating me!!"
CS_CH3_Main_10_001,"Fufufu, piece of cake!!"
CS_CH3_Main_10_002,"Cleo, you're breathing rather loudly."
CS_CH3_Main_10_003,"Hmph, I'm not tired at all!"
CS_CH3_Main_10_004,"She's clearly mad. After all, those 'dumb goblins' did beat her at controlling a golem..."
CS_CH3_Main_10_005,"That's not true,stupid Roi!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_001,"Kyak!! Stop! Human me friend!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_002,"Lakrak?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_003,"Wait, you are..?!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_004,"…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_005,"Crow witch! I've been waiting for you!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_006,"I want to ask you about your old friend you mentioned before…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_007,"Fufu, you are a stubborn lady. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_008,"If you help me, I will tell you what you wish to hear."
CS_CH3_Main_11_009,"What!? Are you telling me to help demons!?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_010,"Fufu, don't panic. I'm not asking for much."
CS_CH3_Main_11_011,"Lakrak. You seem to be on the same side with her. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_012,"Why are you allied with Demons?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_013,"Ack? This woman demon? "
CS_CH3_Main_11_014,"So…are you really going to give up now? White Goblin. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_015,"…."
CS_CH3_Main_11_016,"Demon or not, no care!! Ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_017,"She help make strong weapon!!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_018,"Ah…Lua, my Goddess.."
CS_CH3_Main_11_019,"Please save that poor goblin's soul from the clutches of darkness…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_020,"You silly priest. Lua won't save anyone."
CS_CH3_Main_11_021,"Pray on all you want, but she will never respond."
CS_CH3_Main_11_022,"That damned goddess…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_023,"What? How dare…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_024,"No, the holy sword is proof enough."
CS_CH3_Main_11_025,"It is a present from the goddess, bearing her wish to stop the demons from destroying this world, like you did long ago!!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_026,"Fufufu…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_027,"Hahahahahaha!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_028,"A present? That thing?"
CS_CH3_Main_11_029,"Believe what you want to believe. Deeply…yes, wholeheartedly."
CS_CH3_Main_11_030,"Only then will you despair, cursing Lua and the holy sword."
CS_CH3_Main_11_031,"I really want to witness your cute face twist in horror and despair, streaked with tears…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_032,"What!? What are you talking about? "
CS_CH3_Main_11_033,"Fufufu…"
CS_CH3_Main_11_034,"Let's meet again. Child of Arlette. "
CS_CH3_Main_11_035,"Wait! Witch!"
CS_CH3_Main_11_036,"Arlette… She called me a child of Arlette."
CS_CH3_Main_11_037,"Roi, that's it..! My mother's name is Arlette..!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_001,"Hah...Lakrak."
CS_CH3_Main_12_002,"After you appeared with that witch, Maria, everything is a mess."
CS_CH3_Main_12_003,"Did you really decide to team up with the Demons? "
CS_CH3_Main_12_004,"Team up Demons? Ach, no! "
CS_CH3_Main_12_005,"I no know woman Demon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_006,"I don't think she is a demon, really…"
CS_CH3_Main_12_007,"I know she's a human. But is she on the side of Demons?"
CS_CH3_Main_12_008,"That's none of our business. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_009,"What's important is that the witch is dangerous to us."
CS_CH3_Main_12_010,"And Lakrak, we need to know why you were with her. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_011,"Ach! Me journey, make powerful weapon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_012,"I meet her here!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_013,"She say, me help make powerful weapon, ach!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_014,"Weapon impossible just tech! Magic Weapon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_015,"She help, golem controller make!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_016,"I knew it! "
CS_CH3_Main_12_017,"I knew a goblin couldn't create a golem controller on its own."
CS_CH3_Main_12_018,"You look relieved, Cleo."
CS_CH3_Main_12_019,"Of course! Though I was surprised a bit at first. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_020,"The woman said my mother's name aloud and disappeared."
CS_CH3_Main_12_021,"For what reason has she…?"
CS_CH3_Main_12_022,"Ach, powerful weapon free no!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_023,"Goblin save from orc, payment!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_024,"*Sigh*… then the 'He' that goblins were bragging about was.."
CS_CH3_Main_12_025,"Never expected it to be Lakrak. "
CS_CH3_Main_12_026,"So bother, ach! Lead dumb goblin crowd, bah!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_027,"But why is Maria helping the goblins? "
CS_CH3_Main_12_028,"Kyak! Dunno! No important!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_029,"I focus strong weapon!"
CS_CH3_Main_12_030,"She said we'd meet again…You can ask her then."
CS_CH3_Main_12_031,"That's not the only question I should ask of her."
CS_CH3_Main_12_032,"She must know something about my mom too…"
CS_CH3_Main_12_033,"Also…what she mentioned about me cursing the Lua…"
CS_CH3_Main_12_034,"…"
CS_CH3_Main_13_001,"Is Lakrak coming with us? "
CS_CH3_Main_13_002,"Test Custom Hand-Cannon Lakrak MK-3, Orc subject! Yes!"
CS_CH3_Main_13_003,"Can't you test things by yourself?"
CS_CH3_Main_13_004,"Ugh…. That's…"
CS_CH3_Main_13_005,"Allied situation test!"
CS_CH3_Main_13_006,"Ach, testing efficiency when fight together!!"
CS_CH3_Main_13_007,"Yeah, yeah, whatever you say."
CS_CH3_Main_14_001,"That is a misunderstanding, Throne. Listen to me…"
CS_CH3_Main_14_002,"I have listened to you words after words. "
CS_CH3_Main_14_003,"They are but nonsense and drivel."
CS_CH3_Main_14_004,"That's not true."
CS_CH3_Main_14_005,"The orcs seem to have some issues of their own..."
CS_CH3_Main_14_006,"Oh… You must be…"
CS_CH3_Main_14_007,"the successor of the holy sword!"
CS_CH3_Main_14_008,"Wait, how did you…"
CS_CH3_Main_14_009,"Look, Throne. Here is the successor of the holy sword that I mentioned earlier."
CS_CH3_Main_14_010,"A holy sword? Psh… what's the use of it now anyway?"
CS_CH3_Main_14_011,"Throne. The emergence of holy sword means that the world is in danger."
CS_CH3_Main_14_012,"The orcs are already in a crisis. "
CS_CH3_Main_14_013,"Because of those humans! "
CS_CH3_Main_14_014,"We have no idea what you are talking about…"
CS_CH3_Main_14_015,"Move, Kaulah! I will cut you down if you don't."
CS_CH3_Main_14_016,"…"
CS_CH3_Main_14_017,"Ah… forgive me, Throne. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_001,"Kaulah!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_002,"You…you traitor…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_003,"How can you stand on their side… those treacherous…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_004,"I'm terribly sorry, Throne. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_005,"You… our brothers will not let this go."
CS_CH3_Main_15_006,"They will chase after you…. to the end of the world… Kaulah…."
CS_CH3_Main_15_007,"You will pay for…your betrayal…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_008,"…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_009,"Throne.. Throne!!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_010,"I'm sorry. I could not choose otherwise, forgive me…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_011,"May the blessing of Lua be with you."
CS_CH3_Main_15_012,"I'm sorry you had to go through all this because of me…and upon all that be branded as a traitor…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_013,"How did you know that Kasel was the successor of the holy sword?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_014,"Is his name Kasel?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_015,"I had a prophetic dream of him holding the holy sword."
CS_CH3_Main_15_016,"A prophetic dream?!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_017,"I've heard of those before."
CS_CH3_Main_15_018,"Some of the superior shaman orcs can see the future ahead through their prophetic dreams. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_019,"You've said the orcs were in danger because of the humans. What in the world is happening? "
CS_CH3_Main_15_020,"Recently, some of my brethren have been going missing..."
CS_CH3_Main_15_021,"And there was a rumor…"
CS_CH3_Main_15_022,"that humans were enslaving us."
CS_CH3_Main_15_023,"Unbelievable!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_024,"Humans, taking orcs as slaves!? That's a total nonsense! "
CS_CH3_Main_15_025,"We've never ever heard of it nor seen it!!"
CS_CH3_Main_15_026,"I know. I believe you."
CS_CH3_Main_15_027,"The other orcs, however, believe this is true."
CS_CH3_Main_15_028,"The High Chieftain Sieg is especially angry, and has a hatred of humans."
CS_CH3_Main_15_029,"Sieg? Is he the current High chieftain?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_030,"What about Garuk? "
CS_CH3_Main_15_031,"Garuk trusted the humans. "
CS_CH3_Main_15_032,"So Sieg challenged him to a duel, and killed him to become the next High Chieftain."
CS_CH3_Main_15_033,"Isn't that… treason?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_034,"Orcs sometimes choose their leader like that."
CS_CH3_Main_15_035,"That's quite barbarious."
CS_CH3_Main_15_036,"It was, in fact, a dead tradition."
CS_CH3_Main_15_037,"However, as rage against the humans rose,"
CS_CH3_Main_15_038,"Sieg had the support of many of my kind who believed we should strike back at the humans."
CS_CH3_Main_15_039,"He then used the duel as a means of showing he would revive old traditions."
CS_CH3_Main_15_040,"What is the possibility that humans are indeed enslaving orcs?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_041,"Like, perhaps that empire."
CS_CH3_Main_15_042,"The Vespian Empire?"
CS_CH3_Main_15_043,"No, it wouldn't make any sense."
CS_CH3_Main_15_044,"They have no reason to come this far for mere slaves. Their land is too far away."
CS_CH3_Main_15_045,"Hmm… I see."
CS_CH3_Main_15_046,"We should go meet the High Chieftain to sort out this misunderstanding."
CS_CH3_Main_15_047,"We should first meet my apprentice, Dain. He will be able to help us."
CS_CH3_Main_16_001,"Do you know about the divided power of the holy sword?"
CS_CH3_Main_16_002,"Yes. Our legendary High Chieftain, Aeatola,"
CS_CH3_Main_16_003,"the Orc hero that had helped Kyle at the time, put the power into a talisman. "
CS_CH3_Main_16_004,"The talisman has then passed on to each generation of High Chieftains. "
CS_CH3_Main_16_005,"Then Sieg must have it now."
CS_CH3_Main_16_006,"Correct."
CS_CH3_Main_16_007,"*Sigh*…what a pain."
CS_CH3_Main_17_001,"We will be able to meet Dain, north from here."
CS_CH3_Main_17_002,"I hope no harm befell him because of me…"
CS_CH3_Main_17_003,"Goddess Lua, please protect Dain, the apprentice of Kaulah. "
CS_CH3_Main_17_004,"We should hurry before anything bad happens."
CS_CH3_Main_18_001,"Master! Are you all right?"
CS_CH3_Main_18_002,"Oh, Dain. Thank the heavens. I was worried about you."
CS_CH3_Main_18_003,"And I am still worried about you to this day"
CS_CH3_Main_18_004,"Why are you with humans in these dangerous times?"
CS_CH3_Main_18_005,"I'm sorry…Kaulah was branded a traitor because of us."
CS_CH3_Main_18_006,"I have something private to discuss with my master, could you guests wait here for a while? "
CS_CH3_Main_18_007,"Of course. "
CS_CH3_Main_18_008,"What, what is it? "
CS_CH3_Main_18_009,"A trap?!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_010,"What is going on, Dain?!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_011,"I have to get rid of the humans, master. I'm sorry. "
CS_CH3_Main_18_012,"This is the only way to keep you alive."
CS_CH3_Main_18_013,"You blinded fool... The darkness is attempting to swallow this very world."
CS_CH3_Main_18_014,"The safety of the orcs is not the only thing at stake!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_015,"We're gonna fall!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_016,"Kasel: Frey!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_017,"Frey: Kyaaaaaa!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_018,"Kasel: No, Lua, Please…"
CS_CH3_Main_18_019,"Kasel: Protect Frey.. Please!!! If anyone has to die, please let it be me…and not Frey!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_020,"Cleo: Frey!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_021,"Roi: Guh…"
CS_CH3_Main_18_022,"Cleo: Won't…give up!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_023,"Roi: Give me your hand, Kasel!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_024,"Roi: I got you!! Up, now, Cleo!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_025,"Cleo: Okay, Let me show you what speed is!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_026,"Cleo: My staff is the staff to pierce the heavens!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_18_027,"Roi: Ugh… we saved them, you can slow down now…"
CS_CH3_Main_19_001,"What are you planning."
CS_CH3_Main_19_002,"This is the order of the High Chieftain Sieg. He said he would kill you if we didn't get rid of the humans."
CS_CH3_Main_19_003,"Absurd...Are you trying to doom the world with darkness because of me!?"
CS_CH3_Main_19_004,"That is why... we have come to save the world from the darkness!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_005,"Oh… You are alive."
CS_CH3_Main_19_006,"Grk…You shouldn't be alive!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_007,"Die!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_008,"Stop!! Dain, Stop!!"
CS_CH3_Main_19_009,"I'm sorry, Kaulah. We have to defend ourselves…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_001,"Kugh…. They are strong…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_002,"Let's stop now, Dain. These people can beat some sense into Sieg."
CS_CH3_Main_20_003,"That…sounds possible…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_004,"What did you do that for?!!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_005,"Humph, Orcs are so naive."
CS_CH3_Main_20_006,"Well, that is the cause of this entire mess, anyhow."
CS_CH3_Main_20_007,"Maria!! Why…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_008,"Not only the orcs, but you too are all so naïve."
CS_CH3_Main_20_009,"Did you really think you'd be able to persuade him? "
CS_CH3_Main_20_010,"We should at least try!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_011,"And then you will die trying."
CS_CH3_Main_20_012,"I can't have you dying, just yet."
CS_CH3_Main_20_013,"And why is that?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_014,"Hmm, don't you remember? "
CS_CH3_Main_20_015,"I said I want to see you in a certain situation."
CS_CH3_Main_20_016,"Was that about us cursing Lua?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_017,"Yeah, I wanted to ask you what you meant about that."
CS_CH3_Main_20_018,"Fufufu, you'll have to figure that out by yourself."
CS_CH3_Main_20_019,"There are so many more stories to tell you."
CS_CH3_Main_20_020,"Okay, then tell me about my mother Arlette.."
CS_CH3_Main_20_021,"Fufufu, Arlette.. I never said Arlette was your mother…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_022,"What?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_023,"Come to think of it, all four of us don't know our parents. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_024,"Do you know any other of our parents, aside from Cleo's?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_025,"Fufu, Don't rush. Take it easy."
CS_CH3_Main_20_026,"Today I came to tell you another story. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_027,"A story about who triggered the Orcish hatred for humans."
CS_CH3_Main_20_028,"I wonder if you know him… a certain Malduk."
CS_CH3_Main_20_029,"Malduk..!!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_030,"The Strategist of Angmund…? That Malduk?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_031,"Yes. He has been turning Orcs into undead since quite some time ago."
CS_CH3_Main_20_032,"He then lied to the Orcs, including Sieg, that the humans were to blame for the missing Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_20_033,"That nasty.."
CS_CH3_Main_20_034,"Why are you telling us all this?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_035,"Aren't you allied with the Demons?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_036,"I didn't like that bony bastard to begin with."
CS_CH3_Main_20_037,"Then...the reason you were trying to get the Goblins to confront the Orcs alongside Lakrak…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_038,"Yes, Malduk had taken advantage of the Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_20_039,"So, I took advantage of the Goblins, considering they hold a grudge towards the Orcs."
CS_CH3_Main_20_040,"Malduk aside, you are really evil."
CS_CH3_Main_20_041,"Both sides will sustain terrible losses once they clash,"
CS_CH3_Main_20_042,"and the hatred between both sides will only grow larger!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_043,"So? As part of the Demon Army, I consider it a win if you idiots have a falling out."
CS_CH3_Main_20_044,"What?!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_045,"Damn… Trying to break apart the alliance between the races of this world…"
CS_CH3_Main_20_046,"We have to report this to Orvelia. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_047,"Fufufu, the Orvelians won't do anything about it."
CS_CH3_Main_20_048,"The royal family and the aristocrats will hole up in their little palace and think about how to survive, even if they have to throw away everything else."
CS_CH3_Main_20_049,"In the meanwhile… they'd try to kill you so the news doesn't spread."
CS_CH3_Main_20_050,"How dare you insult the Orvelian Royalty!!"
CS_CH3_Main_20_052,"Fufu… Naïve. Naïve as usual."
CS_CH3_Main_20_053,"Anyway, you wouldn't want to tell Orvelia about this. "
CS_CH3_Main_20_054,"Not that they would even be a match for the Demon Army, anyway."
CS_CH3_Main_20_055,"As things are right now, Orvel is an easy target - overthrowing it is nothing."
CS_CH3_Main_20_056,"So, mark my words. If you do as I say, an all-out war will not occur."
CS_CH3_Main_20_057,"And why should we trust you?"
CS_CH3_Main_20_058,"You don't need to."
CS_CH3_Main_20_059,"The choice is yours."
CS_CH3_Main_20_060,"Goodbye, then. We'll meet again."
CS_CH3_Main_20_061,"You old hag..! "
CS_CH3_Main_20_062,"Don't just leave like that! "
CS_CH3_Main_21_001,"Goddess Lua, please forgive Dain…"
CS_CH3_Main_21_002,"who made a dire choice for his master."
CS_CH3_Main_21_003,"I thank you for praying for my apprentice…"
CS_CH3_Main_21_004,"I assume it'd be easier to beat down Sieg rather than pursuade him."
CS_CH3_Main_21_005,"I'm pretty sure the Orcs will try to stop us."
CS_CH3_Main_21_006,"We'd have no choice but to beat them up in order to progress, Kaulah."
CS_CH3_Main_21_007,"I will come with you. I will try to…persuade them."
CS_CH3_Main_21_008,"If it doesn't work…"
CS_CH3_Main_21_009,"I will help you. I have already stained my hands with the blood of my kind."
CS_CH3_Main_21_010,"I'm sorry, Kaulah... for involving you in this situation. "
CS_CH3_Main_21_011,"This is not your fault, Kasel. "
CS_CH3_Main_21_012,"There will be bigger losses if we do not stop this war. We must try our best."
CS_CH3_Main_21_013,"Kasel, I agree with Maria.."
CS_CH3_Main_21_014,"You should wait before reporting this crisis to Orvelia. "
CS_CH3_Main_21_015,"I believe so too."
CS_CH3_Main_21_016,"The Laughing Masks… We don't know who they work for…"
CS_CH3_Main_21_017,"and whose will it is to kill me…"
CS_CH3_Main_21_018,"Kasel…"
CS_CH3_Main_21_019,"I'll find out one day, surely."
CS_CH3_Main_21_020,"But that's not what's important now. This comes first."
CS_CH3_Main_22_001,"Kaulah!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_002,"It's the traitor, Kaulah!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_003,"Comrades, We'd been fooled by the Demons. "
CS_CH3_Main_22_004,"Malduk, the Demon's strategist was the one who'd been kidnapping us Orcs and turning them into the undead.."
CS_CH3_Main_22_005,"Who would listen to a traitor's words!!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_006,"Pay for your sins with death, Kaulah! "
CS_CH3_Main_22_007,"I knew this would happen. "
CS_CH3_Main_22_008,"We can't give up on persuading them, Roi."
CS_CH3_Main_22_009,"Yeah, Roi, We should try our best!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_010,"*Sigh*… Cleo, How about reflecting on yourself a bit?"
CS_CH3_Main_22_011,"Later! We need to beat these guys up first!"
CS_CH3_Main_22_012,"Go easy on them, please."
CS_CH3_Main_23_001,"Hmm, there's a battle going on already."
CS_CH3_Main_23_002,"Wow... Lakrak is leading all those goblins and golems…"
CS_CH3_Main_23_003,"I don't like this…! Humph! "
CS_CH3_Main_24_001,"My experiment near end! Ach! "
CS_CH3_Main_24_002,"Leave now, make stronger weapon!!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_003,"Lakrak. What about the Goblins here following you.."
CS_CH3_Main_24_004,"Who care!!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_005,"Give golem control and machine, they do they want!! Kyak!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_006,"I follow you, I find strong test subject! "
CS_CH3_Main_24_007,"Wait bit! I follow after test, kyak!!"
CS_CH3_Main_24_008,"I'm up for that, my friend. "
CS_CH3_Main_24_009,"I'm not. I don't want to be on the same team with Goblins.."
CS_CH3_Main_24_010,"Cleo, no discrimination against the other races without reason."
CS_CH3_Main_24_011,"So..sorry…. Just don't tell me to sleep alone from now on."
CS_CH3_Main_24_012,"I can't fall asleep without Frey anymore.."
CS_CH3_Main_24_013,"Is this about that pillow thing…"
CS_CH3_Main_24_014,"Frey, you've got a small problem now, hahaha."
CS_CH3_Main_25_001,"Sieg!!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_002,"Is the one next to him Malduk?"
CS_CH3_Main_25_003,"I guess so. Look, skulls!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_004,"Sieg!! We were all deceived by him!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_005,"He blamed humans for all that he had done to the Orcs! He's the one who captured Orcs, turning them into undead! "
CS_CH3_Main_25_006,"What?!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_007,"Honorable High Chieftain,"
CS_CH3_Main_25_008,"a great warrior like you wouldn't have killed your most honored predecessor, Garuk, out of a small misunderstanding."
CS_CH3_Main_25_009,"Everything you did was for your race. For the sake of your tribe. "
CS_CH3_Main_25_010,"These imbeciles are insulting your decision, your honor."
CS_CH3_Main_25_011,"They must pay with their lives."
CS_CH3_Main_25_012,"…Yes."
CS_CH3_Main_25_013,"Indeed! I am the leader of Orcs. I will not forgive the humans that enslaved my kind! "
CS_CH3_Main_25_014,"That includes you, Kaulah! Pay for your betrayal!!"
CS_CH3_Main_25_015,"What a blockhead…"
CS_CH3_Main_25_017,"He just can't admit the truth. "
CS_CH3_Main_25_018,"The truth that he killed Garuk out of a misunderstanding…"
CS_CH3_Main_25_019,"Pay for your sins with death!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_26_001,"That's a High Chieftain. What strength…"
CS_CH3_Main_26_002,"Kasel, Can't you use the power of the holy sword?"
CS_CH3_Main_26_003,"I'm sorry… I… I'm not capable of controlling it yet.."
CS_CH3_Main_26_004,"The power just comes out on its own…"
CS_CH3_Main_26_005,"Jeez, don't apologize for everything!"
CS_CH3_Main_26_006,"We'll finish this somehow!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_001,"Kugh… Malduk…. Malduk!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_002,"I'm done for…. "
CS_CH3_Main_27_003,"Save my tribe… from those treacherous human beings. "
CS_CH3_Main_27_004,"Kukukukuku…."
CS_CH3_Main_27_005,"Kakaka..kahahahahahaha!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_006,"Idiotic Orc."
CS_CH3_Main_27_007,"Wha..what are you laughing at?!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_008,"The missing Orcs will soon rise again as undead"
CS_CH3_Main_27_009,"and become loyal members of the Demon Army."
CS_CH3_Main_27_010,"What…have I done.."
CS_CH3_Main_27_011,"You killed Garuk out of a small misunderstanding, that's all."
CS_CH3_Main_27_012,"Kukukuku….."
CS_CH3_Main_27_013,"Y….You…!!!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_014,"Guh….."
CS_CH3_Main_27_015,"Sieg!!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_016,"Did…did you really have to…"
CS_CH3_Main_27_017,"Did you have to laugh at a dying person, insulting their last moments!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_018,"Kukuku…"
CS_CH3_Main_27_019,"I see…Wielder of the holy sword…"
CS_CH3_Main_27_020,"How do you feel, hmm? Don't you feel any anger inside of you? "
CS_CH3_Main_27_021,"You… I will never forgive you!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_022,"Yes, that's right."
CS_CH3_Main_27_023,"Beautiful."
CS_CH3_Main_27_024,"Hahahaha!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_025,"Rage! Fury! Hate! More, more, stain the holy sword in even more darkness!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_026,"I hope the next time we cross paths, you will show me even greater hatred."
CS_CH3_Main_27_027,"Don't run, coward!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_028,"Damn, he lost us."
CS_CH3_Main_27_029,"Aaaaaaaah!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_030,"Guh… Kasel!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_031,"Kasel, no!!"
CS_CH3_Main_27_032,"Stay strong, please…"
CS_CH3_Main_27_033,"Kugh…"
CS_CH3_Main_27_034,"Grrk…kugh…"
CS_CH3_Main_27_035,"Frey.. Th..Thank you.."
CS_CH3_Main_27_036,"Kasel! "
CS_CH3_Main_28_001,"Kasel… Kasel!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_28_002,"Ugh…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_003,"Malduk!!!"
CS_CH3_Main_28_004,"Calm down, Kasel. Malduk is gone."
CS_CH3_Main_28_005,"Is it because he left…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_006,"I think I went crazy for a bit there…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_007,"Yeah, but…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_008,"thanks to Frey, nothing went wrong."
CS_CH3_Main_28_009,"Frey called for Kasel, and then you came back to normal without any issues."
CS_CH3_Main_28_011,"Thank you, Frey. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_012,"Everything's okay, Kasel. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_013,"What about Sieg… what about the Orcs of Ogria."
CS_CH3_Main_28_014,"I will lead the tribe until the next chieftain is chosen. I'm the highest ranking shaman here so far."
CS_CH3_Main_28_015,"Don't worry about us. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_016,"Now that we've gained the talisman of Aeatola, we should transfer its power back into the holy sword."
CS_CH3_Main_28_017,"Not now…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_018,"Please, hold onto the talisman for now."
CS_CH3_Main_28_019,"Shouldn't you return its power? "
CS_CH3_Main_28_020,"I'm not capable of controlling Aea yet. It's too early…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_021,"If I fail to control the sword's power after it gets stronger…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_022,"I can't be sure who or where I'll be aiming the sword at…."
CS_CH3_Main_28_023,"Kasel…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_024,"Anyway, we should still figure out where the rest of the power is."
CS_CH3_Main_28_025,"It's still part of my mission."
CS_CH3_Main_28_026,"Of course. "
CS_CH3_Main_28_027,"I assume that the Northern Barbarians would have another portion of the power."
CS_CH3_Main_28_028,"Ugh..You mean the barbarian empire beyond the high cliff? I heard that even birds can't fly over that cliff."
CS_CH3_Main_28_029,"Correct. We have no choice but to pass through Galluah and Aegina."
CS_CH3_Main_28_030,"Which way is Galluah?"
CS_CH3_Main_28_031,"To the south."
CS_CH3_Main_28_032,"It will be a long trip."
CS_CH3_Main_28_033,"The Barbarian Empire… It will be our first time meeting humans of a different country, Kasel."
CS_CH3_Main_28_034,"Yeah, I hope we don't cause them any trouble."
CS_CH3_Main_28_035,"When I was inside the dark, I heard Frey's voice…it was weaker than before…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_036,"Someday… I might not be able to hear her voice at all"
CS_CH3_Main_28_037,"and sink into the abyss of darkness…"
CS_CH3_Main_28_038,"Before that, I have to give back the holy sword to my king."
CS_CH3_Main_28_039,"Now, though…I wonder if that’s the right thing to do."
CS_CH3_Main_29_001,"Did Malduk head to Galluah?"
CS_CH3_Main_29_002,"Yes. "
CS_CH3_Main_29_003,"I guess it would be too much to expect much from those greenhorns."
CS_CH3_Main_29_004,"If you expected them to kill Malduk…"
CS_CH3_Main_29_005,"Yes, I agree."
CS_CH3_Main_29_006,"I see."
CS_CH3_Main_29_007,"I think…I've become a little too talkative."
CS_CH3_Main_29_008,"There was plenty of time to forget everything…"
CS_CH3_Main_29_009,"I thought I had forgotten everything."
CS_CH3_Main_29_010,"But as soon as I saw her child…all my pent up anger and frustration bubbled up."
CS_CH3_Main_29_011,"Maria.."
CS_CH3_Main_29_012,"Fufufu…"
CS_CH3_Main_29_013,"Well, no matter."
CS_CH3_Main_29_014,"They are still puppets of Lua."
CS_CH3_Main_29_015,"Nothing I do will even register in comparison to what Lua has in store for them…"
CS_CH3_Main_29_016,"Did Epis head towards Galluah? "
CS_CH3_Main_29_017,"Yes. After she heard about you, she seemed to be in a hurry."
CS_CH3_Main_29_018,"Fufufu… Now all we have to do is to enjoy the puppet show in Galluah. "
CS_CH4_Main_0_001,"Ugh… This place is freaky."
CS_CH4_Main_0_002,"Of course. This land is called the Land of Death."
CS_CH4_Main_0_003,"Land of Death? "
CS_CH4_Main_0_004,"It's a land devastated by past wars."
CS_CH4_Main_0_005,"There used to be a number of human dukedoms in Galluah."
CS_CH4_Main_0_006,"They often warred with the Orc tribes,"
CS_CH4_Main_0_007,"but they were all destroyed after the sudden appearance of the Demon Army."
CS_CH4_Main_0_008,"Now, not a single sapient being exists in this land."
CS_CH4_Main_1_001,"Whoa, is that a floating sword with a mouth on it?"
CS_CH4_Main_1_002,"A living sword…!"
CS_CH4_Main_1_003,"Apparently Galluah has been completely overrun by Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_1_004,"Are those Demon weapons?"
CS_CH4_Main_1_005,"Not exactly. Those aren't really weapons, they're actually Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_1_006,"The Demon's World, which is called the World of Darkness, has no form."
CS_CH4_Main_1_007,"The entities from that world also have no form."
CS_CH4_Main_1_008,"So when the Demons crossed over the Gate into this world, Angmund gave them material form."
CS_CH4_Main_1_009,"Also, as he corrupted the land, he injected the souls of Demons into the entities of this world."
CS_CH4_Main_1_010,"These beings are all categorized as Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_1_011,"Living equipment like that living sword are also part of the latter type of Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_1_012,"It's my first time seeing these Demons, but low class Demons such as these aren't a problem for an archmage such as myself!"
CS_CH4_Main_2_001,"Hmm.. If the world of darkness has no form…"
CS_CH4_Main_2_002,"would Lua and the World of Light exist under the same rules?"
CS_CH4_Main_2_003,"Yes. Lua too is a spiritual existence,"
CS_CH4_Main_2_004,"but she materializes herself when she shows herself to us in this world."
CS_CH4_Main_2_005,"The World of Light is also called the realm of the gods,"
CS_CH4_Main_2_006,"and it is said that they can create any kind of element or material."
CS_CH4_Main_2_007,"Magicians thus categorize our world as 'The Material World',"
CS_CH4_Main_2_008,"to distinguish it from the other formless worlds."
CS_CH4_Main_2_009,"I know you guys are brawny rather than brainy, but this much is basic knowledge. Remember it!"
CS_CH4_Sub_1_001,"Golems again, huh."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_002,"They must be Galluan Golems, created by the human dukedoms for their wars against the Orcs."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_003,"Now, however…it seems the Demons control them."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_004,"We should have borrowed a golem controller from Lakrak. "
CS_CH4_Sub_1_005,"*Sigh*…blade users..."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_006,"Once a golem is under the control of a person, nobody can hijack that particular golem."
CS_CH4_Sub_1_007,"Golems that have lost their masters and deactivated are a different case, though."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_001,"Ugh. Are those the rumoured beasts afflicted by the Dark Disease?"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_002,"They look much worse than what the rumours say…"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_003,"Poor animals…The skin is all ripped apart, and the bones are poking out of its body…"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_004,"Is the Dark Disease also caused by the Demons?"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_005,"It's hard to say it is…"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_006,"but there is a connection between the two."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_007,"I think I mentioned this in Ellidora, "
CS_CH4_Sub_2_008,"but remember when I said there are cases of Demons taking over animals?"
CS_CH4_Sub_2_009,"Yes. I remember. "
CS_CH4_Sub_2_010,"The Dark Disease is a side effect of that case."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_011,"The afflicted animal struggles in pain, hurting itself in the process."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_012,"Considering the bones…I'd say this one has been afflicted for a few months."
CS_CH4_Sub_2_013,"That's around the time that the Demons began to re-emerge. "
CS_CH4_Sub_2_014,"We need to put these poor children to rest."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_001,"If the disease is triggered by the corruption of Darkness,"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_002,"Would the dryads and harpies of Ellidora be okay?"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_003,"We don't have to worry about them for now. "
CS_CH4_Sub_3_004,"The Nucleus of Darkness is structured in a different way,"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_005,"in comparison to how Demons control animals."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_006,"How do you know that? "
CS_CH4_Sub_3_007,"I took a few samples of the destroyed Nucleus for study."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_008,"Did you really think I'd overlook such a dangerous item without studying it?"
CS_CH4_Sub_3_009,"Ha, you really did well, Cleo."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_010,"Ew…It's weird to hear you compliment me."
CS_CH4_Sub_3_011,"*Sigh*…give me back my gratitude."
CS_CH4_Main_3_001,"Hm? What is it, Kasel?"
CS_CH4_Main_3_002,"Kasel… Don't be anxious. You are not a helpless child anymore."
CS_CH4_Main_3_003,"I'm fine. I was just... a little surprised."
CS_CH4_Main_3_004,"You don't seem like your usual self, Kasel."
CS_CH4_Main_3_005,"It's a vague memory… but when I was younger, my village was attacked by Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_3_006,"seeing that Demon just…reminded me of that day. It's ok. I'm fine."
CS_CH4_Main_3_007,"Let's get rid of those enemies and continue on our way."
CS_CH4_Main_4_001,"Huff…huff…"
CS_CH4_Main_4_002,"You okay, Kasel? "
CS_CH4_Main_4_003,"Yeah I'm fine. They weren't that strong, really."
CS_CH4_Main_4_004,"Fufu, see? You are no more the kid who used to cry every time when faced with a skeleton model."
CS_CH4_Main_4_005,"Come on, Frey. Don't remind me of that."
CS_CH4_Main_4_006,"What is it, what is it??"
CS_CH4_Main_4_007,"When we were still children living at the orphanage,"
CS_CH4_Main_4_008,"the principal brought a skeleton model to class to teach us about the human body."
CS_CH4_Main_4_009,"Kasel got extremely frightened and started to cry."
CS_CH4_Main_4_010,"Everyone, including me started teasing him about being a crybaby…"
CS_CH4_Main_4_011,"Frey made fun of someone!? "
CS_CH4_Main_4_012,"Well, it was when she was young."
CS_CH4_Main_4_013,"On the other hand, I'd say your mental age is the same as back then..."
CS_CH4_Main_4_014,"*Sigh*…and you just complemented me moments ago…"
CS_CH4_Main_4_015,"It wasn't worth it, so yeah."
CS_CH4_Main_4_016,"When I heard the story of Kasel's family and the Demon invasion afterwards, I felt really bad about it…"
CS_CH4_Main_4_017,"Perhaps Lua gave me the task of helping Kasel,"
CS_CH4_Main_4_018,"because I made fun of him back then."
CS_CH4_Main_4_019,"Tiring, isn't it?"
CS_CH4_Main_4_020,"Pshhh..it was a joke, Kasel. A joke! "
CS_CH4_Main_4_021,"I don't know how you feel about it, but I am happy that Lua chose me."
CS_CH4_Main_4_022,"Oh…Frey is making jokes. This is new."
CS_CH4_Main_4_023,"Silly, wasn't I? Haha… old memories…"
CS_CH4_Main_4_024,"Silly, huh. If you think that's silly, just take a look at Cleo."
CS_CH4_Main_4_025,"Roi!!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_4_026,"It suits Cleo to be bright and cheerful. But I should act like a priest."
CS_CH4_Main_4_027,"Yes…because I am a priest,"
CS_CH4_Main_4_028,"I can follow the path Lua wants me to."
CS_CH4_Main_4_029,"But Kasel…"
CS_CH4_Main_4_030,"I suppose Lua wouldn't remove Kasel's burden even if I prayed for it…"
CS_CH4_Main_5_001,"Eww, what is that giant head?!"
CS_CH4_Main_5_002,"It looks like the skull of giants that lived here in ancient times. "
CS_CH4_Main_5_003,"Those actually existed…?"
CS_CH4_Main_5_004,"Before the Demons invaded 100 years ago,"
CS_CH4_Main_5_005,"people believed that the World of Light and Darkness were just fables and myths."
CS_CH4_Main_5_006,"The fact that legend of giants was true doesn't even surprise me now."
CS_CH4_Main_5_007,"*Sigh*…Malduk…"
CS_CH4_Main_5_008,"He really went and made all kinds of weird undead!"
CS_CH4_Main_5_009,"Malduk did this?"
CS_CH4_Main_5_010,"Yeah, stupid Roi wouldn't know, would he?"
CS_CH4_Main_5_011,"Malduk was Angmund's strategist, but he is also called the Father of Undead."
CS_CH4_Main_5_012,"He's the one who infused Demon souls into dead bodies."
CS_CH4_Main_5_013,"Some people say Malduk himself underwent the same process when he came to this world through the gate. "
CS_CH4_Main_5_014,"Those skeletons are much more difficult to deal with compared to living weapons,"
CS_CH4_Main_5_015,"probably because there were once alive, too."
CS_CH4_Main_6_001,"Hasn't it become darker around here?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_002,"Cleo…Can you feel this?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_003,"Yes…This is bad…I sense some really dangerous mana…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_004,"Dangerous mana… Referring to yourself, hmm?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_005,"Wh..Who are you!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_006,"I am you. The poor little girl with dangerous magic power, abandoned by her parents."
CS_CH4_Main_6_007,"What?! Don't make me laugh."
CS_CH4_Main_6_008,"Hahaha, yes, you too. I can't help laughing at the sight of you."
CS_CH4_Main_6_009,"You act big to hide your loneliness in the day, and cry over your mother in the night.. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_010,"You say you left to find your mother, but I know the truth. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_011,"You just didn't want to stay in the Tower of the Sage."
CS_CH4_Main_6_012,"All the people you hurt due to your powerful magic."
CS_CH4_Main_6_013,"You just wanted to run away from them and their cold gazes, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_014,"Now tell me. Are you really seeking for your mother?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_015,"The fact is, you're scared, aren't you? Scared of meeting your mother, the one who gave you your mana."
CS_CH4_Main_6_016,"The one who threw you away, even before you could remember her face/"
CS_CH4_Main_6_017,"What…who do you think you are?!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_018,"I'm Cleo. The poor, lonely girl who can't stop crying in her sleep without Frey."
CS_CH4_Main_6_019,"I'd rather fall asleep next to Frey forever than go through the painful search for my mom…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_020,"How long will that be possible…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_021,"You idiot! How can you call yourself an archmage, being tricked by something like this!?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_022,"Hahaha, like you ever acknowledged Cleo as an archmage."
CS_CH4_Main_6_023,"Who are you!? What is your goal?!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_024,"You still haven't figured it out?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_025,"I am you. The Dark Reaper, Roi."
CS_CH4_Main_6_026,"C'mon. It's dark outside, so it's time to go to work. Like any other time, the reward will be big."
CS_CH4_Main_6_027,"Considering we're taking the lives of upstanding people, there's no way the reward can be small, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_028,"Let's see… How much for the heads of those three idiots?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_029,"Shut up!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_030,"Shut up? What do you mean, shut up."
CS_CH4_Main_6_031,"You had this conversation a few years ago with your old Laughing Mask friends, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_032,"Stop…not in front of Cleo and the others…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_033,"Haha, why? Why not?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_034,"What are you afraid of? "
CS_CH4_Main_6_035,"Are you afraid that those naïve children following after the light will be disgusted of you for trading lives with money?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_036,"C'mon, Roi. You don't belong with them."
CS_CH4_Main_6_037,"You are the Dark Reaper."
CS_CH4_Main_6_038,"I… I……am…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_039,"The Roi of now doesn't do such things!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_040,"The past is the past!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_041,"Do you really think so?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_042,"The past is a mirror, reflecting your future self."
CS_CH4_Main_6_043,"Like how all those townspeople died…and like how Brian died,"
CS_CH4_Main_6_044,"people will continue to die because of you in the future."
CS_CH4_Main_6_045,"As long as the holy sword is in your hand, you cannot change that future. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_046,"So, let go of the sword."
CS_CH4_Main_6_047,"Buf if I do…this world will…."
CS_CH4_Main_6_048,"If you are that worried about the world, there is still a way."
CS_CH4_Main_6_049,"You must die."
CS_CH4_Main_6_050,"Yes, you."
CS_CH4_Main_6_051,"That way, the holy sword will be passed down to the true savior of the world."
CS_CH4_Main_6_052,"You always say you would give up your life to save others, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_053,"The lives of everyone of this world. You can save all of them, just by dying."
CS_CH4_Main_6_054,"Don't listen, Kasel!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_055,"Goddess Lua.. Please protect us. Bless us with your Light."
CS_CH4_Main_6_056,"I'm sorry, Frey. The goddess will never listen to your prayer."
CS_CH4_Main_6_057,"You know it… but you still recite your prayers, only in habit."
CS_CH4_Main_6_058,"Of course, you lived in the church…it's obvious you would pick up such habits."
CS_CH4_Main_6_059,"That's not true. My faith towards Lua is real! "
CS_CH4_Main_6_060,"Yes, you resent her for real. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_061,"Much like Clause, you resent her for giving Kasel such a heavy burden."
CS_CH4_Main_6_062,"I am you. I know everything about you."
CS_CH4_Main_6_063,"In fact, you resent her even more than Clause does because you have to continue following him around."
CS_CH4_Main_6_064,"That's not it. I appreciate the journey she's given to me. "
CS_CH4_Main_6_065,"*Sigh*…Frey, who would have guessed you would have become a priest."
CS_CH4_Main_6_066,"People are impossible to understand, due to their whimsical nature."
CS_CH4_Main_6_067,"You say you appreciate this journey, but till when?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_068,"As time goes, you will tire of it. And you will abandon Kasel."
CS_CH4_Main_6_069,"…You're right. I've changed my mind many times in my life…and it will continue to do so."
CS_CH4_Main_6_070,"But..that isn't the only driving force behind life."
CS_CH4_Main_6_071,"Even if my resolve is weak, I can regain it."
CS_CH4_Main_6_072,"The strength of strong will,"
CS_CH4_Main_6_073,"is the present that Lua has given to us!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_074,"Ah…ah…."
CS_CH4_Main_6_075,"No.. Please don't.. Frey…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_076,"I'm done…tired…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_077,"You need to follow your heart…where it leads you…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_078,"You said you were me?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_079,"That is a lie."
CS_CH4_Main_6_080,"One day, in the future, I may tire of everything."
CS_CH4_Main_6_081,"Perhaps then, I may suffer like you have said."
CS_CH4_Main_6_082,"But that time is not now. Right now…I am following my own path sincerely!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_083,"Your evil words will no longer enter my ears."
CS_CH4_Main_6_084,"By Lua's name, I command you. Leave now, Demon!!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_085,"Wow, telling me to leave just as I arrive is just mean, isn't it?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_086,"My, you are…"
CS_CH4_Main_6_087,"Are you behind all of this?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_088,"Nope, nope."
CS_CH4_Main_6_089,"I just came here to see what kind of fun things were happening inside Malduk's trap, as it was starting to break down."
CS_CH4_Main_6_090,"Malduk's trap!?"
CS_CH4_Main_6_091,"I'll tell you the details later."
CS_CH4_Main_6_092,"The darkness failed to consume you, so it'll try to attack you physically."
CS_CH4_Main_6_093,"Sour grapes, indeed."
CS_CH4_Main_6_094,"Look over there!"
CS_CH4_Main_6_095,"Now, its been a long time since I had some toys to have fun with."
CS_CH4_Main_7_001,"Fu~~~~it's been a long time since I've had such fun!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_002,"You seem to be one of the Demons, why are you helping us? "
CS_CH4_Main_7_003,"Us? Ah, are you friends with those dazed humans?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_004,"I guess I should wake them up."
CS_CH4_Main_7_005,"Let's see~ I'm Demon, so I should do it in a Demon-like way!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_006,"I guess they'll come to if I cut your throat with this scythe, ufufu…"
CS_CH4_Main_7_007,"Wh…What…?! You Demon..!!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_008,"Damn…and I thought she was trying to help us…"
CS_CH4_Main_7_009,"My dagger will be faster than your scythe, Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_7_010,"Success~!! Hahahaha."
CS_CH4_Main_7_011,"Wh..what?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_012,"C'mon, see? All of you woke up!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_013,"Why would I chop up this priest lady? She's too fun!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_014,"Hmm…It seems you're the youngest human to ever make a crack in Malduk's trap."
CS_CH4_Main_7_015,"Ah~You must be the most interesting human I met in a long time!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_016,"….Are you…Epis? The thrill seeking Demon?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_017,"Oho, you know me?"
CS_CH4_Main_7_018,"Epis!!? Wow, I get to meet Epis!! Journeying around with Kasel sure has its perks!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_019,"The Demon Hero who helped save this world 100 years ago after passing through the Gate,"
CS_CH4_Main_7_020,"only because this world was 'fun'…."
CS_CH4_Main_7_021,"Are you really that Epis??"
CS_CH4_Main_7_022,"Hahaha, you humans are really funny!"
CS_CH4_Main_7_023,"Even when your lifespans are so short, you like to remember the past."
CS_CH4_Main_8_001,"So that…was a trap made by Malduk?"
CS_CH4_Main_8_002,"Yep."
CS_CH4_Main_8_003,"It's a magic trap that materializes the inner darkness of any sapient lifeform, in order to corrupt them."
CS_CH4_Main_8_004,"Malduk… How distasteful."
CS_CH4_Main_8_005,"I agree. Still, I think that trap isn't a solo job by Malduk."
CS_CH4_Main_8_006,"Think about it. We used to exist in a place with no life."
CS_CH4_Main_8_007,"It's not possible that a Demon would just know how to analyze the inner darkness of a living being without prior experience."
CS_CH4_Main_8_008,"That makes sense."
CS_CH4_Main_8_009,"So somebody from this world helped the Demons…"
CS_CH4_Main_8_010,"Who in the world would…"
CS_CH4_Main_8_011,"The one who opened the Gate was a human."
CS_CH4_Main_8_012,"Legend says it was some crazy mage that made a mistake…"
CS_CH4_Main_8_013,"But perhaps he was actually with the Demons…"
CS_CH4_Main_8_014,"Malduk…"
CS_CH4_Main_8_015,"He laid low for quite some time, but apparently he used this trap in Ogria recently as well."
CS_CH4_Main_8_016,"In Ogria?!!"
CS_CH4_Main_8_017,"Yeah, apparently there was an Orc suffering a huge inferiority complex towards humans."
CS_CH4_Main_8_018,"He was asking why the Goddess favored humans, or something.around those lines."
CS_CH4_Main_8_019,"That makes no sense. The Goddess loves all races equally."
CS_CH4_Main_8_020,"Excuse me, lady? I'm a Demon, so I don't know about those things."
CS_CH4_Main_8_021,"But the Holy Sword itself is an issue."
CS_CH4_Main_8_022,"The Orcs were proud to consider themselves the strongest warriors,"
CS_CH4_Main_8_023,"but then Lua went and granted the humans the holy sword 100 years ago."
CS_CH4_Main_8_024,"Apparently that was a part of the issue."
CS_CH4_Main_8_025,"So they were thinking about that…"
CS_CH4_Main_8_026,"So then the strongest warrior went and fell into that particular trap."
CS_CH4_Main_8_027,"…Sieg?"
CS_CH4_Main_8_028,"Yeah. I think that’s the name."
CS_CH4_Main_8_029,"Ugh… So when you get caught in that trap, you turn as stubborn as a brick wall."
CS_CH4_Main_8_030,"No need to worry, Cleo."
CS_CH4_Main_8_031,"Your bullheadedness is already enough to give anyone indigestion and constipation at the same time."
CS_CH4_Main_8_032,"Roi, you jerk!!"
CS_CH4_Main_8_033,"Um.. You guys…? I have a question."
CS_CH4_Main_8_034,"I know what being stubborn or bullheaded means, even indigestion, but what is constipation?"
CS_CH4_Main_8_035,"…This….I must record this!"
CS_CH4_Main_8_036,"Demons don't know what constipation is, thus they don't have to go to the toilet…"
CS_CH4_Main_9_001,"Whoa! Hey, you!"
CS_CH4_Main_9_002,"Sorry?"
CS_CH4_Main_9_003,"You…that sword…it's Aea?!"
CS_CH4_Main_9_004,"Ah…come to think of it, you were Kyle's friend, so you would know about this sword."
CS_CH4_Main_9_005,"You…you cute little brat."
CS_CH4_Main_9_006,"And to think you were playing dumb while we were talking about the past before."
CS_CH4_Main_9_007,"I just thought it would be better that the people didn't know the holy sword had reappeard,"
CS_CH4_Main_9_008,"so it became a habit not to speak of it when the topic came up."
CS_CH4_Main_9_009,"You humans sure are a headache."
CS_CH4_Main_9_010,"Well, that's part of what makes you interesting. Fufufu.."
CS_CH4_Main_9_011,"That trap from before…if Malduk was responsible of it,"
CS_CH4_Main_9_012,"is he still around in Galluah?"
CS_CH4_Main_9_013,"Most likely, yes."
CS_CH4_Main_9_014,"He probably already received a report about you all from the skeletons around here."
CS_CH4_Main_10_001,"Hm? Those Golems..they feel different from the others we've seen so far."
CS_CH4_Main_10_002,"Do you think they still hold the power of the dukedoms of the past?"
CS_CH4_Main_10_003,"Hmm..I don't know much about the magic of that era,"
CS_CH4_Main_10_004,"but that is the most likely conclusion."
CS_CH4_Main_11_001,"Hmm…those golems seem to be guarding that coffin."
CS_CH4_Main_11_002,"A coffin, eh? Isn't that what you humans throw your dead into?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_003,"Those are ceremonial rites."
CS_CH4_Main_11_004,"I'm a Demon, don't expect me to understand all your customs and courtesies."
CS_CH4_Main_11_005,"This is the Material World, where life and death go hand in hand."
CS_CH4_Main_11_006,"Since you are in our world, you would be expected to follow our customs."
CS_CH4_Main_11_007,"Yeah! You're here now, so act like it!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_008,"It just doesn't click when you talk about customs and courtesies, Cleo."
CS_CH4_Main_11_008_0,"Why?!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_009,"Ack!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_010,"The corpse walked out of its coffin!!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_011,"Get lost…Demons…"
CS_CH4_Main_11_012,"Eh? Why is she calling us Demons?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_013,"Oh, right. Epis is a Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_11_014,"In that case…"
CS_CH4_Main_11_015,"Let's get out of here, Cleo. It seems this is a fight between Demon and Undead."
CS_CH4_Main_11_016,"We have nothing to do with this."
CS_CH4_Main_11_017,"What was that for, you jerk!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_018,"Did you forget what I did with that trap for you?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_019,"Nah, I just thought a corpse would be nothing for you… "
CS_CH4_Main_11_020,"C'mon, battles are only fun when done together!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_021,"Do you think it would be fun for me to just wait alone for my mana gauge to fill up and then spam skills?!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_022,"Ri…right."
CS_CH4_Main_11_023,"Kuku, did Roi just get yelled at by a Demon hero?"
CS_CH4_Main_11_024,"Shut up! We don't know what this enemy can do."
CS_CH4_Main_11_025,"Stay focused, or we may lose!"
CS_CH4_Main_11_026,"Boooooring."
CS_CH4_Main_11_027,"Fufu, I think it's funny. See, he's trying to cover up his embarassment with a façade of seriousness!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_001,"Kyahaha, you're quite interesting! An undead using its coffin as a weapon..! "
CS_CH4_Main_12_002,"Did Malduk make you, too?"
CS_CH4_Main_12_003,"Malduk..!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_004,"Hm? She's reacting to Malduk's name."
CS_CH4_Main_12_005,"Who…was that? I don't remember anything…I only know I must destroy Demons..."
CS_CH4_Main_12_006,"The name…Malduk….kind of familiar…"
CS_CH4_Main_12_007,"Really? We are looking for Malduk. Do you want to come with us? "
CS_CH4_Main_12_008,"Excuse me, we are not looking for Malduk. "
CS_CH4_Main_12_009,"We were on our way to the Barbarian Kingdom, it just so happened that we passed by here."
CS_CH4_Main_12_010,"Come on~ don't be a party pooper."
CS_CH4_Main_12_011,"If the hero of the holy sword heard that Malduk was in Galluah,"
CS_CH4_Main_12_012,"wouldn't it be obvious that he should go check it out?"
CS_CH4_Main_12_013,"Well, we didn't consider that."
CS_CH4_Main_12_014,"But it seems we'll meet him even if we didn't want to."
CS_CH4_Main_12_015,"Considering he even set up a trap for us…"
CS_CH4_Main_12_016,"I guess you're right."
CS_CH4_Main_12_017,"However…I don't think letting her meet Malduk is a good plan."
CS_CH4_Main_12_018,"Why? I think it would be a fun sight."
CS_CH4_Main_12_019,"Malduk…I want to meet…"
CS_CH4_Main_12_020,"See? The Undead lady wants to meet him!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_021,"C'mon, lets go!"
CS_CH4_Main_12_022,"This is exciting!! I wonder what fun things will happen when they meet…"
CS_CH4_Main_13_001,"Hmm…"
CS_CH4_Main_13_002,"What's the matter?"
CS_CH4_Main_13_003,"I'd thought this undead lady was made by Malduk.."
CS_CH4_Main_13_004,"But it's odd."
CS_CH4_Main_13_005,"This isn't how Malduk does things!"
CS_CH4_Main_13_006,"Look! I found something!"
CS_CH4_Main_13_007,"There's a name written on the coffin. 'Jane Gray?'"
CS_CH4_Main_13_008,"I suppose it's her name when she was alive."
CS_CH4_Main_13_009,"Then.."
CS_CH4_Main_13_010,"Do you know something?"
CS_CH4_Main_13_011,"When the Demons invaded this world, "
CS_CH4_Main_13_012,"There was a particular dukedom ruled by some people named the Grays fought back against the Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_13_013,"This lady must be part of that country."
CS_CH4_Main_13_014,"Gray…"
CS_CH4_Main_13_015,"Then those guardian golems…"
CS_CH4_Main_13_016,"They were probably trying to guard Jane Grey as golems of the Dukedom."
CS_CH4_Main_13_017,"Is that why Jane was hostile towards Epis right after waking up?"
CS_CH4_Main_13_018,"At that time, it was just fun to kill things here."
CS_CH4_Main_13_019,"Well, it hadn't been long since I had received a body..."
CS_CH4_Main_13_020,"We just did anything Angmund asked of us…everything was fun."
CS_CH4_Main_13_021,"Sorry to make you remember…"
CS_CH4_Main_13_022,"Eh, please. I'm still a Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_13_023,"I don't feel as much guilt as you may assume."
CS_CH4_Main_13_024,"No need for you to make that face."
CS_CH4_Main_13_025,"For a Demon, you sure read faces well."
CS_CH4_Main_13_026,"Come on, I lived far longer here in this world than any of you."
CS_CH4_Main_13_027,"Facial Expressions… are easy to read. I consider myself better than most humans in that regard."
CS_CH4_Main_13_028,"But…"
CS_CH4_Main_13_029,"This one here, even I can't figure out what she's thinking."
CS_CH4_Main_14_001,"Malduk…!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_002,"It's been a long time~ Malduk."
CS_CH4_Main_14_003,"You… the traitor, Epis!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_004,"Fufu, isn't it nice? Reminds me of the old times."
CS_CH4_Main_14_005,"You…you…how did you find the holy sword, Aea?!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_006,"Eh, rather than finding it…it just came by like fate?"
CS_CH4_Main_14_007,"Fufu, even though I'm a Demon, "
CS_CH4_Main_14_008,"I sure must have some kind of connection with the Goddess of these parts, Lua."
CS_CH4_Main_14_009,"Hmph… At any rate, I will deal with you later, traitor."
CS_CH4_Main_14_010,"I have some urgent business to take care of. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_011,"You…are Malduk?"
CS_CH4_Main_14_012,"Yes I am, my daughter."
CS_CH4_Main_14_013,"I am your father. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_014,"Father…"
CS_CH4_Main_14_015,"Psh…well."
CS_CH4_Main_14_016,"Considering you are called the Father of Undead, that really isn't untrue..."
CS_CH4_Main_14_017,"However…my daughter, you have been sullied."
CS_CH4_Main_14_018,"Who tainted you to this extent?"
CS_CH4_Main_14_019,"I…dirty…"
CS_CH4_Main_14_020,"Don't listen to that bastard, Jane! "
CS_CH4_Main_14_021,"You were a human long ago. He only raised you from the dead!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_022,"She's right, Miss Jane. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_023,"Malduk had disgraced your eternal sleep."
CS_CH4_Main_14_024,"But… I…feel…stuffy…"
CS_CH4_Main_14_025,"I don't remember anything but the name…Malduk…"
CS_CH4_Main_14_026,"Yes, follow me, your father. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_027,"You have no one but me."
CS_CH4_Main_14_028,"Jane, Malduk is a Demon. You wanted to get rid of the Demons, remember? "
CS_CH4_Main_14_029,"My daughter, you can eliminate the Demons anytime you want. "
CS_CH4_Main_14_030,"When you get your memory back…"
CS_CH4_Main_14_031,"if you still feel the Demons must be purged, then I will die happily by your hand."
CS_CH4_Main_14_032,"Don't lie, Malduk!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_033,"I'll come with you, Malduk."
CS_CH4_Main_14_034,"Good bye, everyone."
CS_CH4_Main_14_035,"No, Jane!"
CS_CH4_Main_14_036,"My daughter, no need to be sad. You will meet them again soon."
CS_CH4_Main_15_001,"Frey was right. We shouldn't have let Jane meet Malduk..!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_002,"Hmm. I think differently."
CS_CH4_Main_15_003,"Thanks to this turn of events, I have an interesting hypothesis"
CS_CH4_Main_15_004,"An interersting hypothesis~!? You demon!!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_005,"No wait, you are a demon! You devil!!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_006,"How can be so hedonistic even as we lost Jane to Malduk!!"
CS_CH4_Main_15_007,"Malduk's goal from the start…was probably Jane."
CS_CH4_Main_15_008,"Even if we didn't bring her here, Malduk would have found her anyway…"
CS_CH4_Main_15_009,"Okay, so what is this 'interesting hypothesis'?"
CS_CH4_Main_15_010,"Malduk said Jane had been tainted. "
CS_CH4_Main_15_011,"Malduk probably is the one that turned Jane into an Undead…"
CS_CH4_Main_15_012,"but it seems someone else tampered with her and overrode the magic on her body."
CS_CH4_Main_15_013,"If that is true…does it mean it is possible to grant a personality to undead?"
CS_CH4_Main_15_014,"Perhaps."
CS_CH4_Main_15_015,"I didn't consider that much, but it makes sense."
CS_CH4_Main_15_016,"If that's so, I wonder who cast such magic on Jane..."
CS_CH4_Main_15_017,"Considering she remembers parts of her past…"
CS_CH4_Main_16_001,"Eh, Malduk? You were still in Galluah?"
CS_CH4_Main_16_002,"Kukuku, did you really think I'd ignore the wielder of the holy sword?"
CS_CH4_Main_16_003,"Where is Jane? "
CS_CH4_Main_16_004,"You'll meet my daughter soon."
CS_CH4_Main_16_005,"Because you will become my sons and daughters, too!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_16_006,"That's preposterous! "
CS_CH4_Main_17_001,"Kuhahahaha, you fight well, even when you haven't completed the power of the holy sword."
CS_CH4_Main_17_002,"As a reward, I will let you meet my daughter."
CS_CH4_Main_18_001,"Jane!"
CS_CH4_Main_18_002,"My daughter and loyal subordinate. 'His' useful tool."
CS_CH4_Main_18_003,"It is time to repay his grace."
CS_CH4_Main_18_004,"This 'He' seems quite famous."
CS_CH4_Main_18_005,"Perhaps…the Dark Lord, Angmund?"
CS_CH4_Main_18_006,"No, that's impossible. I didn't feel his power in 100 years."
CS_CH4_Main_18_007,"In the time we existed in the World of Darkness, we could always feel his power somewhere."
CS_CH4_Main_18_008,"I don't know if he is really dead, or has gone back to the World of Darkness,"
CS_CH4_Main_18_009,"but since he disappeared from this world, no Demon ever felt his presence anymore."
CS_CH4_Main_18_010,"Hello, everyone."
CS_CH4_Main_18_011,"Let's be together with Him…"
CS_CH4_Main_18_012,"Accept your death, and wake up again…"
CS_CH4_Main_18_013,"Your death…I will grant..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_014,"No…!"
CS_CH4_Main_18_015,"Wake up, Jane!!"
CS_CH4_Main_18_016,"Accept it, Cleo. Jane Gray is already a dead person. "
CS_CH4_Main_18_017,"He's right, Cleo. "
CS_CH4_Main_18_018,"If Jane tries to kill us… we can only fight her back..."
CS_CH4_Main_18_019,"No matter what… "
CS_CH4_Main_18_020,"the burden we carry now is that of the world."
CS_CH4_Main_18_021,"Yes…"
CS_CH4_Main_18_022,"We're sorry, Jane. We can't die yet."
CS_CH4_Main_18_023,"And more than anything, we won't become the puppets of Demons!!!"
CS_CH4_Main_19_001,"Kuhahahaha, the holy sword is still powerful even when incomplete. "
CS_CH4_Main_19_002,"But you guys are yet too weak…weak to be of help to 'Him'."
CS_CH4_Main_19_003,"I don't know who that is, but we will never help the Demons!!"
CS_CH4_Main_19_004,"Fufu, when did I ever ask you to be of help to Demons."
CS_CH4_Main_19_005,"Fools, who don't even know who their true enemy is..Kuhahaha."
CS_CH4_Main_19_006,"Thank you for this sample of your strength."
CS_CH4_Main_19_007,"I will use this experience well, in the future. Hahahaha…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_001,"*Sigh*….Not again…he ran off again!!"
CS_CH4_Main_20_002,"Jane, you're still alive!!"
CS_CH4_Main_20_003,"I'm…not..alive…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_004,"Oh, right…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_005,"So you don't want to kill us anymore..?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_006,"You rejected to become like me…."
CS_CH4_Main_20_007,"I hate you…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_008,"I don't need you all…."
CS_CH4_Main_20_009,"Is she...mad?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_010,"Hmm… I can't read her."
CS_CH4_Main_20_011,"I guess I still have ways to go."
CS_CH4_Main_20_012,"I doubt even a thousand-year old sage would be able to read the expressions of a dead body."
CS_CH4_Main_20_013,"Jane, you received 'His' grace…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_014,"Do you know who that is?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_015,"Won't tell you…I hate you..."
CS_CH4_Main_20_016,"Come on, this is ridiculous…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_017,"See, Jane. I'm a Demon."
CS_CH4_Main_20_018,"Technically, Undead are also Demons. So why not tell me?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_019,"Demon working with people I hate…I don't need you…"
CS_CH4_Main_20_020,"*Sigh*…Heroes of Light, I think we need a little time to ourselves."
CS_CH4_Main_20_021,"Us of the Darkness need some time…to do a little bonding."
CS_CH4_Main_20_022,"Persuade her…please."
CS_CH4_Main_20_023,"I dunno how it will go. Well, can't be helped even if it goes wrong."
CS_CH4_Main_20_024,"Jane Gray is an interesting one."
CS_CH4_Main_20_025,"Even if I don't learn who 'He' is, it will be fun."
CS_CH4_Main_20_026,"I mean, you all are fun too, but this seems a little more interesting."
CS_CH4_Main_20_027,"Sorry, Jane. We need to go now."
CS_CH4_Main_20_028,"When you don't feel mad anymore, I would like it if you came with us."
CS_CH4_Main_20_029,"I'll bring her along when she stops pouting."
CS_CH4_Main_20_030,"You were all headed for the Barbarian Kingdom, right?"
CS_CH4_Main_20_031,"In that case, you need to pass through Arrovina."
CS_CH4_Main_20_032,"Exactly, yes."
CS_CH4_Main_20_033,"I'll see you all later."
CS_CH4_Main_20_034,"I'll be expecting good news. "
CS_CH5_Main_0_001,"I thought the weather would be better once we left Galluah, but it seems I was mistaken."
CS_CH5_Main_0_002,"Because Galluah was corrupted with dark magic, light does not spread well."
CS_CH5_Main_0_003,"Arrovina on the other hand, is naturally dim."
CS_CH5_Main_0_004,"The rain and fog blots out the sun most of the time."
CS_CH5_Main_0_005,"There is a theory that the elves of this area adapted to the environment,"
CS_CH5_Main_0_006,"and because of that their skin color became dark…well, it's just an unproven hypothesis."
CS_CH5_Main_0_007,"I heard that the current King of the Dark Elves is pretty young."
CS_CH5_Main_0_008,"Young in comparison to the general lifespan of an elf, you mean. He's still 130 years old."
CS_CH5_Main_0_009,"I heard most of the royal bloodline died during the Demon invasion."
CS_CH5_Main_0_010,"Only one prince made it out alive. King Temorel was 30 years old back then."
CS_CH5_Main_0_011,"He is the current ruler of Dark Elves. "
CS_CH5_Sub_1_001,"My, what a cute little turtle."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_002,"I heard turtles are really delicious when cooked well. .."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_003,"Wait…"
CS_CH5_Sub_1_004,"That lion…seems to be controlled by the darkness."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_005,"It's not an ordinary lion, that’s for sure."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_006,"Is that what a fully corrupted animal looks like? "
CS_CH5_Sub_1_007,"That is a case of enhancement through complete corruption."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_008,"That is what happens when the corruption succeeds, instead of failing and turning into the Dark Disease."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_009,"I hear corrupted animals affect any other animals nearby, turning them into ferocious beasts."
CS_CH5_Sub_1_010,"Then…"
CS_CH5_Sub_1_011,"We have to fight that cute turtle…"
CS_CH5_Sub_1_012,"On the plus side, we can make some turtle soup…"
CS_CH5_Sub_1_013,"*Sigh*…Kasel…"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_001,"Considering our current goal is to reach the Aegina Desert…"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_002,"Would it be faster to go north?"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_003,"The land looks rather unstable around that path."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_004,"Cleo, can we fly the distance using your magic staff, like before?"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_005,"I'm against that."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_006,"Fufu, Roi seemed to quite scared last time."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_007,"Well, I won't deny it wasn't very pleasant."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_008,"Also, it seemed you were having a hard time flying as it is last time."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_009,"Considering we don't know how far the unstable ground will last…"
CS_CH5_Sub_2_010,"It could be dangerous to fly off without properly gauging the distance."
CS_CH5_Sub_2_011,"True. Well then, even if we have to take a longer detour, shall we walk south?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_001,"Those are... Gnolls.!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_002,"*Sigh*…what a troublesome race."
CS_CH5_Main_1_003,"Hmm, so even Frey has a race she dislikes?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_004,"Well, it's not like I dislike them…"
CS_CH5_Main_1_005,"After all, Lua preaches; 'Condemn the sin but not the perpetrator'."
CS_CH5_Main_1_006,"This goes for all intellectual species, not just humans…but."
CS_CH5_Main_1_007,"Those Gnolls are just really hopeless.."
CS_CH5_Main_1_008,"Gnolls are naturally greedy and savage."
CS_CH5_Main_1_009,"During the Demon invasion, while all the other races were busy fighting against the Demons,"
CS_CH5_Main_1_010,"the Gnolls took advantage of the chaos and went about looting and plundering."
CS_CH5_Main_1_011,"Hmm… Roi. Despite your general stupidity, you seem to know a lot about the Gnolls!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_012,"Um…Actually…I used to have do business with the Gnolls often."
CS_CH5_Main_1_013,"Considering they fight between themselves all the time as well, there were a lot of assassination requests."
CS_CH5_Main_1_014,"Uh….sorry…"
CS_CH5_Main_1_015,"Don't be."
CS_CH5_Main_1_016,"It's me who should be thankful for all of you, putting up with me despite my dark past."
CS_CH5_Main_1_017,"…Uh, what's with this atmosphere?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_018,"Eh…um…well. Even though we know you aren't a cold person…"
CS_CH5_Main_1_019,"It's my first time seeing Roi... expressing his appreciation."
CS_CH5_Main_1_020,"…Is it?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_021,"Yeah, Roi. Be thankful about stuff more often!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_022,"You scared me for a second there!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_023,"Eh…sorry, I guess?"
CS_CH5_Main_1_024,"Haha, humans!!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_025,"Kyakyak! Cough up all your valuables or die!"
CS_CH5_Main_1_026,"*Sigh*....Frey was right… They really are hopeless."
CS_CH5_Main_1_027,"And the mood was just so good…what a waste."
CS_CH5_Main_2_001,"Hmm, it's odd that the Gnolls are this active around this area."
CS_CH5_Main_2_002,"They may be brutes, but considering their lack of intelligence…"
CS_CH5_Main_2_003,"What are the Dark Elves doing? This is their land, Arrovina... "
CS_CH5_Main_2_004,"Perhaps…there are some ongoing issues."
CS_CH5_Main_2_005,"Perhaps this will be a harder journey than expected."
CS_CH5_Main_2_006,"This is all because of Roi's acrophobia!"
CS_CH5_Main_2_007,"No, its because your flight magic is lacking."
CS_CH5_Main_2_008,"*Sigh*…and we had such a good mood going…"
CS_CH5_Main_2_009,"The Gnolls ruined everything!"
CS_CH5_Main_3_001,"Look..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_3_002,"A Dark Elf is surrounded by Gnolls!"
CS_CH5_Main_3_003,"We should save him, Kasel. "
CS_CH5_Main_4_001,"Excuse my belated apology."
CS_CH5_Main_4_002,"Shoot, we missed him."
CS_CH5_Main_4_003,"You, outsiders."
CS_CH5_Main_4_004,"Oh, yes, we are…"
CS_CH5_Main_4_005,"For helping a wanted criminal get away, we banish you from Arrovina."
CS_CH5_Main_4_006,"What? No way..!"
CS_CH5_Main_4_008,"Ugh.."
CS_CH5_Main_4_009,"Who's there? "
CS_CH5_Main_4_010,"Criminal, hah! What a load of crap. Shame on you! "
CS_CH5_Main_4_011,"Ugh!!!"
CS_CH5_Main_4_012,"Die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_4_013,"Hmph, you won't kill me with that kind of aim."
CS_CH5_Main_4_014,"I will remember your face."
CS_CH5_Main_4_015,"Tch, bastards."
CS_CH5_Main_4_016,"Outsiders. The Arrovina that was ruled by Dark Elves is done for."
CS_CH5_Main_4_017,"You better leave now."
CS_CH5_Main_5_001,"...What just happened?"
CS_CH5_Main_5_002,"The situation seems to complicated."
CS_CH5_Main_5_003,"We should go, fast."
CS_CH5_Sub_3_001,"The Dark Disease…!"
CS_CH5_Sub_3_002,"I see…so that guy was speaking the truth."
CS_CH5_Sub_3_003,"Yeah, the Dark Elves wouldn't just leave infected animals about in the open."
CS_CH5_Sub_3_004,"What has happened to Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_001,"Treants? This is not a forest, why would they even be here?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_002,"That is..a corrupted Treant."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_003,"It must have lost its way and wandered all over here."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_004,"Hmm…did it come here from Elidora?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_005,"No, this Treant must have been corrupted hundred years ago."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_006,"Aren't Treants intellectual life-forms?"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_007,"I thought it was impossible for sapient beings to be corrupted…"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_008,"There are some Treants that start losing their intelligence after a certain age."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_009,"Those Treants usually go into a deep sleep, not unlike hibernation."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_010,"Angmund then inserted the soul of Demons inside those sleeping Treants."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_011,"Angmund, that bastard."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_012,"What a cruel thing to do!!"
CS_CH5_Sub_4_013,"We can only help them…by returning them to their slumber."
CS_CH5_Sub_4_014,"Goddess, Lua. Please embrace the spirits of the forest we return to you."
CS_CH5_Main_6_001,"Kyakyak! Look at yourselves! That's what you get for underestimating us!!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_002,"Now, die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_003,"Stop!!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_004,"Eh? Who are you?!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_005,"Mind your own business. Or do you want to become our food?!"
CS_CH5_Main_6_006,"They won't stop even when told to."
CS_CH5_Main_6_007,"Hmph! I'll make you regret even being born!!"
CS_CH5_Main_7_001,"Thank you, kind travellers."
CS_CH5_Main_7_002,"How did Dark Elves have trouble with mere Gnolls?"
CS_CH5_Main_7_003,"I've heard that the Demons are backing the Gnolls."
CS_CH5_Main_7_004,"Hahh…Gnolls again.."
CS_CH5_Main_7_005,"What has brought you all to in Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Main_7_006,"We are on our way to the Arrovina Desert."
CS_CH5_Main_7_007,"I see. As a show of gratitude, please let us show you the way."
CS_CH5_Main_8_001,"We must go South."
CS_CH5_Main_8_002,"Follow us. "
CS_CH5_Main_8_003,"Wait…Aegina is supposed to be westwards."
CS_CH5_Main_8_004,"The Gnolls have taken over the path, besides all the corrupted wildlife."
CS_CH5_Main_8_005,"The path south is far safer."
CS_CH5_Main_8_006,"Go on ahead. We will catch up soon."
CS_CH5_Main_8_007,"I don't know if we should follow them at all."
CS_CH5_Main_8_008,"Even if the Gnolls are backed by the Demons, it doesn't make sense for them to be as active as they are."
CS_CH5_Main_8_009,"Also….the case with that 'criminal'…everything is just so fishy."
CS_CH5_Main_8_010,"It also doesn't make sense that the Dark Elf from before tried to banish us from Arrovina off the bat."
CS_CH5_Main_8_011,"The west is close to the forest, however. It is probably true that it is dangerous."
CS_CH5_Main_8_012,"If both ways are risky, it is better to follow the Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_8_013,"We have a better chance in open areas."
CS_CH5_Main_8_014,"Alright. Let's do that."
CS_CH5_Main_8_015,"Everyone, just be on your guard."
CS_CH5_Main_9_001,"Wait…this feeling…"
CS_CH5_Main_9_002,"Cleo.. Can you feel it, too?"
CS_CH5_Main_9_003,"Yeah, its the same feeling that I had in Ellidora.."
CS_CH5_Main_9_004,"It's a magical power just like the Nucleus of Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_9_005,"Dark Elves, how many of those things are in Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Main_9_006,"The power is similar to that of the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_9_007,"Tch, you found out."
CS_CH5_Main_9_008,"So you show your true colors."
CS_CH5_Main_9_009,"I have no clue what you came here for, but if you know about these wards…you must die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_10_001,"Hmph, you fight well."
CS_CH5_Main_10_002,"I apologize for telling you to leave Arrovina. I underestimated you."
CS_CH5_Main_10_003,"Can you tell us what has happened?"
CS_CH5_Main_10_004,"Why are the Dark Elves utilizing the power of Darkness?"
CS_CH5_Main_10_005,"The Ward you just destroyed was built by the order of the new Queen, El-Rosed. "
CS_CH5_Main_10_006,"A Queen?"
CS_CH5_Main_10_007,"The Royalty Palace has gone mad. It's totally out of control. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_001,"A Queen…? That's kind of confusing."
CS_CH5_Main_11_002,"Communication with the outer world was cut ever since the Queen ascended to the throne."
CS_CH5_Main_11_003,"Where is King Timorel..?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_004,"Hmph, that coward must have run away a long time ago."
CS_CH5_Main_11_005,"He was too young when he became king, and he was always terrified of the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_11_006,"When the rumors about the Demons reappearing started circulating, he went mad."
CS_CH5_Main_11_007,"He sacrificed many of his people to the Demons just to keep himself safe."
CS_CH5_Main_11_008,"That's crazy!"
CS_CH5_Main_11_009,"How did that happen?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_010,"Even as he sacrificed his people, another one claiming to be of royal blood appeared."
CS_CH5_Main_11_011,"Her name was El-Rosed. King Temorel passed on the crown to her immediately, and then fled."
CS_CH5_Main_11_012,"However, nothing changed."
CS_CH5_Main_11_013,"She went on to install strange wards all around Arrovina, controlling those idiots."
CS_CH5_Main_11_014,"It doesn't quite look like they are being controlled."
CS_CH5_Main_11_015,"I mean, when this happened in Elidora, they were killing each other…"
CS_CH5_Main_11_016,"Perhaps its more alike the trap we've seen in Galluah…"
CS_CH5_Main_11_017,"Sieg looked fine on the outside, remember?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_018,"The Queen…may not be true royalty."
CS_CH5_Main_11_019,"At any rate, the wards seem to make the Dark Elves blindly loyal to their queen."
CS_CH5_Main_11_020,"Do the Elves of Arrovina know that King Temorel has sacrificed his people to the Demons?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_021,"Only the soldiers involved would know."
CS_CH5_Main_11_022,"Then how do you know? "
CS_CH5_Main_11_023,"After there were Demon sightings reported, I was dispatched to the Aegina Desert."
CS_CH5_Main_11_024,"I was taken prisoner, but a woman named 'Maria' told me about all this."
CS_CH5_Main_11_025,"Maria..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_11_026,"Do you know her?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_027,"An ill-fated relationship, if I ever saw one."
CS_CH5_Main_11_028,"Where is that witch?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_029,"She saved my life. If you have a bone to pick with her, then I don't see why I should tell you."
CS_CH5_Main_11_030,"Although, if you help me…I'll at least consider the notion."
CS_CH5_Main_11_031,"What is it that you want?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_032,"Well, nothing much. You just have to fight the Dark Elves with me. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_033,"Also, don't ever think of going north. It's too dangerous. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_034,"Is it because of the Gnolls and the corrupted wildlife?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_035,"Did those cowards make up those excuses?"
CS_CH5_Main_11_036,"The Queen is hiding herself behind her army."
CS_CH5_Main_11_037,"That's another reason nobody outside of Arrovina knows much about this issue."
CS_CH5_Main_11_038,"Anyway, the reason I said it's dangerous up north is because of Black Thorn Fortress. "
CS_CH5_Main_11_039,"The Queen must have already heard the news about you,"
CS_CH5_Main_11_040,"and the soldiers around the fortress will try to stop you."
CS_CH5_Main_12_001,"Fufufu, so many idiots, just asking to be killed."
CS_CH5_Main_12_002,"There is no need to kill them. We'll merely be making our way through them."
CS_CH5_Main_12_003,"Hmm, are you saying you can win without needing to kill anyone?"
CS_CH5_Main_12_004,"Lets try to keep the number of casualties to the minimum."
CS_CH5_Main_12_005,"Or, our Priest will…"
CS_CH5_Main_12_006,"Hah, I see. Minimal casualties, you say…"
CS_CH5_Main_13_001,"Die, filth!!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_002,"Kugh..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_003,"You swine, you dare sell out your own race just because of an idiot's royal decree?!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_004,"Even death is too good for you!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_005,"Stop, Dimael!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_006,"You're going too far against people who have already lost any means to fight!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_007,"Hah. I'm just keeping casualties to a minimum, right?"
CS_CH5_Main_13_008,"But you're finishing them off when you don't need to!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_009,"If that's how you are going to do things, leave us. Or do you want to fight us this time?"
CS_CH5_Main_13_010,"Then you won't hear anything about Maria. "
CS_CH5_Main_13_011,"We don't need to."
CS_CH5_Main_13_012,"If we let these elves live, they'll just report everything to the Queen, and they'll be back with bigger reinforcements."
CS_CH5_Main_13_013,"Don't say 'We'. "
CS_CH5_Main_13_014,"We don't want to be involved with a cruel person like you."
CS_CH5_Main_13_015,"And I tried to warn you, but you cut me off."
CS_CH5_Main_13_016,"Our Priest is quite scary, you know."
CS_CH5_Main_13_017,"I don't understand you. Why do you leave risks as such behind?"
CS_CH5_Main_13_018,"It is me who can't understand you."
CS_CH5_Main_13_019,"Why are you so eager to kill your own kind?!"
CS_CH5_Main_13_020,"We'll talk about this later. "
CS_CH5_Main_13_021,"The reinforcements are here."
CS_CH5_Main_14_001,"As things have settled down a bit, I think it's time for a little talk, Dimael."
CS_CH5_Main_14_002,"Hmph, and you were all so eager to leave me just a while ago."
CS_CH5_Main_14_003,"Well, you probably have your reasons."
CS_CH5_Main_14_004,"Like perhaps someone close to you was sacrificed to the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_14_005,"…I guess I was right."
CS_CH5_Main_14_006,"I thought you said people with no ties were the only ones selected as sacrifices?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_007,"My records say I was killed in Aegina."
CS_CH5_Main_14_008,"So Epigael… my sister and only family was…"
CS_CH5_Main_14_009,"So your sister was sacrificed to the Demons…"
CS_CH5_Main_14_010,"Yes. At first, I didn't understand what this 'sacrifice' meant."
CS_CH5_Main_14_011,"I thought I could find her. Get her back."
CS_CH5_Main_14_012,"But…what the Demons wanted was to create Undead. Sacrifices…meant dead bodies."
CS_CH5_Main_14_013,"Undead…"
CS_CH5_Main_14_014,"Malduk, that bastard..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_14_015,"I see…sorry for being so harsh with you."
CS_CH5_Main_14_016,"But Dimael, hatred will only ruin you."
CS_CH5_Main_14_017,"Hah! What's left to be ruined? I have nothing left."
CS_CH5_Main_14_018,"100 years ago, I lost my parents to the Demons. Now, my only sister was taken by my people."
CS_CH5_Main_14_019,"Every night, I can't even sleep because I fear seeing Epigael's undead form in my dreams."
CS_CH5_Main_14_020,"Revenge…is all I have left."
CS_CH5_Main_14_021,"So, how will you avenge yourself? Are you just killing every Dark Elf you see?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_022,"Hah, no."
CS_CH5_Main_14_023,"I will kill all soldiers that blindly follow the orders of the Crown. Those swine deserve to die."
CS_CH5_Main_14_024,"Did you feel any better killing them?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_025,"No. It's not enough, just slaughering worthless swine."
CS_CH5_Main_14_026,"My final goal is to destroy the Royal Crown. I thought you all could help me with that."
CS_CH5_Main_14_027,"We can't help you with that."
CS_CH5_Main_14_028,"If your goal was to save your people from the Darkness, we would give it our all."
CS_CH5_Main_14_029,"However, we cannot interfere with your country and its politics."
CS_CH5_Main_14_030,"I already told you."
CS_CH5_Main_14_031,"The Queen may not be of true royalty."
CS_CH5_Main_14_032,"That coward, Temorel, was probably tricked by her."
CS_CH5_Main_14_033,"So are you saying El-Rosed is possibly a Demon?"
CS_CH5_Main_14_034,"Well…we'll need to meet the Queen if we want to know about that,"
CS_CH5_Main_14_035,"You don't have a choice anyway. If you know about those Wards, there is no way she'll let you be."
CS_CH5_Main_15_001,"Hah, serves them right."
CS_CH5_Main_15_002,"That's what happens when you get corrupted and fool around."
CS_CH5_Main_15_003,"The Dark Elves from before said the Gnolls were allied with the Demons…"
CS_CH5_Main_15_004,"We can't trust them word for word."
CS_CH5_Main_15_005,"Dimael. Do you know anything about the Gnolls joining forces with the Demons?"
CS_CH5_Main_15_006,"That's news to me."
CS_CH5_Main_15_007,"I think…we should... talk with the Gnolls."
CS_CH5_Main_15_008,"Frey, I think the word you're searching for is 'interrogate' not 'talk'."
CS_CH5_Main_16_001,"If you answer us truthfully, we'll let you live."
CS_CH5_Main_16_002,"Please, please, good Master. I will speak nothing but the truth, don't hurt me."
CS_CH5_Main_16_003,"How did you Gnolls get powerful enough to rout the Dark Elves and take over?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_004,"Ah, ah, yes. That. A messenger of the Dark Lord came and gave us courage."
CS_CH5_Main_16_005,"A messenger..?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_006,"Don't lie, the Demon Lord hasn't even resurrected."
CS_CH5_Main_16_007,"Ah, ah...Then we probably misunderstood. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_008,"It may have not been the Demon Lord, but anyway it was still a Demon that encouraged us, yes!"
CS_CH5_Main_16_009,"What did the Demon say?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_010,"The Demon said the Dark Elves were weaker and that we could beat them in numbers."
CS_CH5_Main_16_011,"And when we went and fought, the Dark Elves weren't being sneaky anymore."
CS_CH5_Main_16_012,"Sneaky?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_013,"*Sigh*... The Dark-Elves were probably just being strategic."
CS_CH5_Main_16_014,"The Gnolls probably consider anything beyond frontal combat sneaky and underhanded."
CS_CH5_Main_16_015,"Anyway, we were thinking of conquering Arrovina by driving out the Dark Elves. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_016,"What did the Demon look like?"
CS_CH5_Main_16_017,"Ah, I haven't ever seen the Demon myself, I swear."
CS_CH5_Main_16_018,"I hope you aren't lying…"
CS_CH5_Main_16_019,"Please, good Master. I wouldn't lie to you. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_020,"Well, that seems to be it."
CS_CH5_Main_16_021,"Go. We won't hurt you."
CS_CH5_Main_16_022,"Don't ever cross paths with us again."
CS_CH5_Main_16_023,"Please, good Master. I wouldn't ever dare. It's just that…"
CS_CH5_Main_16_024,"the other Gnolls will probably still try to attack you…"
CS_CH5_Main_16_025,"I hope you understand that's not my fault!"
CS_CH5_Main_16_026,"Understood."
CS_CH5_Main_16_027,"Thank you for telling us the truth."
CS_CH5_Main_16_028,"Let's never meet again. "
CS_CH5_Main_16_029,"Yes, yes. I'll stay away, good Masters."
CS_CH5_Main_16_030,"Th..Then… Bye.."
CS_CH5_Main_16_031,"Take care."
CS_CH5_Main_17_001,"Typical Gnolls, weak to the strong and strong to the weak."
CS_CH5_Main_17_002,"I guess the Gnolls did side with the Demons, but it seems they haven't been given any powers."
CS_CH5_Main_17_003,"This is all so ridiculous."
CS_CH5_Main_17_004,"I can't stop myself from laughing…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_005,"El-Rosed…if she was trying to control people, she should learn how to do it right…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_006,"Dark-Elves… being pressured by simple, idiotic Gnolls…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_007,"Kkkk…Hahahaahaah!! Ugh, my sides…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_008,"Dimael…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_009,"I don't get it."
CS_CH5_Main_17_010,"The Queen, El-Rosed, who we don't yet know if she is a Demon or not, is using the power of darkness…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_011,"And the Gnolls are allied to the Demons.."
CS_CH5_Main_17_012,"But the Gnolls are attacking the Dark Elves…?"
CS_CH5_Main_17_013,"I wonder if the Demon Army is having a falling out."
CS_CH5_Main_17_014,"After all, Maria said she didn't like Malduk back In Ogria…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_015,"Maybe its like how it was in Ogria?"
CS_CH5_Main_17_016,"Malduk trying to control King Temorel… while Maria controls the Gnolls…"
CS_CH5_Main_17_017,"Hmm.. Dimael. Did Maria ask you anything personal?"
CS_CH5_Main_17_018,"Before she told me about what King Temorel had done,"
CS_CH5_Main_17_019,"she did ask me about my family."
CS_CH5_Main_17_020,"I see. It's highly likely then that Malduk is allied with El-Rosed."
CS_CH5_Main_17_021,"In the meanwhile, Maria is trying to interfere with that."
CS_CH5_Main_17_022,"Forget about the Gnolls…but Dimael, you are also being manipulated by Maria."
CS_CH5_Main_17_023,"It doesn't matter."
CS_CH5_Main_17_024,"All I want is my revenge."
CS_CH5_Main_18_001,"Hmm…Frey. "
CS_CH5_Main_18_002,"Yes?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_003,"You remember I analyzed the fragments of the Nucleus of Darkness, right?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_004,"I think I could neutralize the Wards after a quick analysis of them."
CS_CH5_Main_18_005,"Oh, Cleo. That would be wonderful!"
CS_CH5_Main_18_006,"Hmph, worthless. Don't bother."
CS_CH5_Main_18_007,"Those wards may be the only reason we're able to deal with the Dark Elves so easily."
CS_CH5_Main_18_008,"Neutralizing the Queen's control may make it harder to fight them. "
CS_CH5_Main_18_009,"Are you stupid? You said the Queen could be a Demon."
CS_CH5_Main_18_010,"In that case, wouldn't it be easier for us to wake everyone up and have them fight with us?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_011,"No, they are all just targets of my revenge. I have no intention of working with them."
CS_CH5_Main_18_012,"Dimael…"
CS_CH5_Main_18_013,"Have you ever faced your inner darkness in a dark place?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_014,"What are you talking about?"
CS_CH5_Main_18_015,"*Sigh*…so stubborn even without the help of that trap…"
CS_CH5_Main_18_016,"Dimael…he has been blinded by rage."
CS_CH5_Main_18_017,"All we can do is hope that Lua will bless his heart with the light of mercy…"
CS_CH5_Main_18_018,"Hah. Do you really think I would even accept such light."
CS_CH5_Main_18_019,"I have nothing left but revenge!! All I want is to kill those bastards!!"
CS_CH5_Main_18_020,"*Sigh*…it seems I've failed."
CS_CH5_Main_18_021,"I think I only fanned the flames of his hate…"
CS_CH5_Main_18_022,"Well.. Can't be helped. Let's just do what we can."
CS_CH5_Main_18_023,"First, let's break the Ward and gather the pieces."
CS_CH5_Main_19_001,"The Gnolls have passed the checkpoint. What were you all doing!?"
CS_CH5_Main_19_002,"I am sorry...We could not stop them, there were too many. "
CS_CH5_Main_19_003,"This must be the end for our race…"
CS_CH5_Main_19_004,"This is what we get for selling out our friends and families to the Demons..."
CS_CH5_Main_19_005,"Bascos.. That topic…"
CS_CH5_Main_19_006,"Do you really think that matters at this point?!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_007,"King Temorel is missing and there's nothing we can do about the attacking Gnolls."
CS_CH5_Main_19_008,"There is no way I can hold my head up high in front of the gravestones of our predecessors."
CS_CH5_Main_19_009,"Normally, you wouldn't be able to do that ever since you made a pact with the Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_19_010,"You are..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_011,"Dimael, returning from Aegina."
CS_CH5_Main_19_012,"The only family of Epigael, whom you doomed to the Demons!!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_013,"Epigael…"
CS_CH5_Main_19_014,"Sorry but I don't remember that name."
CS_CH5_Main_19_015,"There are too many we sacrificed…to remember every single person."
CS_CH5_Main_19_016,"Hmph, then die."
CS_CH5_Main_19_017,"Engrave her name upon your heart as you do so!!"
CS_CH5_Main_19_018,"Sorry, but I can't die yet, Dimael. Even as the end of our race draws near, "
CS_CH5_Main_19_019,"I will save my Queen.. El-Rosed!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_001,"So..this is the end…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_002,"My Queen… I have to protect you….till the end.."
CS_CH5_Main_20_003,"Quit spewing the name of some Queen whose origins aren't know."
CS_CH5_Main_20_004,"I need you to remember Epigael's name as you die!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_005,"I would much like to…sorry…."
CS_CH5_Main_20_006,"but I can only think of her Majesty's sad face…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_007,"Dammit, you've all been brainwashed!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_008,"The Queen is using the power of Darkness…she may even be a Demon…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_009,"and she brainwashed you all into blinded loyalty."
CS_CH5_Main_20_010,"She is not a Demon.."
CS_CH5_Main_20_011,"My Queen….is…..a…Dark-Elf…."
CS_CH5_Main_20_012,"Give it some thought. The royal bloodline, supposed to have died out…suddenly reappearing."
CS_CH5_Main_20_013,"Does that even make sense?!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_014,"Even if she is not of royal blood… It doesn't matter…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_015,"I can't imagine not living for her…trying to think otherwise makes my heart ache…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_016,"I wanted to..protect her..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_017,"And that is what is called brainwashing!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_018,"El-Rosed… My Queen…I couldn't keep you safe…I'm sorry…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_019,"Cmon, Bascos..."
CS_CH5_Main_20_020,"Get up. Wake up!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_021,"Stop searching for the fake queen,"
CS_CH5_Main_20_022,"get on your knees before me, and die as you apologize to Epigael!!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_023,"May Lua's blessing…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_024,"Shut up, Priest!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_025,"Don't pray for the dog who couldn't realise what reality was even beyond death!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_026,"Are you taking your frustration out on Frey?!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_027,"I'm fine, Cleo.. "
CS_CH5_Main_20_028,"It's all my fault..that I didn't understand Dimael's feelings…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_029,"Goddamnit, what an annoying woman."
CS_CH5_Main_20_030,"What!!?"
CS_CH5_Main_20_031,"Cleo…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_032,"...You have to thank Frey. If it wasn't for her, I'd have burned you to a crisp!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_033,"Yeah, thanks, Frey."
CS_CH5_Main_20_034,"I would have been burnt to death if it hadn't been for you…As if."
CS_CH5_Main_20_035,"I need to live….for now."
CS_CH5_Main_20_036,"Until I kill El-Rosed, who may as well be the last of the Royal Crown."
CS_CH5_Main_20_037,"And then, I will find Temorel….and…!!"
CS_CH5_Main_20_038,"Lua my goddess, please save the poor souls…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_039,"Allow your light of salvation to touch those who died without returning to their natural state of mind…"
CS_CH5_Main_20_040,"and Dimael, whose hatred and thirst for revenge has blinded him."
CS_CH5_Main_21_001,"Geh!! You people are!!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_002,"Kyakyakya! New meat!! I was tired of eating only Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_21_003,"You idiot! The people are very very powerful!!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_004,"Please, please, forgive us. I didn't know you would come this way…"
CS_CH5_Main_21_005,"We will leave! Right now!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_006,"No, you don't have to. We need your help, and it will be to your advantage as well."
CS_CH5_Main_21_007,"Do you see that Ward?"
CS_CH5_Main_21_008,"That makes the Dark Elves stronger. Break it and bring the pieces to us."
CS_CH5_Main_21_009,"Ah, yes, yes we will!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_010,"I will break them all and bring a whole bunch of them!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_011,"Roi! You can't take advantage of them like that!"
CS_CH5_Main_21_012,"Oops, I'm sorry. .."
CS_CH5_Main_21_013,"But…it's too late. "
CS_CH5_Main_22_001,"Hmm.. This Ward seems to be of higher quality magic compared to the Nucleus of Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_22_002,"Really?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_003,"Isn't it easier for the controller to just completely take over minds like back in Ellidora?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_004,"Complete control uses far more mana and is easier to reverse."
CS_CH5_Main_22_005,"As you know, Lorraine freed the Dryads from that in Ellidora."
CS_CH5_Main_22_006,"In this case, however…even Lorraine will have trouble breaking the spell."
CS_CH5_Main_22_007,"And why is that? "
CS_CH5_Main_22_008,"The Nucleus of the Darkness takes over one's spirit, but this Ward controls their emotions."
CS_CH5_Main_22_009,"In Ellidora, the corrupted people lost their minds completely,"
CS_CH5_Main_22_010,"but this is different."
CS_CH5_Main_22_011,"They are sane, but their controlled emotions force them into swearing fealty to their queen."
CS_CH5_Main_22_012,"So its easy to return people to sanity, but emotions are harder to sway…"
CS_CH5_Main_22_013,"Yes. Kasel. "
CS_CH5_Main_22_014,"So the cases I got emotional…"
CS_CH5_Main_22_015,"were the times that the Holy Sword started emitting darkness…are these related?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_016,"Dark emotions are hard to turn around."
CS_CH5_Main_22_017,"The pain only gets harder to deal with once their conscience steps in."
CS_CH5_Main_22_018,"Failing to deal with that pain will paralyze reasonable thought."
CS_CH5_Main_22_019,"Sieg… and Bascos…are cases of this, I think..."
CS_CH5_Main_22_020,"…I see."
CS_CH5_Main_22_021,"Himmullis and Balalaika were sane back in Ellidora,"
CS_CH5_Main_22_022,"so they weren't mind controlled at any rate."
CS_CH5_Main_22_023,"In the case of the Ward, though, there needs to be some kind of medium."
CS_CH5_Main_22_024,"A medium?"
CS_CH5_Main_22_025,"In the case of Sieg, his medium, or rather his darkest emotions, could be attributed to his inferiority complex."
CS_CH5_Main_22_026,"When we were trapped in Galluah, we were shown our dark sides…"
CS_CH5_Main_22_027,"Yes, that's true."
CS_CH5_Main_22_028,"In this case, however, we don't know what the Dark Elves are shackled with."
CS_CH5_Main_22_029,"This isn't based on magic, so it's beyond my specialty."
CS_CH5_Main_22_030,"Anyway, it means we need to meet the Queen,"
CS_CH5_Main_22_031,"and figure out what exactly became the medium for controlling the Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_22_032,"*Sigh*…The problem is, I don't think she'll give us a proper answer."
CS_CH5_Main_22_033,"We can't give up!"
CS_CH5_Main_22_034,"We should give it a try, and talk to the Queen first!"
CS_CH5_Main_22_035,"I find it most terrifying when Frey says we need to talk with the enemy."
CS_CH5_Main_23_001,"Are you the people that destroyed the Wards?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_002,"…Epigael..?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_003,"Wh..What?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_004,"Is..this a dream…?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_005,"Ah.. My brother.. You are alive..! "
CS_CH5_Main_23_006,"Is this real…? Is it really you, Epigael."
CS_CH5_Main_23_007,"My brother. I gave up my old name. My name now is El-Rosed."
CS_CH5_Main_23_009,"What happened to you… You became queen..?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_010,"First, come with me. I will tell you everything later."
CS_CH5_Main_23_011,"Let's get our revenge. Let's kill off every Dark Elf aside from ourselves…"
CS_CH5_Main_23_012,"What…are you talking about..?"
CS_CH5_Main_23_013,"It's all good now.... I met you, and that's all I needed. "
CS_CH5_Main_23_014,"I don't want you to stain your own hands with revenge. Let's leave this place…together."
CS_CH5_Main_23_016,"We should punish them for what they have done to us."
CS_CH5_Main_23_017,"Epigael.. I came all the way here to avenge your death."
CS_CH5_Main_23_018,"It wasn't as easy. There were many times when I just wanted to die."
CS_CH5_Main_23_019,"If you won't come with me, you must leave Arrovina."
CS_CH5_Main_23_020,"Otherwise, you will die too."
CS_CH5_Main_23_021,"Because all Dark Elves will die. "
CS_CH5_Main_23_022,"Epigael!!"
CS_CH5_Main_24_001,"He's…gone."
CS_CH5_Main_24_002,"….I don't even."
CS_CH5_Main_24_003,"Kekeh, good Masters."
CS_CH5_Main_24_004,"Eh? What is it?"
CS_CH5_Main_24_005,"You are all our heroes."
CS_CH5_Main_24_006,"Becoming heroes for Gnolls isnt quite pleasing. "
CS_CH5_Main_24_007,"So…we would like to repay you…"
CS_CH5_Main_24_008,"But since we don't have anything to give, we will introduce you to someone who can!"
CS_CH5_Main_24_009,"The Demons..?"
CS_CH5_Main_24_010,"So strong, and so smart, even!"
CS_CH5_Main_24_011,"Demons…this could be dangerous."
CS_CH5_Main_24_012,"Well, it may be better to give it a try."
CS_CH5_Main_24_013,"It could still be a trap, so be wary."
CS_CH5_Main_24_014,"Trap? No, no, nonono. No way, good Masters."
CS_CH5_Main_24_015,"I would never lie to you."
CS_CH5_Main_24_016,"She will be here soon, kekeke."
CS_CH5_Main_25_001,"You are..!!"
CS_CH5_Main_25_002,"Stupid Gnolls, ugh."
CS_CH5_Main_25_003,"Well, it doesn't matter."
CS_CH5_Main_25_004,"Let's see how much stronger you've become!"
CS_CH5_Main_26_001,"That wasn't bad. I enjoyed myself quite a bit."
CS_CH5_Main_26_002,"Were you using Dimael and Epigael??"
CS_CH5_Main_26_003,"Epigael? Ah, right. Dimael's sister."
CS_CH5_Main_26_004,"I see you've figured out quite a bit."
CS_CH5_Main_26_005,"What are you scheming, Morrah!"
CS_CH5_Main_26_006,"I see…those two have met."
CS_CH5_Main_26_007,"If you're that curious, we wouldn't mind a little session of information trading."
CS_CH5_Main_26_008,"Hmph, no need. It's not my problem."
CS_CH5_Main_26_009,"I'm done here."
CS_CH5_Main_27_001,"Do you think Morrah's goal was having those two meet?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_002,"Hm…I don't know what she would gain from that."
CS_CH5_Main_27_003,"I don't know either, but if the Demons know of their relationship and are trying to use that,"
CS_CH5_Main_27_004,"that wouldn't mean anything good for us. We should be careful."
CS_CH5_Main_27_005,"I think…we still need to meet and talk with them to understand the full picture."
CS_CH5_Main_27_006,"Cleo, are you ready?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_007,"Yeah. I was too startled a bit ago, but next time we meet, I'll be ready."
CS_CH5_Main_27_008,"What are you trying to do? "
CS_CH5_Main_27_009,"We'll try and save El-Rosed from the Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_27_010,"Wait, is that possible? "
CS_CH5_Main_27_011,"Well there are two problems yet to be solved…"
CS_CH5_Main_27_012,"One, we still don't know what the medium is."
CS_CH5_Main_27_013,"Isn't it revenge?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_014,"Well, for El-Rosed, yes. However, we're trying to reverse the power of the Wards."
CS_CH5_Main_27_015,"So we need to know the medium used for the Dark Elves."
CS_CH5_Main_27_016,"Hmm… I see."
CS_CH5_Main_27_017,"What is the other?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_018,"We can't guarantee her life."
CS_CH5_Main_27_019,"Yes…even in Ellidora,"
CS_CH5_Main_27_020,"we had to defeat the Dryads first for Lorrain to revert them back to their normal state."
CS_CH5_Main_27_021,"We don't know how strong El-Rosed is… but we may die if we underestimate her."
CS_CH5_Main_27_022,"Yes…so we can't guarantee anything."
CS_CH5_Main_27_023,"Even if we fight with all our power, we can't be sure about the safety of her, or even ourselves."
CS_CH5_Main_27_024,"Nothing to worry about, Frey."
CS_CH5_Main_27_025,"We have the holy sword!"
CS_CH5_Main_27_026,"Sure..but I hope we don’t come to a situation where we need it."
CS_CH5_Main_27_027,"I'm not too sure what will happen…if the power breaks out while I have yet to control it..."
CS_CH5_Main_27_028,"Especially considering we did travel with Dimael for a bit…"
CS_CH5_Main_27_029,"I would not want to kill his sister in front of him."
CS_CH5_Main_27_030,"Yeah..he may be a rude one, but that's too cruel."
CS_CH5_Main_27_031,"Cleo, if you can defeat El-Rosed's darkness,"
CS_CH5_Main_27_032,"can you stop the Darkness flowing into me from the Holy Sword as well?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_033,"Eh, what are you saying?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_034,"That's Frey's role! She'll be sad if you rely on me for that."
CS_CH5_Main_27_035,"Are you making excuses up because you can't?"
CS_CH5_Main_27_036,"Ugh, you idiot. The Holy Sword can't be analyzed by even the oldest of Druids!"
CS_CH5_Main_27_037,"You don't even know a bit about magic, and you accuse me of making excuses??"
CS_CH5_Main_27_038,"Haha, sorry. Well, it's just impressive that you found a way to turn El-Rosed back to normal."
CS_CH5_Main_27_039,"I am truly sorry, grand archmage."
CS_CH5_Main_27_040,"….I think I like it better when you fool around. Ew…"
CS_CH5_Main_27_041,"Hahah.. You two really are a good match."
CS_CH5_Main_27_042,"NO!!!!!!!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_001,"El Rosed…"
CS_CH5_Main_28_002,"You are… the people who were with my brother…"
CS_CH5_Main_28_003,"Did my brother leave?"
CS_CH5_Main_28_004,"We thought he was with you…"
CS_CH5_Main_28_005,"We were here together… He left me at the end. "
CS_CH5_Main_28_006,"This is all because of the Dark Elves…the ones who sacrificed me to the Demons…"
CS_CH5_Main_28_007,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry... my Queen."
CS_CH5_Main_28_008,"Cmon, all of you are just being brainwashed! She is trying to exterminate every single Dark Elf!!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_009,"My… my queen. We did realize things aren't as usual right now... Do they speak the truth? "
CS_CH5_Main_28_010,"...What would you say if they are?"
CS_CH5_Main_28_011,"No…you can't... My Queen.."
CS_CH5_Main_28_012,"If you believe so…kill me."
CS_CH5_Main_28_013,"I'm… sorry. My Queen… for our race, forgive me for having to kill you."
CS_CH5_Main_28_014,"Kugh… what is this pain deep in my heart.. I can't dare kill her.."
CS_CH5_Main_28_015,"Please..I'd rather die myself…!!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_016,"All the Dark Elves will die soon anyway. "
CS_CH5_Main_28_017,"Get rid of them. They've learned too much."
CS_CH5_Main_28_018,"You can all die if you need to. Build a mountain of dead bodies for my sake, and stop them."
CS_CH5_Main_28_019,"On your honor..!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_020,"Wake up! You know we have come to save you!"
CS_CH5_Main_28_021,"But I…even so..."
CS_CH5_Main_28_022,"we can't but help protect our Queen."
CS_CH5_Main_28_023,"We can't resist it. "
CS_CH5_Main_28_024,"Her sad face breaks our hearts…"
CS_CH5_Main_28_025,"We will keep her safe no matter what, our Queen... El-Rosed!"
CS_CH5_Main_29_001,"Please…spare the life of our Queen..Please..!"
CS_CH5_Main_29_002,"Why…why are you trying so hard, for a Queen that is trying to kill you all?"
CS_CH5_Main_29_003,"I…know that she is not of royalty…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_004,"I knew from the beginning….when she returned…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_005,"She was the one I had lead…to the demons…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_006,"I couldn't resist her from the beginning…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_007,"Guilt…deep, dark guilt washed all over me…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_008,"Then, I knew. Every one of our race, even those who have never seen her before, were all like me."
CS_CH5_Main_29_009,"Guilt was rooted deep in our hearts…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_010,"So.. please leave our poor Queen alone..let her go. "
CS_CH5_Main_29_011,"Guit…Remorse…"
CS_CH5_Main_29_012,"Cleo."
CS_CH5_Main_29_013,"Yes. The medium…was guilt."
CS_CH5_Main_29_014,"Everyone remembered the Dark Elves that had been killed by their own hands when they saw El-Rosed."
CS_CH5_Main_29_015,"That’s why they couldn't help but be loyal to her."
CS_CH5_Main_29_016,"It's exactly what that had controlled them."
CS_CH5_Main_29_017,"Now…we can save El-Rosed from the Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_29_018,"If she doesn't die, that is."
CS_CH5_Main_29_019,"Good  thing that Dimael isn't here."
CS_CH5_Main_30_001,"Worthless, all of you. They've made it this far…"
CS_CH5_Main_30_002,"Stop them, even if you all die!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_001,"Stop!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_002,"My brother, you have come back..!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_003,"You..you!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_004,"Hypocrites! You take pity on us for a second, and then try to harm Epigael!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_005,"We're just trying to save El-Rosed from the Darkness!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_006,"Free? Her? With your swords and blades?!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_007,"Uh…we have to defeat her first to…"
CS_CH5_Main_31_008,"Stop that, it's dangerous!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_009,"Epigael, come here."
CS_CH5_Main_31_010,"I can't agree with your goals, but I will definitely keep you safe from those who try to harm you!!"
CS_CH5_Main_31_011,"Dimael…we didn't want you to show up…"
CS_CH5_Main_31_012,"Forgive us. We can't let the Demons have their way here!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_001,"Now!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_002,"Good. Come on, Frey!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_003,"Yes!!"
CS_CH5_Main_32_004,"I remember the faces of those who kidnapped me…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_005,"Guilty, apologetic expresssions…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_006,"fear and anger had clouded my eyes…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_007,"Now…I see."
CS_CH5_Main_32_008,"Why now.."
CS_CH5_Main_32_009,"Even when they had always looked at me that way…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_010,"Epigael…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_011,"Epigael, open your eyes."
CS_CH5_Main_32_012,"Epigael: B..brother.."
CS_CH5_Main_32_013,"Epigael: What have I…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_014,"Dimael: It's fine Epi… We had no other choice…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_015,"Epigael: Yes... but they were suffering, too…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_016,"Epigael: Not only the king Timorel.."
CS_CH5_Main_32_017,"Epigael: Everyone were afraid of another tragedy…one like 100 years ago…"
CS_CH5_Main_32_018,"Epigael: I…felt the same."
CS_CH5_Main_32_019,"Dimael: That doesn't mean their sins disappeared."
CS_CH5_Main_32_020,"Epigael: And neither…have mine."
CS_CH5_Main_32_021,"Dimael: Yes.. My sins, as well."
CS_CH5_Main_32_022,"Epigael: Do you think we can forgive ourselves? Would we be able to forgive each other?"
CS_CH5_Main_32_023,"Dimael: We should try, Epi. We all have to try…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_001,"I'm sorry I spoil the mood, but do you intend to beg the Dark Elves for their forgiveness."
CS_CH5_Main_33_002,"Yes, we are."
CS_CH5_Main_33_003,"I disagree."
CS_CH5_Main_33_004,"Too many were lost."
CS_CH5_Main_33_005,"When they figure out El-Rosed was not of royal blood, who knows what may happen."
CS_CH5_Main_33_006,"What happened to King Timorel?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_007,"I…killed him."
CS_CH5_Main_33_008,"Nobody of the Royal family is left, and Arrovina is a mess."
CS_CH5_Main_33_009,"Meanwhile, the Gnolls are massacring your race."
CS_CH5_Main_33_010,"It's all my fault…I stopped them from fighting properly,"
CS_CH5_Main_33_011,"and let the Gnolls take over Arrovina."
CS_CH5_Main_33_012,"Then are you aware of Maria or Morrah?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_013,"I have never heard of them before."
CS_CH5_Main_33_014,"Then who corrupted you with the darkness?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_015,"When I was kidnapped, I was taken to a Black Knight."
CS_CH5_Main_33_016,"A large, deep Darkness pierced my very being…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_017,"I passed out as the Darkness ravaged my soul,"
CS_CH5_Main_33_018,"and when I came to…I was already a slave to the Darkness."
CS_CH5_Main_33_019,"A Black Knight…if he used the power of Darkness, it would be a Demon…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_020,"Actually…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_021,"He was neither Demon nor Human."
CS_CH5_Main_33_022,"He was ominous and frightening…but irresistable."
CS_CH5_Main_33_023,"…Some mixed breed of Human and Demon?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_024,"I've never heard of such beings."
CS_CH5_Main_33_025,"Did the Black Knight tell you to use Gnolls?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_026,"No, that was my idea."
CS_CH5_Main_33_027,"I thought if the current situation of Arrovina was known to the outside, it would bother 'His' plans…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_028,"so I thought this was the easiest way to get rid of my kind."
CS_CH5_Main_33_029,"So 'He' was the Black Knight..?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_030,"Yes."
CS_CH5_Main_33_031,"Hmm.. Then the 'He' Himmullis mentioned must also be the Black Knight."
CS_CH5_Main_33_032,"Is the 'He' Malduk spoke of also…?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_033,"Not sure. This 'He' thing is just a pronoun. We can't judge without context."
CS_CH5_Main_33_034,"Why was Morrah here, then?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_035,"Perhaps she is with the Black Knight. Or, she was trying to help with El-Rosed's plan."
CS_CH5_Main_33_036,"We can only make assumptions with what we have…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_037,"Were you headed to Aegina?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_038,"Yes. You said you were dispatched to Aegina before, Dimael?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_039,"I wouldn’t recommand the place. There is a reason I was almost killed."
CS_CH5_Main_33_040,"Aegina is overrun with Demons."
CS_CH5_Main_33_041,"Even more reason for us to go there."
CS_CH5_Main_33_042,"So…I guess your sword is Aea."
CS_CH5_Main_33_043,"How did you…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_044,"I will help you. I know Aegina better than most other people."
CS_CH5_Main_33_045,"However, give me some time…I want to spend some time with Epigael first."
CS_CH5_Main_33_046,"Hmph, don't bother. I don't care about you."
CS_CH5_Main_33_047,"I'm really sorry for being rude all this time. From now on, I will treat you properly as an archmage."
CS_CH5_Main_33_048,"Really..? Then…"
CS_CH5_Main_33_049,"Go ahead.."
CS_CH5_Main_33_050,"I will join you soon."
CS_CH5_Main_33_051,"What about Arrovina?"
CS_CH5_Main_33_052,"As long as nobody reveals the truth,"
CS_CH5_Main_33_053,"I am the Queen of Dark-Elves, El-Rosed. "
CS_CH5_Main_33_054,"With this position…I will try to fix what I have done."
CS_CH5_Main_33_055,"That's the best solution for now."
CS_CH5_Main_33_056,"I pray for Lua's blessing to be with the Kingdom of the Dark Elves, Arrovina."
CS_CH6_Main_0_001,"Finally, the Aegina Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_0_002,"The Barbarian kingdom was located within the Windland Snow Mountains, right?"
CS_CH6_Main_0_003,"The mountains are straight up north, but blocked off by a gigantic cliff."
CS_CH6_Main_0_004,"The only way to get there is through the Dragia Volcano."
CS_CH6_Main_0_005,"*Sigh*…Seems we still have quite the journey ahead of us."
CS_CH6_Main_0_006,"The Dragia Volcano should be west of our location."
CS_CH6_Main_0_007,"Dimael said Aegina was overrun by the Demons…"
CS_CH6_Main_0_008,"Lets be careful."
CS_CH6_Main_1_001,"Well, about those Demons running wild in Aegina..."
CS_CH6_Main_1_002,"I don't see any."
CS_CH6_Main_1_003,"I wonder if it's because we've just entered the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_1_004,"Perhaps the Demon Army moved somewhere else?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_005,"It's been a while since Dimael returned to Arrovina, after all."
CS_CH6_Main_1_006,"Let's be careful, just in case."
CS_CH6_Main_1_007,"….On that note, I sense an odd presence looking this way…"
CS_CH6_Main_1_008,"Who's there!!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_009,"Hey! Don't turn around!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_010,"...A girl?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_011,"*Sigh*…and things were just getting good…Still!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_012,"Even his face is so handsome~!!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_013,"But, but, the rear view was…wait, stay still for a second."
CS_CH6_Main_1_014,"On top of that, so cool~! What a great catch."
CS_CH6_Main_1_015,"Treating people like objects is rude, you know."
CS_CH6_Main_1_016,"Sorry, sorry~ I've been working as a mercenary for so long,\nI just kinda go ahead and evaluate people."
CS_CH6_Main_1_017,"A mercenary? Who hired you to come all this way to the Desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_018,"Umm…right now, I don't have any contracts. Want to hire me?"
CS_CH6_Main_1_019,"I'll give you a discount!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_020,"No."
CS_CH6_Main_1_021,"Hmm…will you be able to refuse after seeing my skills? C'mon, lets go. I'll show you!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_022,"No."
CS_CH6_Main_1_023,"Hehe, then go on ahead first. I'll just…enjoy myself a bit more. Hehe…"
CS_CH6_Main_1_024,"Heh, Roi...looks like you better let her hang around you rather than…you know!"
CS_CH6_Main_1_025,"*Sigh*…another weirdo."
CS_CH6_Main_2_001,"Hmm, only scorpions and Muhrooms…well, it'll have to do."
CS_CH6_Main_2_002,"Now, behold the skills of Reina, the Lightning Flash!"
CS_CH6_Main_3_001,"Your name was Reina, right? Your skills are quite impressive."
CS_CH6_Main_3_002,"Hehe, thanks for the compliment."
CS_CH6_Main_3_003,"Still, if anything…I would like to be complimented by this handsome gentleman~"
CS_CH6_Main_3_004,"Got a name, mister?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_005,"You might have figured already, but we don't need any mercenaries."
CS_CH6_Main_3_006,"While I acknowledge your skills,\nI feel no need to give my name to a stranger, as we will part ways soon."
CS_CH6_Main_3_007,"His name is Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_3_008,"*Sigh*...Cleo…"
CS_CH6_Main_3_009,"Fufu, no way I'm letting a girl so interested in Roi just leave like this."
CS_CH6_Main_3_010,"Hehe, so will you hire me?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_011,"Nope!"
CS_CH6_Main_3_012,"Eh?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_013,"As Roi said, we don't really need any mercenaries."
CS_CH6_Main_3_014,"If you don't have anything to do, let's travel together for a while\nWe'll provide the necessary provisions."
CS_CH6_Main_3_015,"Hmm…well, it is quite boring to travel alone."
CS_CH6_Main_3_016,"Still, just joining like that goes against my pride as a mercenary."
CS_CH6_Main_3_017,"Well then, take Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_3_018,"Who gave you the right!?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_019,"Hmm…well then, what about this?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_020,"I originally went to Orvelia to get a contract, but there were no good jobs."
CS_CH6_Main_3_021,"So I came all this way to Aegina because I heard someone else was hiring mercenaries."
CS_CH6_Main_3_022,"So you've visited Orvelia."
CS_CH6_Main_3_023,"Eh? Who are you? Since when were you there?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_024,"Uh…I was here all the time…"
CS_CH6_Main_3_025,"Ah, ok. Hi then."
CS_CH6_Main_3_026,"So, where are you all going?"
CS_CH6_Main_3_027,"We're headed towards the Dragia Volcano to find a way into the Windland Mountains."
CS_CH6_Main_3_028,"Well, we seem to be headed in the same direction."
CS_CH6_Main_3_029,"After all, my employer-to-be is supposed to be located somewhere\naround the West of the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_4_001,"Eh? Goblins and gnolls, together?"
CS_CH6_Main_4_002,"In the Desert, too…"
CS_CH6_Main_4_003,"Ack! Humans! Cough up, now!"
CS_CH6_Main_4_004,"Wow. Seriously. Goblins, threatening me, the Lightning Flash?"
CS_CH6_Main_4_005,"I'll make you regret this."
CS_CH6_Main_4_006,"If you won't cough up, we'll make you!"
CS_CH6_Main_4_007,"Hah, try it! You dared threaten an archmage. My flames will punish you all!"
CS_CH6_Main_4_008,"…Wow, there is actually someone in this world on the same wavelength as Cleo…"
CS_CH6_Main_5_001,"Kekeke,  I'm so sorry, so sorry, noble Masters..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_002,"Yeah, that's how things should be."
CS_CH6_Main_5_003,"You guys don't live here in the Desert. Why are you all here?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_004,"Us, Pirates!"
CS_CH6_Main_5_005,"Pirates? In the desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_006,"Ach? Pirates cannot in Desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_007,"You idiot!! Pirates are supposed to sail the Sea!!"
CS_CH6_Main_5_008,"But you're all in the Desert right now."
CS_CH6_Main_5_009,"Please, please, good Masters…we…kind of have our own issues…"
CS_CH6_Main_5_010,"We will go to the Sea eventually."
CS_CH6_Main_5_011,"We just need some money to do so…but then, you know…"
CS_CH6_Main_5_012,"So you're robbing people in the Desert in order to get a boat and be pirates?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_013,"By the name of Lua, if you don't stop…"
CS_CH6_Main_5_014,"Aaah! Please, please forgive us, dear Masters."
CS_CH6_Main_5_015,"We'll stop robbing people and go back home..."
CS_CH6_Main_5_016,"Ach, leave now, before they change mind!!"
CS_CH6_Main_5_017,"I dunno about the goblin…but wouldn't it be dangerous for the gnoll to return home?"
CS_CH6_Main_5_018,"I believe in giving everyone a chance."
CS_CH6_Main_5_019,"Of course…as long as it doesn't put us in danger."
CS_CH6_Main_6_001,"C'mon, hand over everything you have! Or should I just eat you, eh?!"
CS_CH6_Main_6_002,"Captain tell us steal, not eat!!"
CS_CH6_Main_6_003,"Dammit, you dumb goblin! Don't you know anything about threatening people?!"
CS_CH6_Main_6_004,"More robbers…"
CS_CH6_Main_6_005,"Ah! Please, help!! "
CS_CH6_Main_6_006,"Hahaha, what good luck! We'll make a killing today."
CS_CH6_Main_6_007,"Nope, you're really unlucky."
CS_CH6_Main_6_008,"Bullying such a cutie in front of me is worthy of punishment!!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_001,"Keke! Run! You, Captain won't forgive!!!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_002,"At this point, I'm just curious who's in charge of all these goblins and gnolls."
CS_CH6_Main_7_003,"Are you ok, cutie?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_004,"Thank you for saving me."
CS_CH6_Main_7_005,"Wow, your smile is so~~ cute. What's your name?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_006,"Ah…it's Adin."
CS_CH6_Main_7_007,"Ew…I thought she was only interested in Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_7_008,"What a flirt."
CS_CH6_Main_7_009,"I see~ Adin, it's dangerous to travel alone in the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_7_010,"Come with big sis~ I'll keep you safe day and night!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_011,"While I dunno about day, I can't really say the same for night."
CS_CH6_Main_7_012,"Why are you alone in this dangerous area?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_013,"Wow, Roi~ Are you putting your guard up because I'm showing interest in Adin?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_014,"You wish."
CS_CH6_Main_7_015,"Cool as always~ Well, that is your charm point!"
CS_CH6_Main_7_016,"So, anyway…what's little cutie Adin doing alone in the Desert?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_017,"I'm searching for the hidden treasure of the Aegina Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_7_018,"Treasure? What kind of treasure? Is it some kind of magical device?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_019,"Um..no, just stuff like gold."
CS_CH6_Main_7_020,"Eeh..what a disappointment."
CS_CH6_Main_7_021,"Eh? Well, as travelers, don't you need a lot of gold?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_022,"Like, you need it for all sorts of things, especially related to equipment…\nand it's good to be rich."
CS_CH6_Main_7_023,"Um..yeah, that's true, but I don't want to waste time looking for some hidden treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_7_024,"I mean, there are many other ways to make money, right?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_025,"So, any clue where this treasure is?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_026,"No, I haven't figured out the exact location yet…"
CS_CH6_Main_7_027,"Is that so? Well then, why don't we gather intel together?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_028,"Eh? Is that ok?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_029,"I agree."
CS_CH6_Main_7_030,"That's some quick decision making there, Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_7_031,"Hmm…I wonder if Roi prefers Reina sticking around Adin?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_032,"Roi, does interest from a woman other than Cleo make you uncomfortable?"
CS_CH6_Main_7_033,"*Sigh*…Frey, stop trying to couple me with Cleo."
CS_CH6_Main_7_034,"I'm just a bodyguard doing his job."
CS_CH6_Main_7_035,"Yeah, Frey. Stop trying to pair me with Roi."
CS_CH6_Main_8_001,"Are you the naughty children that bullied my boys?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_002,"Eh? Is that child the so-called Captain of those gnolls and goblins?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_003,"It appears to be so."
CS_CH6_Main_8_004,"I won't forgive you for raising your hand against the Miruru Pirates!"
CS_CH6_Main_8_005,"Eh? You're Miruru?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_006,"Dammit, there go my plans."
CS_CH6_Main_8_007,"Have you heard of Miruru from somewhere before?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_008,"Nah, it's just that the person hiring mercenaries was named Miruru."
CS_CH6_Main_8_009,"To think it was a pirate. And a child at that, too…"
CS_CH6_Main_8_010,"What? How could you not know the great Pirate Empress, Miruru!"
CS_CH6_Main_8_011,"Pirate Empress…?"
CS_CH6_Main_8_012,"Oh, come to think of it, I've heard about this before.\nThe Pirate Empress of the Seas, Miruru."
CS_CH6_Main_8_013,"She disappeared at some point…but I never knew she was a kid."
CS_CH6_Main_8_014,"Hmph, disrespectful brats. I'll stuff you full with my special cannonballs!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_001,"Huh, you all fight quite well!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_002,"OK, I'll accept you all as underlings!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_003,"Hah, I wouldn't join a pirate crew loitering around in the Desert if it was the last thing I did."
CS_CH6_Main_9_004,"Well, if it was lead by a big, tough and cool man I could have at least considered it..."
CS_CH6_Main_9_005,"Ahh ahh, I can't hear you, you're all my underlings now! That's final!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_006,"No."
CS_CH6_Main_9_007,"Nngh, I'll keep stalking you till you say OK!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_008,"*Sigh*…No sight of the Demon forces, and just a bunch of weirdos everywhere.."
CS_CH6_Main_9_009,"Well, we can't stop her if she says she'll follow us…"
CS_CH6_Main_9_010,"OK, Miruru. You can follow us, but you must stop robbing people."
CS_CH6_Main_9_011,"If you rob anyone else, we will be enemies again."
CS_CH6_Main_9_012,"Ok, ok. Now then! Let's go, my minions!!"
CS_CH6_Main_9_013,"We aren't your minions!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_001,"Kekeke, to think mere gnolls and goblins are invading our territory.."
CS_CH6_Main_10_002,"Kyak... damn…but...Captain forgive you not!!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_003,"Ca…captain!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_004,"Grr, you lizards…how dare you bully my underlings!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_005,"I, the Great Pirate Empress Miruru, will not forgive you!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_006,"Kekekeke, Pirate?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_007,"Hey, hey, did you hear? Pirates! In the Desert!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_008,"And the brat is the boss of Goblins and Gnolls! Gahahaha!!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_009,"What…these idiots…"
CS_CH6_Main_10_010,"No need to cry, Miruru. Pirates and robbers are evil,"
CS_CH6_Main_10_011,"but leading a number of different races isn't easy."
CS_CH6_Main_10_012,"You have accomplished that difficult task."
CS_CH6_Main_10_013,"Re..really?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_014,"Why can't I bring myself to believe she's really the Pirate Empress Miruru…"
CS_CH6_Main_10_015,"Th..thank you, Frey. I won't cry anymore."
CS_CH6_Main_10_016,"I swear this curse affected my psyche as well…I keep acting so childish."
CS_CH6_Main_10_017,"A curse?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_018,"Well, I found a treasure that grants eternal youth…"
CS_CH6_Main_10_019,"But it was cursed, and I turned into a kiddie!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_020,"Ki..kiddie??"
CS_CH6_Main_10_021,"Hehe, Frey~ Since I was cursed, you're the firstie to acknowledge me~"
CS_CH6_Main_10_022,"Huggies?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_023,"I…no…Dammit! Hey! Your minions were bullied by those lizards!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_024,"You need to avenge them!!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_025,"Ah! Right, right. Damn lizards, I'll introduce your faces to my cannonballs!"
CS_CH6_Main_10_026,"Phew... successful diversion."
CS_CH6_Main_10_027,"I'm envious, Frey. Aren't you popular?"
CS_CH6_Main_10_028,"Um..well, I don't know about being popular,\nbut it's good that we were able to help Miruru."
CS_CH6_Main_11_001,"Damn lizards! Taste my cannonballs, and remember the wrath of the Miruru Pirates!!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_002,"Hahaha, you can't win against the Power of Darkness we obtained!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_003,"Power of…Darkness?"
CS_CH6_Main_11_004,"So even the lizardmen…"
CS_CH6_Main_11_005,"Do they have a catalyst as well?"
CS_CH6_Main_11_006,"Well, they look sane…so that's probably likely."
CS_CH6_Main_11_007,"Perhaps there is another way to use the Darkness, a way we haven't learned of yet."
CS_CH6_Main_11_008,"Get them, my minions!!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_009,"Uh…uh?! But I can't fight!"
CS_CH6_Main_11_010,"Don't worry, cutie~ You don't have to listen to that brat."
CS_CH6_Main_11_011,"Little Adin only needs to listen to big sis~ hehe."
CS_CH6_Main_11_012,"Just stick behind my back~"
CS_CH6_Main_11_013,"Ah, ok…"
CS_CH6_Main_12_001,"Ah! There's a treasure chest over there!!"
CS_CH6_Main_12_002,"Adin, it's dangerous to run off alone!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_001,"He…help."
CS_CH6_Main_13_002,"Adin!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_003,"You dare lay your hands on my little cutie..!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_004,"Kekeke, so you're the Miruru Pirates."
CS_CH6_Main_13_005,"Yep, we're the Miruru Pirates!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_006,"No we aren't!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_007,"Heh, since the boss is a little girl, I suppose this little boy is her mate."
CS_CH6_Main_13_008,"Hey, I said Miruru isn't our boss!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_009,"Also, what kind of logic leads to that conclusion?!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_010,"He has nothing to do with Miruru either so let him go!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_011,"Ahahaha, of course you'd be mad after we kidnapped your comrade."
CS_CH6_Main_13_012,"Ugh, do those lizards only mate when both sides are similar in size…"
CS_CH6_Main_13_013,"Well, time to go, mate of Miruru. I'm sure you'll make a pretty sum as a slave."
CS_CH6_Main_13_014,"Wait!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_015,"Dammit, you runt! My little cutie got kidnapped because of you!!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_016,"Hmph, why is that my fault! He ran off on his own, even though he was a weakling!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_017,"Miruru! A companion was kidnapped."
CS_CH6_Main_13_018,"Yes, Adin shares responsibility for running into danger himself,\nbut you also played part in the misunderstanding."
CS_CH6_Main_13_019,"Fr…Frey~ I'm sowwy…don't be angwy…"
CS_CH6_Main_13_020,"Hey, you! Stop acting all cute when you're supposed to be a Pirate Empress!"
CS_CH6_Main_13_021,"This isn't the time for all this! We have to save my little cutie!"
CS_CH6_Main_14_001,"Damn it, they got away."
CS_CH6_Main_14_002,"Lizardmen in the slave trade…I didn't know they were like that."
CS_CH6_Main_14_003,"Yeah, I don't know about killing, but they sure aren't the type to take slaves."
CS_CH6_Main_14_004,"We can still catch up. Let's hurry."
CS_CH6_Main_15_001,"Adin!!"
CS_CH6_Main_15_002,"Aah, you came!"
CS_CH6_Main_15_003,"Tch, can't be helped."
CS_CH6_Main_15_004,"Give me back my little cutie!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_001,"Thank you for helping me."
CS_CH6_Main_16_002,"Are you hurt anywhere, cutie?"
CS_CH6_Main_16_003,"Ah, what a relief. Your cute face is fine."
CS_CH6_Main_16_004,"Yes, thanks to everyone, I'm fine."
CS_CH6_Main_16_005,"Ah, and I heard a few tidbits about the treasure from the lizardmen."
CS_CH6_Main_16_006,"Treaaasurreee~~??"
CS_CH6_Main_16_007,"Yes. Apparently the lizardmen are also searching for the treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_16_008,"I think I may have just figured this out."
CS_CH6_Main_16_009,"Let's go find the treasure!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_010,"Yeah! Let's go! Let's take this treasure and head out to the Sea!!!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_011,"Roi, do you know if the lizardmen have any interest in treasure?"
CS_CH6_Main_16_012,"No. While they aren't quite accepting of the other races,\nthey aren't known to be materialistic."
CS_CH6_Main_16_013,"Sometimes there are a few odd ones…but those roam solo."
CS_CH6_Main_16_014,"There have been no cases of groups of lizardmen\nsearching for treasure or money in the past."
CS_CH6_Main_16_015,"I wonder if they have some kind of reason?"
CS_CH6_Main_16_016,"Well, it's been a while since anyone came in contact with them…"
CS_CH6_Main_16_017,"so there may have been some changes to their lifestyle."
CS_CH6_Main_16_018,"What are you all doing? Let's go get that treasure!"
CS_CH6_Main_16_019,"On the other hand, they said the lizardmen have some ties with the Power of Darkness…"
CS_CH6_Main_16_020,"It seems we have reason to investigate, then."
CS_CH6_Main_17_001,"Hey, that’s…!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_002,"A dwarfish helmet!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_003,"Heave…ho!!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_004,"Miruru: Eh?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_005,"Dwarf: Who are you, and why do you interrupt my sandbath."
CS_CH6_Main_17_006,"Miruru: Why on earth are you sandbathing all the way up to your head?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_007,"Dwarf: It's common knowledge that dwarves are closely related to the earth."
CS_CH6_Main_17_008,"Dwarf: Obviously we'd sandbath every bit of our body."
CS_CH6_Main_17_009,"Why are you even wearing clothes if you're sandbathing? It's a given you should be naked!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_010,"Do you really wanna see a dwarf gramp's naked body…"
CS_CH6_Main_17_011,"Tut tut, Cleo...you just don't get the charm of a dwarf."
CS_CH6_Main_17_012,"A chubby little belly, with tight, strong muscles covering the entire body.\nAn experienced dwarf, even if he is old, is great!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_013,"*Sigh*…You…are really something."
CS_CH6_Main_17_014,"I was just resting for a bit after mopping up some Demons, and this happens…"
CS_CH6_Main_17_015,"Demons? We haven't seen a single Demon since we entered the Desert."
CS_CH6_Main_17_016,"Hahaha, well, I did do a through job!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_017,"From what I heard the Desert was overrun with them…"
CS_CH6_Main_17_018,"Well, that's true. Still, I was able to finish the job."
CS_CH6_Main_17_019,"After all, most of them were just lowly undead."
CS_CH6_Main_17_020,"That aside, what are you folk all doing in Aegina?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_021,"We're looking for the hidden treasure of the Desert!"
CS_CH6_Main_17_022,"You can just ignore that child, Master Dwarf."
CS_CH6_Main_17_023,"We're headed for the Barbarian Kingdom located in Windland."
CS_CH6_Main_17_024,"However, due to volcanic activity, we can't possibly cross through Dragia right now."
CS_CH6_Main_17_025,"Haha, I see. I too came from Dragia, but can't return due to the same reasons."
CS_CH6_Main_17_026,"Well, I've come to terms by taking a break, slaughtering demons in the meantime."
CS_CH6_Main_17_027,"Why don't we hunt down some more while we search for safe passage?"
CS_CH6_Main_17_028,"I'm sure we'll find one sooner or later."
CS_CH6_Main_18_001,"By my beard, is that the holy sword Aea?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_002,"Eh? How did you…"
CS_CH6_Main_18_003,"Wait... Aea? That Aea? The legendary holy sword?!"
CS_CH6_Main_18_004,"*Sigh*…again…"
CS_CH6_Main_18_005,"Well, if this isn't a joyful surprise."
CS_CH6_Main_18_006,"I fought alongside Kyle, who also wielded that sword."
CS_CH6_Main_18_007,"That means…you're the King of Dwarves, Phillop?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_008,"Hahaha, to think that the humans still remember my name."
CS_CH6_Main_18_009,"Wow~ The inheritor of the Holy Sword, and the King of Dwarves, all together."
CS_CH6_Main_18_010,"It is an honor to meet such great people."
CS_CH6_Main_18_011,"But what business does the King of Dwarves have in the Desert…?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_012,"Psh, King of Dwarves. I'm sick of that title, so stop that."
CS_CH6_Main_18_013,"Every time I try to leave the throne, I get re-elected."
CS_CH6_Main_18_014,"Lazy bums. They just don't want to deal with the responsibilities."
CS_CH6_Main_18_015,"Re-elected..?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_016,"From what I hear, the Dwarven Crown isn't inherited by royal bloodline,"
CS_CH6_Main_18_017,"but rather, they elect a King through a vote."
CS_CH6_Main_18_018,"That's a rather interesting concept."
CS_CH6_Main_18_019,"Ah, come to think of it. If you inherited the Sword, you too must be Ki…"
CS_CH6_Main_18_020,"Ah! I see some undead right over there. Phillop, are those the Demons you were hunting?"
CS_CH6_Main_18_021,"Hmm, yes. There were a few distractions, but since I'm all rested up - may the hunt resume!"
CS_CH6_Main_19_001,"Phillop."
CS_CH6_Main_19_002,"Ah, descendant of Kyle."
CS_CH6_Main_19_003,"I apologize for the inconvenience I may have caused you before.\nHahaha, I was just too happy to see you."
CS_CH6_Main_19_004,"You're hiding the truth about your lineage, correct?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_005,"Yes, that is true. Although I was also trying to hide the holy sword…"
CS_CH6_Main_19_006,"Haha..again, I apologize."
CS_CH6_Main_19_007,"I'm sure you have your reasons."
CS_CH6_Main_19_008,"Like any other position, the job of a king isn't an easy one,"
CS_CH6_Main_19_009,"and it just becomes harder when you try to do it properly."
CS_CH6_Main_19_010,"You're hiding your lineage because you have no wish to become king, correct?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_011,"For us humans,it is not right for one who is not king to even dream of the throne."
CS_CH6_Main_19_012,"Just the thought can turn one into a traitor, a rebel."
CS_CH6_Main_19_013,"As always, the humans and their squabbles over the crown stink of blood."
CS_CH6_Main_19_014,"Even in Kyle's time, many wished to kill him and take over the throne…\nand Kyle had to kill all of them."
CS_CH6_Main_19_015,"Is that true?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_016,"Haha, I guess his fame as a King of Heroes erased the bad reputation he once had."
CS_CH6_Main_19_017,"Good to see that his image as a cold blooded murderer\nstained with the blood of his half-brothers is gone."
CS_CH6_Main_19_018,"If only he didn't go missing,\nhe would have been able to spend the rest of his kingship happily and dutifully."
CS_CH6_Main_19_019,"Cold blooded…? Blood of his half-brothers…?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_020,"The Dwaves under my rule have long since had ties with Orvelia,\neven before the Demons invaded this world."
CS_CH6_Main_19_021,"Kyle was a good king, one who really worked hard for his subjects."
CS_CH6_Main_19_022,"However, nobody acknowledged his sacrifices.\nHis name only brought jeers and insults from the populace, that he killed his family to become king."
CS_CH6_Main_19_023,"It is regretful that it was so, considering the others had no interest\nin the responsibilities of the throne, but just its power."
CS_CH6_Main_19_024,"They even made the first move against Kyle, attempting to kill him…"
CS_CH6_Main_19_025,"I never knew…"
CS_CH6_Main_19_026,"Well, humans don't live for too long."
CS_CH6_Main_19_027,"I suppose the disastrous invasion of the Demons overwrote history in a good way."
CS_CH6_Main_19_028,"It's a tragedy that those forgotten issues are trying to take place again, though."
CS_CH6_Main_19_029,"That voice…"
CS_CH6_Main_19_030,"Reina?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_031,"Hmm..so you were royalty, huh."
CS_CH6_Main_19_032,"Since when were you listening?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_033,"From the beginning?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_034,"After all, Kasel, I followed you here."
CS_CH6_Main_19_035,"Ah, um…what do you need?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_036,"*Sigh* C'mon, no need to worry. I know what you're worried about."
CS_CH6_Main_19_037,"How to say this…Kasel, you're not really my type of guy. You're…kinda boring."
CS_CH6_Main_19_038,"Is…is that so."
CS_CH6_Main_19_039,"I just had something to say, that's all."
CS_CH6_Main_19_040,"You remember I said I went to Orvelia to get some contracts, but found no good jobs?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_041,"Ah, yes."
CS_CH6_Main_19_042,"Well, they tried to hire me to kill the successor to the holy sword."
CS_CH6_Main_19_043,"I mean, what kind of bad joke is that? Why would you hire a mercenary for a hit?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_044,"I swear the nobility of Orvelia swapped their common sense for cow manure."
CS_CH6_Main_19_045,"Anyway, I guess it was because the successor of the holy sword is also of royalty."
CS_CH6_Main_19_046,"The Orvelian nobilty…"
CS_CH6_Main_19_047,"I guess they knew the sword is inherited by royal blood."
CS_CH6_Main_19_048,"Hmph, not again…when will they ever learn."
CS_CH6_Main_19_049,"Huh, I thought you'd be more surprised? Even your reactions are dull."
CS_CH6_Main_19_050,"Well, I was…kind of expecting it."
CS_CH6_Main_19_051,"I heard a lot of things on the way."
CS_CH6_Main_19_052,"Reina, could you please pretend that you didn't hear anything today?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_053,"Hmm, well, ok. But could you let me grope Roi a bit in exchange?"
CS_CH6_Main_19_054,"Uh…I don't think I have the right…"
CS_CH6_Main_20_001,"Cleo, this is…"
CS_CH6_Main_20_002,"Yeah…That's definitely the Power of Darkness."
CS_CH6_Main_20_003,"Everyone, stop. Quiet…"
CS_CH6_Main_20_004,"Cleo. Are you sensing the Darkness from that gaudy gold-covered one?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_005,"I can't tell from this distance."
CS_CH6_Main_20_006,"For now, I think it's best we lay low and watch."
CS_CH6_Main_20_007,"Izakerr, I don't understand."
CS_CH6_Main_20_008,"Since when did we care for treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_20_009,"So…are you saying you don't like gold?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_010,"No, not that. But that's exactly what's weird."
CS_CH6_Main_20_011,"We never wanted for such things."
CS_CH6_Main_20_012,"We never wished for riches."
CS_CH6_Main_20_013,"But now, we're searching for treasure like our lives depend on it,\neven while sustaining losses."
CS_CH6_Main_20_014,"Now that I think of it, this is all really odd."
CS_CH6_Main_20_015,"Hmph, have you grown senile already?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_016,"I'll help jog your memory."
CS_CH6_Main_20_017,"Behold all this gold! Bask in its brilliance, its radiance and glory!"
CS_CH6_Main_20_018,"The Power of Darkness…it's growing stronger."
CS_CH6_Main_20_019,"How...how beautiful."
CS_CH6_Main_20_020,"Ah, I think I may grow blind. I want it. I want the shinies…"
CS_CH6_Main_20_021,"I guess Greed is the catalyst for the lizardmen."
CS_CH6_Main_20_022,"Everyone has a desire to own what they wish for,"
CS_CH6_Main_20_023,"but greed beyond one's capabilities will only ruin people and those around them…"
CS_CH6_Main_20_024,"Now, what do you think. Don't you want to go search for more treasure?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_025,"Yes! I want more! I also want to cover myself in gold like you!"
CS_CH6_Main_20_026,"Go forth! We shall erect our own empire of gold!"
CS_CH6_Main_20_027,"Now that we know what the catalyst is, there is no need to stay in hiding."
CS_CH6_Main_20_028,"Cleo, can we save those lizardmen from the Darkness?"
CS_CH6_Main_20_029,"Piece of cake. Well, we only have to beat up that one called Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_20_030,"Good. Let's go."
CS_CH6_Main_21_001,"Who are you."
CS_CH6_Main_21_002,"Corrupting your own peaceful race with darkness and greed,"
CS_CH6_Main_21_003,"how could you call yourself a leader of your race like that?"
CS_CH6_Main_21_004,"You misunderstand. We originally had no leader. Everyone lived their own way."
CS_CH6_Main_21_005,"I too lived my own life, far away from my race."
CS_CH6_Main_21_006,"I dreamt of a better life beyond the horizon,"
CS_CH6_Main_21_007,"unlike my brothers who lived drearily with no aspirations at all."
CS_CH6_Main_21_008,"So…that great dream was nothing more than a measly treasure hunt?"
CS_CH6_Main_21_009,"You too seem to be fools stuck in the present."
CS_CH6_Main_21_010,"How sad, to think even the humans were afflicted with such sloth."
CS_CH6_Main_21_011,"I have no time for the likes of you. I must go find my treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_21_012,"….."
CS_CH6_Main_21_013,"Wait, that's just running away!"
CS_CH6_Main_21_014,"Well, I can understand his feelings, and the call of treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_21_015,"Poor Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_21_016,"Hm? Why would you say that…"
CS_CH6_Main_21_017,"Well, he's probably like me, and found some kind of cursed treasure in the past."
CS_CH6_Main_21_018,"Dreaming of a better life…beyond the horizon?"
CS_CH6_Main_21_019,"I swear he has been cursed with the power of cheesiness."
CS_CH6_Main_21_020,"Ah, I'm so sad. Frey, cheer me up, please? Huggies~"
CS_CH6_Main_21_021,"…I swear you're the cheesy one here."
CS_CH6_Main_22_001,"Cleo, can you save Izakerr too?"
CS_CH6_Main_22_002,"*Sigh*…Frey, there's no need to take guys like that into consideration."
CS_CH6_Main_22_003,"It would be easier to just take him out."
CS_CH6_Main_22_004,"But…even Miruru said she felt bad for him…"
CS_CH6_Main_22_005,"Grr, don't take everything she says so seriously!"
CS_CH6_Main_22_006,"But Cleo…even so, I want to give Izakerr a chance."
CS_CH6_Main_22_007,"*Sigh*…all right, all right. If you say so, Frey."
CS_CH6_Main_22_008,"Let's give it a try. We've succeeded once before, after all."
CS_CH6_Main_23_001,"You…!!"
CS_CH6_Main_23_002,"Hmph, I see. Even though you said otherwise,\nI see you too were interested in the treasure here."
CS_CH6_Main_23_003,"No, we just had business with you personally, Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_23_004,"I have no idea how you learned how to control the Power of Darkness,"
CS_CH6_Main_23_005,"but that power will eventually lead you and your race to ruin."
CS_CH6_Main_23_006,"Hmph, I won't be fooled."
CS_CH6_Main_23_007,"This power is exactly what I need to unify my race!"
CS_CH6_Main_23_008,"No way we're talking our way through this one."
CS_CH6_Main_23_009,"I won't let anyone else take it! The treasure of Aegina is mine!!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_001,"Just a moment, Izakerr."
CS_CH6_Main_24_002,"We'll save you from the Darkness now."
CS_CH6_Main_24_003,"Hmph, I refuse. Hahaha..I have no regrets."
CS_CH6_Main_24_004,"I want to die living my life, just like this."
CS_CH6_Main_24_005,"If that is your last wish…rest in peace."
CS_CH6_Main_24_006,"Hmm? Wait, I don't see Adin."
CS_CH6_Main_24_007,"Adin? Where are you, cutie~?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_008,"Isn't this bad? He may have been hurt by those lizardmen!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_009,"I saw him sneaking off while we were dealing with the lizardmen."
CS_CH6_Main_24_010,"From his expression, I'm pretty sure he was filled with hope of finding the treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_24_011,"What? You let that helpless child just wander off?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_012,"That's low, even if you were jealous of him."
CS_CH6_Main_24_013,"You wish."
CS_CH6_Main_24_014,"Regardless, everything will be fine.\nAfter Izakerr died, I'm sure all the lizardmen were freed from the Power of Darkness."
CS_CH6_Main_24_015,"Adin won't be in any trouble."
CS_CH6_Main_24_016,"Hmm…ok. Well, what are your future plans now?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_017,"Eh, I'll stick around Aegina for a bit longer, cleaning up any leftover Demons."
CS_CH6_Main_24_018,"Roi?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_019,"None of your business."
CS_CH6_Main_24_020,"We'll continue looking for a way to the Windland Mountains."
CS_CH6_Main_24_021,"Hmm…what do I do…"
CS_CH6_Main_24_022,"I do want to follow Roi, and I don't mind following Phillop either…"
CS_CH6_Main_24_023,"Ah! Well, Adin may still get in other kinds of trouble,\nso it will be best if I go and be his bodyguard!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_024,"That's a good idea."
CS_CH6_Main_24_025,"Haha, Reina isn't even mentioning me as usual…I feel a bit left out."
CS_CH6_Main_24_026,"Well, Kasel, you have Selene."
CS_CH6_Main_24_027,"That's only because of the Holy Sword."
CS_CH6_Main_24_028,"Well…not like I was ever popular or anything."
CS_CH6_Main_24_029,"Frey, I'm gonna go find the treasure."
CS_CH6_Main_24_030,"After that, I'll become a truly great pirate, and come to get you."
CS_CH6_Main_24_031,"Let's go out to the Sea together!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_032,"No! Frey has her own path to follow."
CS_CH6_Main_24_033,"Go to the Sea on your own!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_034,"You know, you keep trying to get between me and Frey,\nand it's honestly starting to tick me off."
CS_CH6_Main_24_035,"I was part of this party before you even showed up!"
CS_CH6_Main_24_036,"See, Kasel. Taking Frey's current predicament into consideration,"
CS_CH6_Main_24_037,"don't you think it could be better to be unpopular?"
CS_CH6_Main_24_038,"That suuuuure makes me feel a lot better."
CS_CH6_Main_24_039,"Anyway, we really should go find a road towards the Windland Mountains."
CS_CH6_Main_25_001,"Huh, there's a path here…"
CS_CH6_Main_25_002,"Did anyone know that this path existed?"
CS_CH6_Main_25_003,"Yes, I remember that in the past,\nthere was a path from Aegina that lead towards Windland,"
CS_CH6_Main_25_004,"but after the Dark Lord disappeared, it was sealed off."
CS_CH6_Main_25_005,"I wonder if the reappearance of the Demons has anything to do\nwith the seal being undone."
CS_CH6_Main_25_006,"That might be the case."
CS_CH6_Main_25_007,"It may be dangerous…but this is probably our only way through."
CS_CH6_Main_25_008,"Don't worry, Kasel. We've been through a lot of dangerous situations already."
CS_CH6_Main_25_009,"Yeah, everywhere that's not home is dangerous, anyway."
CS_CH6_Main_25_010,"Haha, well, that's true. Still, we're finally near Windland, and the Barbarian Kingdom."
CS_CH6_Main_25_011,"I hope our journey ends soon so we could go home and sleep under a nice roof."
CS_CH6_Main_25_012,"Great! C'mon, lets get to that Kingdom already."
CS_CH6_Main_25_013,"Finally, Arlette…"
CS_CH6_Main_25_014,"Your child has come back."
CH6_Sub_1_001,"As expected, the Desert has scorpions…"
CH6_Sub_1_002,"Careful, Kasel. Scorpions are rather dangerous."
CH6_Sub_1_003,"Those huge pincers are rather impressive."
CH6_Sub_1_004,"True…Mmm."
CH6_Sub_1_005,"Roi, I think Kasel is impressed by those pincers in a different way..."
CH6_Sub_1_006,"Yeah, I could tell once he started making that noise."
CH6_Sub_1_007,"The pincers are tastiest when it comes to these."
CH6_Sub_1_008,"Let's go!"
CH6_Sub_1_009,"Don't get too excited, Kasel! You'll get hurt."
CH6_Sub_2_001,"What heat. Can we really pass through Dragia?"
CH6_Sub_2_002,"Urgh, it's quite different from what it was like before…"
CH6_Sub_2_003,"Cleo, have you been to Dragia before?"
CH6_Sub_2_004,"Yeah, the first place I went to after I left the Tower was Dragia."
CH6_Sub_2_005,"I came here looking for clues about my mom…"
CH6_Sub_2_006,"Were there none?"
CH6_Sub_2_007,"Yeah…that's why I went to Orvelia."
CH6_Sub_2_008,"Were you planning on crossing through Dragia?"
CH6_Sub_2_009,"It's impossible. The volcano became active recently, it's too dangerous."
CH6_Sub_2_010,"*Sigh*...What now?"
CH6_Sub_2_011,"What now? What do you mean, what now?\nYou should help think of a way to go out to the Sea with me!"
CH6_Sub_2_012,"*Sigh*…We need to get to Windland. We have no time for your games."
CH6_Sub_2_013,"Well, we still have to figure out the relationship between the lizardmen and the Darkness."
CH6_Sub_2_014,"In the meantime, hopefully we might find a different road -\nor the volcano may go dormant."
CH7_Main_0_001,"Everything is ruined because of you. If it wasn't for you...Kyle would have never turned out that way!!"
CH7_Main_0_002,"Yes...It's all my fault...I guess...I must die..."
CH7_Main_0_003,"We elves will not judge whether a single human must die or not."
CH7_Main_0_004,"However, your baby must live."
CH7_Main_0_005,"Lorraine, that woman has lost everything."
CH7_Main_0_006,"It would not be surprising if she hated even her child at this very moment."
CH7_Main_0_007,"Come. A good night's sleep will make everything better. That should be enough."
CH7_Main_0_008,"We may need the help of that child one day, as well."
CH7_Main_0_009,"Will II stop hating you once I wake up..."
CH7_Main_0_010,"I can't help you live in luxury,"
CH7_Main_0_011,"but I can lay my life down for you."
CH7_Main_0_012,"That is the one thing no noble or king can do for you."
CH7_Main_1_001,"That's...a tiger. A pretty big one, too."
CH7_Main_1_002,"Kasel, you were thinking you could eat your full for once if we caught that, right?"
CH7_Main_1_003,"Ahaha...Frey, you know me too well."
CH7_Main_1_004,"Well, it seems the tiger is pretty hungry too."
CH7_Main_1_005,"One wrong move and we could be the ones to become food."
CH7_Main_1_006,"Hah, don't worry! One special archmage barbecue coming right up."
CH7_Main_2_001,"Hey, you! Why are you interfering with my hunt!"
CH7_Main_2_002,"Eh? Do you mean us?"
CH7_Main_2_003,"Yeah! That tiger was mine!"
CH7_Main_2_004,"What?! Didn't you see us catching that tiger?"
CH7_Main_2_005,"The tiger was moving too much because of you, so I couldn't take the shot."
CH7_Main_2_006,"Ugh...Kasel, say something."
CH7_Main_2_007,"Hmm...Cleo, let's give the tiger to her."
CH7_Main_2_008,"Eh? Kasel, are you really giving up on food?"
CH7_Main_2_009,"Well, if she had her sights on it first, it can't be helped."
CH7_Main_2_010,"Wait, what about our efforts in catching it?"
CH7_Main_2_011,"Cleo, we would have had to fight that tiger anyhow if we were to pass through this road."
CH7_Main_2_012,"Wow, you're all so nice. I'm Rodina, pleased to meet you. Well then, I'll be taking the tiger!"
CH7_Main_2_013,"Just a second, Rodina. Do you know where the Barbarian Kingdom is?"
CH7_Main_2_014,"Eh? Oh, that kingdom is no more. Anyway, thanks!"
CH7_Main_2_015,"Eh? Wa...wait!"
CH7_Main_2_016,"Ah...well, there she goes. Dammit."
CH7_Main_2_017,"We lost our tiger and the Barbarian Kingdom is gone..."
CH7_Main_2_018,"Let's try to find some remaining Barbarians, then."
CH7_Main_3_001,"That...looks like a Barbarian, right?"
CH7_Main_3_002,"Why is he fighting with the harpies?"
CH7_Main_3_003,"Let's go and ask."
CH7_Main_3_004,"Humans...hmph, no doubt you're here to help the Barbarians, as kindred primates!"
CH7_Main_3_005,"Eh?"
CH7_Main_3_006,"Disappear!!"
CH7_Main_3_007,"Wait, we wanted to talk..."
CH7_Main_3_008,"I don't think that's likely."
CH7_Main_3_009,"They're attacking!"
CH7_Main_4_001,"Ah...sorry, sorry. I got you caught up in my little scuffle."
CH7_Main_4_002,"It's fine. We were looking for a Barbarian, after all."
CH7_Main_4_003,"What for?"
CH7_Main_4_004,"We heard that...the Barbarian Kingdom has fallen."
CH7_Main_4_005,"Do you know what happened?"
CH7_Main_4_006,"I wasn't here when that happened, so i don't know the details."
CH7_Main_4_007,"However, apparently every other race on Windland is now hostile to the Barbarians."
CH7_Main_4_008,"I hear they all bonded together to overthrow the Barbarian Kingdom."
CH7_Main_4_009,"So that's why the harpies..."
CH7_Main_4_010,"Weren't the Barbarians originally warring against the Frost Giants?"
CH7_Main_4_011,"Yeah. The Frost Giants were the first to attack, too."
CH7_Main_4_012,"I have no idea why the other races took their side..."
CH7_Main_4_013,"The war didn't make any sense to begin with."
CH7_Main_4_014,"King Musuclow, the Barbarian King at the time of the Demon Invasion,"
CH7_Main_4_015,"and the Tarkas, the Frost Giant King, worked together to defeat the Demons."
CH7_Main_4_016,"If the legends are true, they were very good friends."
CH7_Main_4_017,"While 100 years have passed, even now"
CH7_Main_4_018,"nobody knows why Tarkas and King Musuclow came to conflict."
CH7_Main_4_019,"Even so, it wasn't as if they actually fought back then; they merely stopped communicating with each other."
CH7_Main_4_020,"Yes, I heard Tarkas only started attacking the Barbarian Kingdom after King Musuclow passed away."
CH7_Main_4_021,"Hmm, considering Frost Giants have a lifespan that is about 10 times longer than the average human...Tarkas must still be alive."
CH7_Main_4_022,"Was he trying to honor his late friend till the last moment?"
CH7_Main_4_023,"What use is all that?!"
CH7_Main_4_024,"In the end, our Kingdom was destroyed by his hand."
CH7_Main_4_025,"My entire race has been reduced to living in hiding, scattered across Windland."
CH7_Main_4_026,"Now those harpies...they are hunting down every single straggler merely trying to live in hiding."
CH7_Main_4_027,"Why are they doing such a thing..."
CH7_Main_4_028,"I want to know too. So much has happened while I was away from the Kingdom."
CH7_Main_4_029,"Although the others...they refuse to meet with me."
CH7_Main_4_030,"Can't blame them. From their point of view, I ditched all my responsibilities and ran away."
CH7_Main_4_031,"So, for now we have no leads on the whereabouts of the last Barbarian King..."
CH7_Main_4_032,"Well, it can't hurt to try. I'll help."
CH7_Main_5_001,"*Sigh*...things just became very complicated."
CH7_Main_5_002,"I was hoping that the Barbarian Kingdom was the key"
CH7_Main_5_003,"to us finding out how to recover the rest of the Holy Sword's power."
CH7_Main_5_004,"....Kasel."
CH7_Main_5_005,"What do you plan to do...after you find out how to recover its power?"
CH7_Main_5_006,"I remember you said you would hold on to the Sword for the time being."
CH7_Main_5_007,"You didn't recover the Sword's Power back in Ogria."
CH7_Main_5_008,"I am not...thinking about the future, just yet."
CH7_Main_5_009,"For now, I'm just doing what I can."
CH7_Main_5_010,"I do hope some of the Barbarian royalty survived the war."
CH7_Main_5_011,"Yes. I don't know about the area above the cliffs, but down here, there isn't too much ground to cover."
CH7_Main_5_012,"As long as I know someone is targeting my life..."
CH7_Main_5_013,"I can't return to the life I had before I received the Holy Sword."
CH7_Main_6_001,"Wow! Dryads, even in all this snow!"
CH7_Main_6_002,"I guess the Dryads here haven't been corrupted?"
CH7_Main_6_003,"They haven't been corrupted, but..."
CH7_Main_6_004,"Humans?"
CH7_Main_6_005,"While they aren't Barbarians, they are still of humankind!"
CH7_Main_6_006,"*Sigh*...as I was trying to say,"
CH7_Main_6_007,"every race here has become hostile to humankind as a whole."
CH7_Main_6_008,"What, even the nice and gentle Dryads have become your enemy?"
CH7_Main_6_009,"The heck were you Barbarians doing here?"
CH7_Main_6_010,"Cleo, Gau wasn't here while this all happened."
CH7_Main_6_011,"Yeah, I think we should at least know why we are being attacked."
CH7_Main_6_012,"Dryads, could you please tell us why you are hostile towards humanity?"
CH7_Main_6_013,"Do you really not know."
CH7_Main_6_014,"100 years ago, humanity was the race that brought the Demons to this world"
CH7_Main_6_015,"And now, they have allied themselves with Demons once again. Humans are a blight upon this world."
CH7_Main_6_016,"...Wha...what...."
CH7_Main_6_017,"No. No....that can't be true."
CH7_Main_6_018,"Disappear!!"
CH7_Main_7_001,"Aah, damnit! This is all so unfair!"
CH7_Main_7_002,"The harpies, the orcs, the dark elves - they made deals with the Demons, not us!"
CH7_Main_7_003,"It's not just the Barbarians that worked with Demons!"
CH7_Main_7_004,"Who the hell would work with Demons?!"
CH7_Main_7_005,"Come on, that's the only explanation for this."
CH7_Main_7_006,"The only humans that live in Windland are you Barbarians,"
CH7_Main_7_007,"so if every other race turned on you, wouldn't that be why?"
CH7_Main_7_008,"We don't know anything for sure, yet."
CH7_Main_7_009,"For all we know, this could be a plot to destroy the Barbarians!"
CH7_Main_7_010,"He's right, Cleo. There's not enough information yet."
CH7_Main_7_011,"We need to investigate a bit further."
CH7_Main_7_012,"*Sigh*...You're right. I was just annoyed because we were attacked for no reason."
CH7_Main_7_013,"Yeah, considering what we went through to get here...it is a bit unfair."
CH7_Main_7_014,"Well, it's true that the rumors say a human opened the Dimension Gate."
CH7_Main_7_015,"Well, at this point I don't really think that was an accident anymore..."
CH7_Main_8_001,"Frost Giants!!"
CH7_Main_8_002,"Oh, that man is....Gau!?"
CH7_Main_8_003,"We thought you were dead, since you never showed your face!"
CH7_Main_8_004,"You don't seem to know each other..."
CH7_Main_8_005,"Considering they know who you are, I guess you were quite famous, eh?"
CH7_Main_8_006,"Stories of the past. My homeland has perished, so what use is there in past glory."
CH7_Main_8_007,"He's a dangerous one. Kill him at all costs!!"
CH7_Main_9_001,"Oh, isn't that Rodina?"
CH7_Main_9_002,"Ah! Hello~. Nice to see some friendly faces. Would you help me for a bit?"
CH7_Main_9_003,"What's going on?"
CH7_Main_9_004,"There are some Frost Giants trying to attack my residence."
CH7_Main_9_005,"I would like to discuss the specifics after we get rid of them..."
CH7_Main_10_001,"Thank you, thank you."
CH7_Main_10_002,"Do you live around here?"
CH7_Main_10_003,"Yes, I do,"
CH7_Main_10_004,"Is that so... Could we borrow your place for one night? As thanks?"
CH7_Main_10_005,"Mmm...is anyone of you named Kasel, by the way?"
CH7_Main_10_006,"I'm Kasel. How did you know my name...?"
CH7_Main_10_007,"Ah, so it was you people."
CH7_Main_10_008,"Let us go. There is someone waiting for you."
CH7_Main_11_001,"This is..."
CH7_Main_11_002,"Is this the Sealed Ice Cavern?"
CH7_Main_11_003,"Yes, it is."
CH7_Main_11_004,"You live here?"
CH7_Main_11_005,"For now, yes."
CH7_Main_11_006,"I heard this place was sealed with magic for over a thousand years."
CH7_Main_11_007,"That seal was broken?!"
CH7_Main_11_008,"That's just how it was known. People have been coming and going around here for some time now."
CH7_Main_11_009,"How are you so calm about this! This place is supposed to be a big deal between sorcerers!!"
CH7_Main_11_010,"It was sealed by magic, and you're not even a spellcaster!"
CH7_Main_11_011,"I never said I was the Master of this cavern."
CH7_Main_11_012,"Wait, you did say someone was waiting for us..."
CH7_Main_11_013,"Is that person..."
CH7_Main_11_014,"Yes, he's the one. Let us go."
CH7_Main_12_001,"*Sigh*...not again."
CH7_Main_12_002,"Wa..wait. This is different from the rumors!"
CH7_Main_12_003,"Why are there demons here?!"
CH7_Main_12_004,"Well, rumors are rumors, and quite a number of frozen bodies were just left behind over time."
CH7_Main_12_005,"Simply, they turned into undead."
CH7_Main_12_006,"We couldn't stop the power of darkness from invading these caverns."
CH7_Main_12_007,"Demons, even in these lands...what the hell happened here?"
CH7_Main_12_008,"Eh? You're a Barbarian, and you don't even know about that?"
CH7_Main_12_009,"Your King made a deal with the Demon, Malduk."
CH7_Main_12_010,"Wh...what? Don't lie to me!"
CH7_Main_12_011,"I wouldn't lie. It's my mission keep a look out for all that happens around these lands."
CH7_Main_12_012,"I know everything that happened recently, at least."
CH7_Main_12_013,"That...there's no way..."
CH7_Main_12_014,"...Could you explain in more detail."
CH7_Main_12_015,"Well, it can wait."
CH7_Main_12_016,"We should probably bury those corpses first."
CH7_Main_13_001,"Are you ready to listen?"
CH7_Main_13_002,"....Yes."
CH7_Main_13_003,"How long has it been since you left your Kingdom?"
CH7_Main_13_004,"About...10 years."
CH7_Main_13_005,"It's no surprise you didn't know what was going on, then."
CH7_Main_13_006,"When I received my mission and was dispatched to this area,"
CH7_Main_13_007,"which was about 3 years ago...the Barbarian Kingdom was already in shambles."
CH7_Main_13_008,"The long war caused many Barbarian refugees to wander around,"
CH7_Main_13_009,"and considering their rough, brutal nature, they survived by plundering Harpies and Dryads."
CH7_Main_13_010,"So that's why...everyone turned against us."
CH7_Main_13_011,"Not really. Those who joined in the war against humanity were not that numerous."
CH7_Main_13_012,"Still, even those small numbers made a difference."
CH7_Main_13_013,"In the end, the Barbarian Kingdom was on the brink of Ruin."
CH7_Main_13_014,"That was when Malduk visited the Barbarian King."
CH7_Main_13_015,"*Sigh*...Malduk, that name gives me the headaches now."
CH7_Main_13_016,"The rest is simple as day, I guess."
CH7_Main_13_017,"Cleo, don't be so blunt in front of Gau."
CH7_Main_13_018,"It's fine..."
CH7_Main_13_019,"So thats how the Undead came to be in Windland..."
CH7_Main_13_020,"Yes, that was the Barbarian King's worst decision."
CH7_Main_13_021,"It's obvious."
CH7_Main_13_022,"Everyone would most definitely turn against the Barbarians after such a decision."
CH7_Main_13_023,"If I hadn't left...maybe things wouldn't have turned out so horribly..."
CH7_Main_13_024,"Gau, you had your own path to follow..."
CH7_Main_13_025,"This isn't your fault."
CH7_Main_14_001,"No!!!!!"
CH7_Main_14_002,"That voice...Pavel!!"
CH7_Main_14_003,"What in the world..."
CH7_Main_14_004,"Rodina: Pavel!! What's going on!!"
CH7_Main_14_005,"Pavel: Ugh...Tarkas...why..."
CH7_Main_14_006,"Tarkas: This woman, Arlette...she's the reason Kyle turned out that way."
CH7_Main_14_007,"Cleo: Arlette...? That person is..."
CH7_Main_14_008,"Wait for me, Pavel. I'll..."
CH7_Main_14_009,"Hah, too late. Come, Arlette. It's time to pay for your sins."
CH7_Main_14_010,"Arlette: ....."
CH7_Main_14_011,"Kasel: M...mother...."
CH7_Main_14_012,"Cleo: What? Kasel's...mother? But she's un...undead..."
CH7_Main_14_013,"Tarkas!!!"
CH7_Main_14_014,"Guh, damn you..."
CH7_Main_14_015,"We used too much power fighting Pavel."
CH7_Main_14_016,"We have to retreat for now!"
CH7_Main_14_017,"Ugh, can't be helped...We retreat, for now. Take Pavel."
CH7_Main_14_018,"I won't let you!!"
CH7_Main_14_019,"Arlette: ....."
CH7_Main_14_020,"Kasel: Mo..mother...how..."
CH7_Main_14_021,"Roi: Don't, Kasel! She's merely a corpse! She's Undead!!"
CH7_Main_14_022,"Frey: No, Kasel!!"
CH7_Main_14_023,"Kasel: Frey!!!"
CH7_Main_14_024,"Arlette: ....."
CH7_Main_14_025,"Frey: Ah....good...Kasel is...fine..."
CH7_Main_14_026,"Kasel: Fr...Frey...why...."
CH7_Main_14_027,"Frey: Kasel...you have to...save...the w..world..."
CH7_Main_14_028,"Frey: ....."
CH7_Main_14_029,"Kasel: Frey....Frey!!!"
CH7_Main_14_030,"No..no...this can't be..."
CH7_Main_14_031,"Wait...it seems we are the next targets."
CH7_Main_14_032,"This...can't..."
CH7_Main_14_033,"Damnit...it can't be helped."
CH7_Main_14_034,"Roi: Hraaaagh!!"
CH7_Main_14_035,"Roi: C'mon, all of you...get yourselves together!!"
CH7_Main_14_036,"Again...because of me..."
CH7_Main_14_037,"Because of me...Frey...you died because of me...."
CH7_Main_14_038,"Why...why me."
CH7_Main_14_039,"The Holy Sword...I never wanted it."
CH7_Main_14_040,"I'm done."
CH7_Main_14_041,"It's all over."
CH7_Main_14_042,"Kasel."
CH7_Main_14_043,"Fre....Frey?"
CH7_Main_14_044,"Why...did we come all this way."
CH7_Main_14_045,"The paths we walked...many others lost their lives. Nameless graves, unknown to anyone."
CH7_Main_14_046,"Even so, we needed to fight. We needed to protect ourselves."
CH7_Main_14_047,"This nay all be one horrible excuse, but it was needed to stop a bigger tragedy from happening."
CH7_Main_14_048,"No one wanted this, but the fate of this world was placed in our hands."
CH7_Main_14_049,"But...it's all over."
CH7_Main_14_050,"What could I do...without you."
CH7_Main_14_051,"I caused many deaths...now it's simply my turn."
CH7_Main_14_052,"Kasel..."
CH7_Main_14_053,"I don't want you to fall into the Darkness because of me."
CH7_Main_14_054,"My path was to keep you from being corrupted."
CH7_Main_14_055,"Please, Kasel."
CH7_Main_14_056,"Let me finish my job...stand, and fight."
CH7_Main_14_057,"Frey..."
CH7_Main_14_058,"I'll try. For you...I'll stand."
CH7_Main_14_059,"Thank you."
CH7_Main_14_060,"Thank you, Kasel."
CH7_Main_14_061,"This...this is..."
CH7_Main_14_062,"Frey...?"
CH7_Main_14_063,"Ho..how..."
CH7_Main_14_064,"Ka...sel...?"
CH7_Main_14_065,"I'm...alive?"
CH7_Main_14_066,"That...that's what I wanted to ask, Frey."
CH7_Main_14_067,"You're alive...right?"
CH7_Main_14_068,"I think so."
CH7_Main_14_069,"Frey~~!!"
CH7_Main_15_001,"They disappeared for now...but what were those wings?"
CH7_Main_15_002,"Wings?"
CH7_Main_15_003,"I dunno...they did look like those of an Angel, though."
CH7_Main_15_004,"But I never heard of Angels with such huge wings, nor did I know they could hide them..."
CH7_Main_15_005,"Kasel...are you ok?"
CH7_Main_15_006,"Yeah...thanks to you."
CH7_Main_15_007,"Thank you for being alive, Frey."
CH7_Main_15_008,"Yes."
CH7_Main_15_009,"Well, can't stay here forever."
CH7_Main_15_010,"Pavel, right? He probably knows a lot about all this."
CH7_Main_15_011,"Let's go and save him."
CH7_Main_16_001,"Rodina! Is Pavel safe?"
CH7_Main_16_002,"Yes, we saved him - but we should still be cautious."
CH7_Main_16_003,"What about Gau?"
CH7_Main_16_004,"He went after Tarkas."
CH7_Main_16_005,"We should deal with the Frost Giants in the vicinity first, then."
CH7_Main_17_001,"It seems we've dealt with most of them now."
CH7_Main_17_002,"Are you alright, Pavel?"
CH7_Main_17_003,"Are you Kasel...what about...Arlette..."
CH7_Main_17_004,"I finished her off. It was the only way."
CH7_Main_17_005,"....I see."
CH7_Main_17_006,"How did mother...turn into an Undead?"
CH7_Main_17_007,"She was killed by Undead, so it shouldn't come as a surprise."
CH7_Main_17_008,"When I arrived at your village...she had already turned into one of them."
CH7_Main_17_009,"You knew her...?"
CH7_Main_17_010,"Around 100 years ago...I sealed her in ice."
CH7_Main_17_011,"Around that time...she was already pregnant with you."
CH7_Main_17_012,"That...that means..."
CH7_Main_17_013,"You should know your lineage now."
CH7_Main_17_014,"Eh? What? What is this about?"
CH7_Main_17_015,"I...have the blood of Orvelian Royalty."
CH7_Main_17_016,"I knew I was a descendant of Kyle..."
CH7_Main_17_017,"But if that was 100 years ago...wouldn't that mean..."
CH7_Main_17_018,"Yeah..I guess that makes me...King Kyle's son."
CH7_Main_17_019,"Is that true, Pavel?"
CH7_Main_17_020,"Yes, it is."
CH7_Main_17_021,"Why...did you seal my mother in ice?"
CH7_Main_17_022,"Did she do anything wrong?"
CH7_Main_17_023,"No. It was nothing to me."
CH7_Main_17_024,"When she was trying to give up on life..."
CH7_Main_17_025,"I just...told her, it would all be fine after a good night's sleep."
CH7_Main_17_026,"Mother was...trying to give up on life?"
CH7_Main_17_027,"What happened?"
CH7_Main_17_028,"Arlette is a woman Kyle met on his journey to save the world from Demonkind."
CH7_Main_17_029,"When he left her to finish his journey, she was pregnant with you."
CH7_Main_17_030,"The Demons knew of this, and attacked her village, killing everyone."
CH7_Main_17_031,"Simply, they thought by killing everyone, they would be rid of you and her."
CH7_Main_17_032,"So how..did my mother survive?"
CH7_Main_17_033,"Before Kyle met your mother, she had a fiance."
CH7_Main_17_034,"While he broke up with her for her future..."
CH7_Main_17_035,"He came back to save her from death, dying in the process."
CH7_Main_17_036,"Arlette lost everything she loved. In the end, she wanted to die, hating herself and Kyle for all that happened."
CH7_Main_17_037,"I'm sorry to say this...but at that moment, she hated everything, even the baby inside her."
CH7_Main_17_038,"That was...what it was like."
CH7_Main_17_039,"Arlette...didn't love King Kyle?"
CH7_Main_17_040,"I have no knowledge of their exact thoughts."
CH7_Main_17_041,"I can only know what I have seen."
CH7_Main_17_042,"Thus, my story ends there."
CH7_Main_17_043,"Thank you for telling us. It all seems very complicated..."
CH7_Main_17_044,"Uh, what about my father...the man who raised me?"
CH7_Main_17_045,"He wasn't your biological father, while he was your guardian."
CH7_Main_17_046,"Wait, you're human, right...you lived over 100 years?"
CH7_Main_17_047,"I'll tell you about that later."
CH7_Main_18_001,"Hm. The Holy Sword's power is weak. Have you not recovered the rest of its power?"
CH7_Main_18_002,"We only recovered 1 part of the power."
CH7_Main_18_003,"Yes, I heard from Lorraine. So you didn't find Aeatola's portion?"
CH7_Main_18_004,"I did find it...but I decided that it was too dangerous to recover it at that moment."
CH7_Main_18_005,"I kept losing control of the Sword..."
CH7_Main_18_006,"I see. Tell me if you need to recover its power."
CH7_Main_18_007,"I will return the power I hold."
CH7_Main_18_008,"You have a fragment of Aea's power?"
CH7_Main_18_009,"Musuclow left it with me."
CH7_Main_18_010,"He knew that the Barbarian Kingdom would be in peril after he died."
CH7_Main_18_011,"King Musuclow..."
CH7_Main_18_012,"The power of the Holy Sword was divided into 3 parts."
CH7_Main_18_013,"As soon as you decide that you are capable of controlling the power by yourself, you will be able to complete the Sword."
CH7_Main_18_014,"Is there no way to stop the Demons without doing so?"
CH7_Main_18_015,"That is a useless question."
CH7_Main_18_016,"If they were so easy to stop, they would have never be a threat."
CH7_Main_18_017,".....You are right."
CH7_Main_18_018,"The Sword is the best way to save this world, after all..."
CH7_Main_18_019,"It is smart to be wary of a power too strong to control."
CH7_Main_18_020,"However, do know that it is not an issue you can put off forever."
CH7_Main_19_001,"As expected of you, Gau. I have heard rumors of you, but your skills are truly impressive."
CH7_Main_19_002,"I wanted to meet you face to face, Tarkas."
CH7_Main_19_003,"Why...why did you start war with us?"
CH7_Main_19_004,"Because human greed will be the end of this world."
CH7_Main_19_005,"Barbarians were merely the beginning. We plan to wipe out the human race completely."
CH7_Main_19_006,"I won't let you!!"
CH7_Main_19_007,"Hah, that was a good fight. Still, this is the end - you were no match for me."
CH7_Main_19_008,"Now, die."
CH7_Main_19_009,"Gau!!"
CH7_Main_19_010,"Grrk....This...is the Holy Sword, Aea..."
CH7_Main_19_011,"So you are Kyle's son."
CH7_Main_19_012,"Yes. I am the son of your friend, Kyle - my name is Kasel."
CH7_Main_19_013,"I never thought I would meet the son of Kyle here. Interesting..."
CH7_Main_19_014,"I will see you later, son of Kyle."
CH7_Main_20_001,"Welcome, son of Kyle."
CH7_Main_20_002,"So you were waiting for us."
CH7_Main_20_003,"Yes. I cannot allow Aea to stay in human hands."
CH7_Main_20_004,"It is a dangerous weapon. Even more so, as it was given to greedy humans who cannot control themselves."
CH7_Main_20_005,"I will destroy everything. Humanity, and the Holy Sword as well!"
CH7_Main_20_006,"Why were you after Arlette?"
CH7_Main_20_007,"If you wish to know that, work with me and destroy them."
CH7_Main_20_008,"My curiosity is not worth such a price."
CH7_Main_20_009,"Hmph, you too were originally human."
CH7_Main_20_010,"Die together with your former race!"
CH7_Main_21_001,"The King of Frost Giants, Tarkas...as expected, he is really strong."
CH7_Main_21_002,"So weak, son of Kyle. You disappoint me."
CH7_Main_21_003,"This is the end!!"
CH7_Main_21_004,"I won't allow it, Tarkas!!"
CH7_Main_21_005,"Even if it wasn't what I wanted..."
CH7_Main_21_006,"If I falter here...I can't save everyone...I can't save the world!"
CH7_Main_21_007,"Even if I am swallowed by Darkness once more, there is no other way!"
CH7_Main_21_008,"Pavel, the time is now! Return the power of the Holy Sword to me!"
CH7_Main_21_009,"I see. As agreed, I return the power to its rightful owner."
CH7_Main_21_010,"I feel it...the holy power welling up inside the Sword..."
CH7_Main_21_011,"Gugh..."
CH7_Main_21_011_00,"So you were the inheritor of the Holy Sword..."
CH7_Main_21_012,"So this...is as far as I go..."
CH7_Main_21_013,"Lua...why did you give the Sword to the humans..."
CH7_Main_21_014,"So fragile...so weak...so unstable..."
CH7_Main_22_001,"Is it over..."
CH7_Main_22_002,"If you are speaking of Tarkas, I would say so."
CH7_Main_22_003,"Thank you, Pavel. We are all fine, thanks to you."
CH7_Main_22_004,"No, it is because you decided to do what must be done."
CH7_Main_22_005,"Gau, considering Tarkas has fallen, the remaining Barbarians must be safe, right?"
CH7_Main_22_006,"I'll still try to convince the other races, to make sure of things."
CH7_Main_22_007,"When you try to speak with the Harpies, tell them this."
CH7_Main_22_008,"The Harpies back in Elidora, to the southeast of this place"
CH7_Main_22_009,"also made a deal with Demons in the past, so they shouldn't be too harsh on you."
CH7_Main_22_010,"Haha, well, I'll see what I can do."
CH7_Main_22_011,"Now, only the power with in the talisman of Aeatola remains."
CH7_Main_22_012,"Then, the Holy Sword will be whole again."
CH7_Main_22_013,"Kasel, will you recover the last portion of power?"
CH7_Main_22_014,"Frey, you tried to do your part even through death."
CH7_Main_22_015,"I should...do what's right. Even if it scares me."
CH7_Main_22_016,"What's so scary? We're all here with you."
CH7_Main_22_017,"Thanks, Cleo."
CH7_Main_22_018,"I suggest heading to the Dragia Volcano first, before that."
CH7_Main_22_019,"Have you heard that the volcano has become more active recently?"
CH7_Main_22_020,"Yes."
CH7_Main_22_021,"It is probably due to a large Dimensional Rift occuring at the site."
CH7_Main_22_022,"A Dimensional Rift?"
CH7_Main_22_023,"Ever since the Dimensional Gate opened 100 years ago, small Rifts occured here and there."
CH7_Main_22_024,"Is..is that so? That's...that's really dangerous."
CH7_Main_22_025,"So far, only small Rifts occured...but this time, the scale is different."
CH7_Main_22_026,"Considering the volcanic activity has calmed down to a certain extent...you should be able to enter the area."
CH7_Main_22_027,"For protection, I will grant you a shield of protective Frost Magic."
CH7_Main_22_028,"After everything is over, I'll meet up with Lewisia and help you with your journey."
CH7_Main_22_029,"Thank you. We'll head over to Dragia first, then."
CH7_Lei_1_001,"Huh, why is a child just walking around here in the open?"
CH7_Lei_1_002,"Is there something wrong?"
CH7_Lei_1_003,"It's dangerous. The enemy is targeting all humans, remember?"
CH7_Lei_1_004,"I don't think she's particularly in danger."
CH7_Lei_1_005,"Well, she is young and alone...that could be dangerous potentially."
CH7_Lei_1_006,"Still, after Miruru and Rodina...I don't think she'd be in that much trouble."
CH7_Lei_1_007,"Hey, it's dangerous around here."
CH7_Lei_1_008,"Eh? You are..."
CH7_Lei_1_009,"Wait...have I seen you somewhere before?"
CH7_Lei_1_010,"It's been a while, Gau."
CH7_Lei_1_011,"You are...Lei?"
CH7_Lei_1_012,"Hmm, I guess they know each other."
CH7_Lei_1_013,"Considering you are here...has the orphanage shut down?"
CH7_Lei_1_014,"Irin is in charge of it."
CH7_Lei_1_015,"Wait...you haven't grown at all!"
CH7_Lei_1_016,"Indeed."
CH7_Lei_1_017,"I mean...considering the time that has passed, this is a bit..."
CH7_Lei_1_018,"Lei...was it? Are you also...cursed?"
CH7_Lei_1_019,"What do you mean, cursed?"
CH7_Lei_1_020,"Well, we met this kid in the Aegina Desert, named Miruru."
CH7_Lei_1_021,"She apparently was under a curse that turned her body into that of a child."
CH7_Lei_1_023,"Hahaha, no, it's not a curse."
CH7_Lei_1_024,"Hmm...Well, it does seem different."
CH7_Lei_1_025,"I swear Miruru's mind also reverted to that of a child, but...this..."
CH7_Lei_1_026,"Lei...was different from the other children. She was calm, more mature...so she stood out."
CH7_Lei_1_027,"I was worried, Lei. You left behind nothing but a letter."
CH7_Lei_1_028,"Well, it's a relief you're safe and sound."
CH7_Lei_1_029,"Uh, you mentioned an orphanage?"
CH7_Lei_1_030,"Gau built an orphanage for children orphaned from wars."
CH7_Lei_1_031,"He may look rough, but he's a caring man."
CH7_Lei_1_032,"War orphans..."
CH7_Lei_1_033,"Many children were orphaned in the war with the Frost Giants."
CH7_Lei_1_034,"I couldn't just leave them unattended."
CH7_Lei_1_035,"So you were away from the battlefield to tend to the children."
CH7_Lei_1_036,"But...perhaps that caused even more people to die..."
CH7_Lei_1_037,"That's not true, Gau."
CH7_Lei_1_038,"Even if you did fight on the front lines, nothing would have changed."
CH7_Lei_1_039,"I guess so, Lei. Thanks."
CH7_Lei_1_040,"It's dangerous here, so lets go."
CH7_Lei_1_041,"Haha, it's fine, Gau. I have some business to attend to."
CH7_Lei_1_042,"See you later, then."
CH7_Lei_1_043,"Lei!!"
CH7_Lei_1_044,"Oh, that stubborn child..."
CH7_Lei_1_045,"I don't think you need to worry that much, Gau."
CH7_Lei_1_046,"Considering her growth and all, I don't think she's a normal person."
CH7_Lei_2_001,"Lei?"
CH7_Lei_2_002,"Ah, the people from before."
CH7_Lei_2_003,"So you're with the Ice Dragon."
CH7_Lei_2_004,"Ice Dragon?"
CH7_Lei_2_005,"Who are you? I think I've seen you before..."
CH7_Lei_2_006,"Hm, I see. You wouldn't recognize this form, after all."
CH7_Lei_2_007,"Ice Dragon....I guess you're talking about Pavel?"
CH7_Lei_2_008,"Hmm...Ice Dragon, you haven't told them about your identity yet?"
CH7_Lei_2_009,"I only spoke about what was needed."
CH7_Lei_2_010,"It seems I am not the only one who hasn't revealed their identity, though."
CH7_Lei_2_011,"Haha, no need to be so wary."
CH7_Lei_2_012,"Still...we need to hurry."
CH7_Lei_2_013,"Gau can't beat Tarkas on his own."
CH7_Lei_2_014,"You even know Tarkas...who are you?"
CH7_Lei_2_015,"That can wait. For now, we must hurry."
CH7_Lei_2_016,"You will know in due time."
CH7_Lei_3_001,"No!!"
CH7_Lei_3_003,"Sorry, but I need to stop you there, Tarkas. He's a friend of mine, after all."
CH7_Lei_3_004,"You...Lewisia!!"
CH7_Lei_3_005,"Hmm, not bad."
CH7_Lei_3_006,"I was worried for a second about what would happen if I wasn't able to unlock my power."
CH7_Lei_3_007,"Hm, so it was Lewisia. No wonder I thought you looked familiar."
CH7_Lei_3_008,"Lewisia...wasn't that another of King Kyle's companions?"
CH7_Lei_3_009,"Yeah...the Vampire, Lewisia."
CH7_Lei_3_010,"How did you suddenly turn into an adult?"
CH7_Lei_3_011,"This is her true form. I am more curious about why she turned into a child."
CH7_Lei_3_012,"Lewisia, you..."
CH7_Lei_3_013,"I understand why you hate the humans, Tarkas..."
CH7_Lei_3_014,"But the world is in danger, and this is no time for you to vent upon the humans."
CH7_Lei_3_015,"You don't understand anything, Lewisia. Everything that went wrong is the humans' fault!!"
CH7_Lei_3_016,"And yet, it is also the humans that were tasked with ending the conflict."
CH7_Lei_3_017,"Lua decreed so, Tarkas."
CH7_Lei_3_018,"....Point taken."
CH7_Lei_3_019,"Still...."
CH7_Lei_3_020,"No, it can wait. I will retreat, for now."
CH7_Lei_4_001,"...Gau?"
CH7_Lei_4_002,"Ah...what...what is going on...."
CH7_Lei_4_003,"Are you really...Lei?"
CH7_Lei_4_004,"I was using a false name just in case of trouble."
CH7_Lei_4_005,"My real name is Lewisia."
CH7_Lei_4_006,"100 years ago, I used too much of my power. Now, I am limited to this childish form."
CH7_Lei_4_007,"I unlocked my power temporarily to save you,"
CH7_Lei_4_008,"but I will soon revert back into my younger form."
CH7_Lei_4_009,"....So you were a hero. A savior of this world."
CH7_Lei_4_010,"I didn't want people to know that, it would just be a bother."
CH7_Lei_4_011,"I just wanted to mingle normally with people."
CH7_Lei_4_012,"Why?"
CH7_Lei_4_013,"So you could...drink their blood?!"
CH7_Lei_4_014,"*Sigh*...Well, vampires don't only drink blood."
CH7_Lei_4_015,"It is true that blood makes us strong, but we do not thirst for it."
CH7_Lei_4_016,"Anyway, I only wished to observe the humans while wandering carefreely."
CH7_Lei_4_017,"I wanted to see them rebuilding this world after all that had occured."
CH7_Lei_4_018,"Apparently, though, those carefree times are now over."
CH7_Lei_4_019,"Is that not so, Child of the Holy Blade."
CH7_Lei_4_020,"I guess you would have known."
CH7_Lei_4_021,"Do you know who is leading the Demons this time?"
CH7_Lei_4_022,"No...but, we do have a lead."
CH7_Lei_4_023,"Apparently it's not a demon, nor is it a person of this world."
CH7_Lei_4_024,"Someone called the Black Knight."
CH7_Lei_4_025,"Yes. It seems that Tarkas is helping the Black Knight."
CH7_Lei_4_026,"What?! That means he's made a deal with the Demons!"
CH7_Lei_4_027,"What a hypocrite, blaming humans for everything while he's...!!"
CH7_Lei_4_028,"Although..."
CH7_Lei_4_029,"it seems the Demons are not involved whatsoever in this situation."
CH7_Lei_4_030,"It does seem that they have some internal...issues."
CH7_Lei_4_031,"Is that why he was after Arlette."
CH7_Lei_4_032,"Arlette? A human like her couldn't be alive after all this time..."
CH7_Lei_4_033,"Wait, Pavel. Did you do something?"
CH7_Lei_4_034,"I'll speak about that...later."
CH7_Lei_4_035,"I explained the whole thing to these people just a bit ago."
CH7_Lei_4_036,"So the fact that my mother was put into a cold sleep wasn't common knowledge between the heroes..."
CH7_Lei_4_037,"Hmm? She was your mother?"
CH7_Lei_4_038,"I see...so she really was alive."
CH7_Lei_4_039,"Not...anymore."
CH7_Lei_4_040,"Anyway, we need to stop Tarkas for now."
CH7_Lei_4_041,"It would be nice if everything could end after a nice conversation, but that doesn't seem possible."
CH7_Lei_4_042,"Well, it was always like this. Right, Frey?"
CH7_Lei_4_043,"Sadly, yes."
CH7_Lei_4_044,"I won't be of much help, anymore. My strength is all gone, and I will soon become a child again."
CH7_Lei_4_045,"I will need some time to recover, and then I'll join you all."
CH7_Lei_4_046,"After I do, I will need your help to return to my prime."
CH7_Lei_5_001,"So, you are here."
CH7_Lei_5_002,"I hear you're allied with the Black Knight."
CH7_Lei_5_003,"You know he's in charge of the Demons, right?"
CH7_Lei_5_004,"You know of him?"
CH7_Lei_5_005,"Not much?"
CH7_Lei_5_006,"All we know is that he's in charge of the Demons."
CH7_Lei_5_007,"And you have the gall to say that the humans are the cause of all this strife?!"
CH7_Lei_5_008,"Hmph, you know nothing."
CH7_Lei_5_009,"Now...die before you learn anything more."
CH7_Lei_5_010,"Let me ask one last thing before we fight."
CH1_TutorialR_1_001,"Not bad for a squire. Still, I can't help but notice…"
CH1_TutorialR_1_002,"Um, is something wrong?"
CH1_TutorialR_1_003,"Your sword. It's too worn out to use in battle."
CH1_TutorialR_1_004,"Oh, I… didn't realize that."
CH1_TutorialR_1_005,"I wonder if I can get a new one from the store."
CH1_TutorialR_1_006,"No need to go back. Just take mine."
CH1_TutorialR_1_007,"Thank you, but... I don't know how to use daggers."
CH1_TutorialR_1_008,"Tsk, tsk. Didn’t you know you could gain loots during the adventure?"
CH1_TutorialR_1_009,"Even if you don't need it, you can always sell it to make a few extra gold!"
CH1_TutorialR_1_010,"Cleo's right. Here, I think these swords might be useful to you."
CH1_TutorialR_2_001,"Wow, two swords? Thank you, Roi."
CH1_TutorialR_2_002,"It's not high in quality, but it'll do for now."
CH1_TutorialR_2_003,"Don't worry, we can always try enhancing them."
CH1_TutorialR_2_004,"At the forge? Guess we'd be going back to Orvel after all."
CH1_TutorialR_2_005,"Roi, you idiot!"
CH1_TutorialR_2_006,"I've heard of gear enhancement before."
CH1_TutorialR_2_007,"It's when priests upgrade gear using other gear as material, right?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_008,"That's correct."
CH1_TutorialR_2_009,"Ooh, I've always wanted to try that! Teach me how!"
CH1_TutorialR_2_010,"Um… this is a different kind of magic than the spells you usually use."
CH1_TutorialR_2_011,"Can you at least tell me how it works? Please?"
CH1_TutorialR_2_012,"It's my duty as the great sorcerous to at least learn the theory."
CH1_TutorialR_2_013,"Lua is the goddess of light and creator of all."
CH1_TutorialR_2_014,"Though creation is beyond our abilities…"
CH1_TutorialR_2_015,"As Lua's disciples, we are capable of merging gear with similar mana flows."
CH1_TutorialR_2_016,"Right, and gear used in battle usually have similar mana flow."
CH1_TutorialR_2_017,"But I've heard that there's a chance of failing if your stream of consciousness slips off."
CH1_TutorialR_2_018,"Don't worry. Even though I'm still an apprentice, I've never failed in gear enhancement."
CH1_TutorialR_2_019,"I guess becoming a priestess is my calling."
CH1_TutorialR_3_001,"Participating in battle is really helping me with my combat skills."
CH1_TutorialR_3_002,"You shouldn't be neglecting your studies though."
CH1_TutorialR_3_003,"Ha ha, of course."
CH1_TutorialR_3_004,"I was planning on reading the warrior skill book to learn attributes just now."
CH1_TutorialR_4_001,"Hmm, I can't seem to find any useful loots around here."
CH1_TutorialR_4_002,"I know, right? All I found was this glittering rubbish."
CH1_TutorialR_4_003,"Oh, Cleo, that's…!!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_004,"Huh? Is something wrong, Frey?"
CH1_TutorialR_4_005,"That's a summoning stone!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_006,"With the help of Lua, we can summon powerful gear using that stone."
CH1_TutorialR_4_007,"I knew it! A great sorceress is bound to attract great items!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_008,"A great sorceress would probably recognize a summoning stone."
CH1_TutorialR_4_009,"Sh…shut up, Roi! You know this is the first time I've seen a summoning stone!"
CH1_TutorialR_4_010,"Cleo isn't a priestess, it's natural for her not to know."
CH1_TutorialR_4_011,"Since Cleo is the one who found the stone, I'll try to summon a wizard's gear."
CH1_TutorialR_5_001,"Welcome to May's General Shop!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_002,"We have weapon and armor that will suit a young, handsome knight!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_003,"Runes and magic powders are ready too, all just for you!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_004,"I hope you find what you need."
CH1_TutorialR_5_005,"But if you browse and leave without buying anything..."
CH1_TutorialR_5_006,"May will be very disappointed!"
CH1_TutorialR_5_007,"Heh. Looks like you have no choice, Mr. Young, Handsome Knight."
CH1_TutorialR_5_008,"Please stop, Cleo..."
Tutorial0308_1_001,"Roi, is something wrong?"
Tutorial0308_1_002,"I don't understand."
Tutorial0308_1_003,"There are demons on the loose, but people only seem to care about the ancient royal vault."
Tutorial0308_1_004,"Maybe the Orvelian Royaty doesn't know about the demons yet?"
Tutorial0308_1_005,"Probably not. The expedition would have returned and reported about the demons by now."
Tutorial0308_1_006,"Yet the Royal Guard are digging for gold in such peace."
Tutorial0308_1_007,"Who cares! Thanks to the royal vault, our pockets will be filled with gold."
Tutorial0308_1_008,"I guess the kingdom needs supplies as well, especially at a time like this."
Tutorial0308_1_009,"Maybe so..."
Tutorial0308_1_010,"Well, it's not my place to intervene. This isn't even my country."
Tutorial0308_1_011,"Still... I can't help but wonder. Would we be able to defeat the demons without any help?"
Tutorial0308_1_012,"No worries! Cleo, the great sorceress will--"
Tutorial0308_1_013,"We can always ask for help elsewhere."
Tutorial0308_1_014,"Roi! Don't interrupt me! Focus on your job as my guard!"
Tutorial0308_1_015,"Interrupting unnecessary speech doesn't come in the way of my job."
Tutorial0308_1_016,"What did you say?! Why you..."
Tutorial0308_1_017,"Cleo, maybe we can let Roi finish?"
Tutorial0308_1_018,"H-huh? Um... sure, if you want."
Tutorial0308_1_019,"Thank you."
Tutorial0308_1_020,"I'm only letting you speak only because Frey wants to hear the rest!"
Tutorial0308_1_021,"I wasn't thanking you."
Tutorial0308_1_022,"Stop! Both of you!"
Tutorial0308_1_023,"Roi, who else can help us?"
Tutorial0308_1_024,"I wasn't referring to a specific person."
Tutorial0308_1_025,"Have you ever heard of something called 'Guild'?"
Tutorial0308_1_026,"It sounds familiar... I think it's what you call a group of people gathered with the same purpose."
Tutorial0308_1_027,"Correct."
Tutorial0308_1_028,"We might as well visit the Guild Center to check if they have any Mercenary Guilds."
Tutorial0308_1_029,"Oh! Mercenary Guild sounds like a great idea!"
Tutorial0308_1_030,"I've only heard about merchant guilds or production guilds."
Tutorial0308_1_031,"It's no wonder. We don't usually work with members of the guild."
Tutorial0308_1_032,"Do you know where the Guild Center is?"
Tutorial0308_1_033,"Of course. I haven't been there before, but It's very close."
Tutorial0308_2_001,"Excuse me."
Tutorial0308_2_002,"Welcome. Please state your purpose of visit."
Tutorial0308_2_003,"We'd like to get help from the Mercenary Guild!"
Tutorial0308_2_004,"Huh? Aren't you... Cleo?"
Tutorial0308_2_005,"Do I know you?"
Tutorial0308_2_006,"Of course. My you've grown."
Tutorial0308_2_007,"Cleo doesn't seem to know you. How do you know her?"
Tutorial0308_2_008,"Oh, who among the Tower of Sages wouldn't know Cleo, the Red Tower's troublemaker?"
Tutorial0308_2_009,"Urg. You're from the Tower of Sages?"
Tutorial0308_2_010,"I have left the tower around... 5 years ago."
Tutorial0308_2_011,"Already gained fame as a troublemaker 5 years ago?"
Tutorial0308_2_012,"Forgive me for asking, but what is your name?"
Tutorial0308_2_013,"I'm Veronica, the Guild Center's Quartermaster."
Tutorial0308_2_014,"Let's stay in touch. I'd like to hear all about Cleo's past misdeeds."
Tutorial0308_2_015,"Shut up, Roi!"
Tutorial0308_2_016,"Why would someone from the Tower of Sages even be working at the Guild Center!"
Tutorial0308_2_017,"Why not? I take pride in my job."
Tutorial0308_2_018,"Cleo, you should apologize to Veronica."
Tutorial0308_2_019,"I...I'm Sorry..."
Tutorial0308_2_020,"Urrg, this is all because of Roi!!"
Tutorial0308_2_021,"I apologize for the commotion. In exchange, can you tell me about Cleo's past--"
Tutorial0308_2_022,"Roi, where are your manners? You shouldn't pry into a lady's past."
Tutorial0308_2_023,"Yeah, Roi! Where are your manners!"
Tutorial0308_2_024,"Haha..."
Tutorial0308_2_025,"Um, you seem entertained..."
Tutorial0308_2_026,"Yes, though I still don't know why Cleo is here..."
Tutorial0308_2_027,"She seems... different than the rumors I heard at the tower."
Tutorial0308_2_028,"Hmph! They're just jealous of my talent, and have nothing better to do than spreading rumors."
Tutorial0308_2_029,"Well..."
Tutorial0308_2_030,"The sorcerers from the Tower of the Sage don't usually spread groundless rumors..."
Tutorial0308_2_031,"Maybe you have changed since then, Cleo."
Tutorial0308_2_032,"......Maybe so."
Tutorial0308_2_033,"All jokes aside."
Tutorial0308_2_034,"I understand we can hire mercenaries here?"
Tutorial0308_2_035,"True, but I would like to suggest something else."
Tutorial0308_2_036,"How about joining a Guild?"
Tutorial0308_2_037,"Or you can always open a Guild yourself."
Tutorial0308_2_038,"Why would you suggest that?"
Tutorial0308_2_039,"It...It's just..."
Tutorial0308_2_040,"You seem to be hiding something from us."
Tutorial0308_2_041,"No, I--"
Tutorial0308_2_042,"Orvel keeps getting more and more suspicious."
Tutorial0308_2_043,"There seems to be a conspiracy going on..."
Tutorial0308_2_044,"It's a misunderstanding!"
Tutorial0308_2_045,"I just thought.... You guys seem very skilled, but also seem to be in need of money..."
Tutorial0308_2_046,"I'm... sorry if that sounded rude..."
Tutorial0308_2_047,"No it's... true."
Tutorial0308_2_048,"I don't know why you're looking for mercenaries"
Tutorial0308_2_049,"but joining a guild will definitely help you."
Tutorial0308_2_050,"Yes, you can always hire mercenaries, but becoming a member yourself..."
Tutorial0308_2_051,"It might bring you something much more valuable than gold..."
Tutorial0308_3_001,"It's been so long since our last visit to Orvel."
Tutorial0308_3_002,"Yes, we've been through much during our short adventure."
Tutorial0308_3_003,"I wonder what lays ahead of us."
Tutorial0308_3_004,"For now, let's forget everything and rest at the inn."
Tutorial0308_3_005,"Camping's great and all but... I miss sleeping in a bed!"
Tutorial0308_3_006,"I agree, we should rest while we can."
Tutorial0308_3_007,"Sounds good."
Tutorial0308_3_008,"I know a place for such occasion."
Tutorial0308_3_009,"You won't regret it."
Tutorial0308_4_001,"Can we stop by somewhere just near hear?"
Tutorial0308_4_002,"I'm sure it will be of help to you."
RaidTutorial_1_001,"Hello there! Are you here to slay the Flame Dragon? Do you mind if we join you?"
RaidTutorial_1_002,"Yanne~! Over here!"
RaidTutorial_1_003,"You seem way too excited, Mediana."
RaidTutorial_1_004,"Yes, this is my first dragon raid!"
RaidTutorial_1_005,"Better be careful. You can never be off guard when facing a dragon."
RaidTutorial_1_006,"But I'm with you, Yanne, why would I fear anything?"
RaidTutorial_1_007,"Oh, how rude of us not to introduce ourselves!"
RaidTutorial_1_008,"I'm Mediana."
RaidTutorial_1_009,"And this is the famous Dragon Slayer Yanne, slayer of the Mad Dragon Svelta!"
RaidTutorial_1_010,"Y..you're embarrassing me..."
RaidTutorial_1_011,"I'm just a simple monster hunter."
RaidTutorial_1_012,"I speak nothing but the truth, Yanne."
RaidTutorial_1_013,"Never mind her..."
RaidTutorial_1_014,"Should we go ahead?"
RaidTutorial_2_001,"Yanne! Our party members requested for a CC skill!"
RaidTutorial_2_002,"No problem, just concentrate and... attack!"
RaidTutorial_3_001,"Don't run away, Temeraire!"
RaidTutorial_3_002,"You're sick, you need my help!"
RaidTutorial_3_003,"It's no use."
RaidTutorial_3_004,"How would you cure a dragon driven mad by demons?"
RaidTutorial_3_005,"Mental illness is a form of sickness too."
RaidTutorial_3_006,"It can be cured with proper treatment and diagnoses. I will never give up!"
RaidTutorial_3_007,"Temeraire isn't mentally ill. 100 years ago, the Dark Lord's force--"
RaidTutorial_3_008,"That's not true."
RaidTutorial_3_009,"There's no such record that the Dark Lord made the dragons go mad using magic."
RaidTutorial_3_010,"Dragon's appearance might resemble that of mere reptiles, but they are beings of great intelligence."
RaidTutorial_3_011,"There must be an explanatory reason for their madness."
RaidTutorial_3_012,"Sure, sure, whatever you say."
RaidTutorial_3_013,"Careful, the hatchlings are approaching."
RaidTutorial_3_014,"Sweet babies, are you worried about your mama?"
RaidTutorial_3_015,"Don't be afraid, I'm here to cure her."
RaidTutorial_3_016,"Stop trying to tame them. The only way to get through is by defeating them!"
RaidTutorial_4_001,"You came back, Temeraire."
RaidTutorial_4_002,"Now, get ready for your treatment."
RaidTutorial_4_003,"Mediana, you shouldn't be diagnosing dragons with mental illness."
RaidTutorial_4_004,"...When you're the one that seems the most insane."
RaidTutorial_4_005,"I can proudly say that my mind is as healthy as anyone."
RaidTutorial_4_006,"And I never try out dangerous experiments on others."
RaidTutorial_4_007,"But... that dragon is a danger to everyone else, so..."
RaidTutorial_4_008,"Now, now Temeraire, don't be afraid~ Here comes the needle~!"
RaidTutorial_4_009,"Who should cure who..."
RaidTutorial_5_001,"Good work, everyone."
RaidTutorial_5_002,"Since this is your first battle against dragons, you can keep the loots."
RaidTutorial_5_003,"Is that all right with you, Mediana?"
RaidTutorial_5_004,"...Mediana?"
RaidTutorial_5_005,"Now there, Temeraire, don't worry."
RaidTutorial_5_006,"You will get the treatment you need."
RaidTutorial_5_007,"Though my cure may be a little rough..."
RaidTutorial_5_008,"It's all for your own good."
RaidTutorial_5_009,"Don't be afraid of my needle~!"
RaidTutorial_5_010,"I wonder what would happen if a fire dragon is injected with a fiery shot?"
RaidTutorial_5_011,"Fufufu... How interesting..."
RaidTutorial_5_012,"Ha..haha.. Um... I guess Mediana isn't interested..."
RaidTutorial_5_013,"So... take whatever you want."
RaidTutorial_5_014,"It was a pleasure to meet you."
RaidTutorial_6_001,"Humph, I did tell you that I can sharpen a blade fatal enough to catch a dragon..."
RaidTutorial_6_002,"But I'd never have guessed you'd actually go and hunt them down."
RaidTutorial_6_003,"I guess I can't call you newbies anymore."
RaidTutorial_6_004,"Judging by the loots you brought... Was it Temeraire?"
RaidTutorial_6_005,"Come by the forge again when you gather enough coins."
RaidTutorial_6_006,"I have some dragon gear lying around..."
RaidTutorial_6_007,"You can pay for them with the dragon's coins."
CONVERSATION_TU_49,"Hah, another fool with no sense of fear."
CONVERSATION_TU_50,"What is this place?"
CONVERSATION_TU_51,"This is the darkness hiding underneat Orvelia,"
CONVERSATION_TU_52,"where the demons captured during the ancient war have been locked away."
CONVERSATION_TU_53,"Yes, this is a prison."
CONVERSATION_TU_54,"It's literally hell down there, but I won't stop you if you dare to enter."
CONVERSATION_TU_55,"Best of luck."
CONVERSATION_TU_56,"Hey! You guys look pretty tough."
CONVERSATION_TU_57,"Are you talking about us?"
CONVERSATION_TU_58,"Would you be interested in a match?"
CONVERSATION_TU_59,"This place is full of contestants that put their lives on the line for honor!"
CONVERSATION_TU_60,"It's the perfect place for the likes of you!"
CONVERSATION_TU_80,"Materials... I need more materials!"
CONVERSATION_TU_81,"Bring me more money and materials, greenhorn!"
CONVERSATION_TU_82,"Who are you calling a greenhorn!"
CONVERSATION_TU_83,"Humph. Are you going adventuring with that kind of equipment?"
CONVERSATION_TU_84,"Your weapons are so dull, they can barely cut butter."
CONVERSATION_TU_85,"I'll fix them up sharp enough to cut through a dragon's scales."
CONVERSATION_TU_86,"That is, if you have enough gold and materials!"
CONVERSATION_TU_249,"Welcome to Hero's Inn!"
CONVERSATION_TU_250,"Ha ha! This house is full of heroes today."
CONVERSATION_TU_251,"Oh, Kasel! It's been a long time!"
CONVERSATION_TU_252,"For some reason, it feels like there are a lot of newcomers."
CONVERSATION_TU_253,"You will find a lot of adventurers these days because there are more demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_254,"They come looking for companions and end up staying a few days."
CONVERSATION_TU_255,"If you are also looking for companions, Kasel, do you want to meet them?"
CH8_Main_0_001,"It's so hot, even though Pavel cast Frost on us."
CH8_Main_0_002,"I think it got even hotter when we were going through Windland Snow Mountain."
CH8_Main_0_003,"Really? Why can't I feel anything?"
CH8_Main_0_004,"Probably because you're immune to heat."
CH8_Main_0_005,"Frey, do you think you can block the heat with your shield?"
CH8_Main_0_006,"I can block damage, but not heat... Sorry."
CH8_Main_0_007,"But there's a bigger problem... I feel a powerful evil energy from far away… "
CH8_Main_0_008,"Massive dark power is gathered at the top of the volcano."
CH8_Main_0_009,"So, there really is something wrong with the Dragia Volcano."
CH8_Main_0_010,"But didn't the Mad Dragon Temeraire build its lair on Dragia Volcano?"
CH8_Main_0_011,"No one would even dare go near that place. Unless it's someone completely stupid."
CH8_Main_0_012,"The Mad Dragon Temeraire?"
CH8_Main_0_013,"I think I heard about it back at the Tower of Sage."
CH8_Main_0_014,"If my memory is correct... Isn't it the ancient Red Dragon?"
CH8_Main_0_015,"Well, it's just a mad dragon now."
CH8_Main_0_016,"There's a rumor that a hundred years ago, the Demons did something to it that drove the dragon into insanity."
CH8_Main_0_017,"I don't know all the details…"
CH8_Main_0_018,"Anyway, that's not the point here."
CH8_Main_0_019,"The real problem is that there's someone crazy enough to inject evil energy into the mad dragon's lair."
CH8_Main_0_020,"Things are starting to get out of hand."
CH8_Main_0_021,"Creating a dimensional rift in such place..."
CH8_Main_0_022,"What could the Demons be up to?"
CH8_Main_0_023,"We need to find out what's going on."
CH8_Main_0_024,"We may not be able to figure this out now, but we can get some information... Hm?"
CH8_Main_0_025,"Why is the Holy Sword...?"
CH8_Main_0_026,"Kuh...!"
CH8_Main_0_027,"Kasel! What's wrong?"
CH8_Main_0_028,"Ugh... Yea. I'm okay, Frey."
CH8_Main_0_029,"I'm not sure why..."
CH8_Main_0_030,"But the Holy Sword is reacting to something."
CH8_Main_0_031,"The last power's fragment would be the only thing that would make the Holy Sword react like this."
CH8_Main_0_032,"Isn't Kaulah storing the last fragment of the Holy Sword's power?"
CH8_Main_0_033,"Anyway. Nothing will get done if we just stay here."
CH8_Main_0_034,"Let's head to the volcano."
CH8_Main_0_035,"At the very least, we should be able to learn something new."
CH8_Main_1_001,"We can't get to the volcano from here."
CH8_Main_1_002,"Yes, there is a river of lava trickling from the volcano..."
CH8_Main_1_003,"Pavel's frost won't be enough to protect us."
CH8_Main_1_004,"Maybe we can try to fly over it on my staff."
CH8_Main_1_005,"We'd need some high flying magic that can last a long time, though,"
CH8_Main_1_006,"It's just too dangerous to cross it with common flying magic."
CH8_Main_1_007,"Of course, it would be okay if Cleo went alone since she can withstand the fire."
CH8_Main_1_008,"Hm... What now?"
CH8_Main_1_009,"Should we go back to Windland and ask for Pavel's help?"
CH8_Main_1_010,"For now, let's go to the northwest since that path seems clear enough."
CH8_Main_1_011,"I'm not sure what we'll do if the lava blocks our way again..."
CH8_Main_2_001,"What's wrong?"
CH8_Main_2_002,"New intruders."
CH8_Main_2_003,"Four humans, including the wielder of the Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_2_004,"Hmph. I guess Malduk mentioned that one earlier."
CH8_Main_2_005,"Alright. Send a unit."
CH8_Main_2_006,"It should be okay to kill them all."
CH8_Main_2_007,"Understood."
CH8_Main_2_008,"Wait. What about the other intruders?"
CH8_Main_2_009,"Dragon's scent detected. Pursuing unit formed."
CH8_Main_2_010,"Falsified traces... Dwarf trap activated."
CH8_Main_2_011,"Draconics, two injured, one dead."
CH8_Main_2_012,"Still in pursuit."
CH8_Main_2_013,"Bah. Weaklings... They're resorting to some annoying tricks."
CH8_Main_2_014,"Alright. I can kill them anytime."
CH8_Main_2_015,"Just bring the dragon to me."
CH8_Main_2_016,"A dragon in one piece. I won't kill it quickly, you know."
CH8_Main_2_017,"I'm excited, hahahaha... Bwahahaha!"
CH8_Main_2_018,"Hmph. You seriously can't give up that bad habit of playing with your prey before killing it."
CH8_Main_2_019,"You and that Kalax..."
CH8_Main_2_020,"Tsk, Morrah..."
CH8_Main_2_021,"It's been a while. So, how is it working for a lowly human?"
CH8_Main_2_022,"…"
CH8_Main_2_023,"!!!"
CH8_Main_2_024,"If you insult Maria in front of me again..."
CH8_Main_2_025,"I'll lop off your head."
CH8_Main_2_026,"Hmph. I'd like to see you try."
CH8_Main_2_027,"You haven't been our leader for a long time, Morrah."
CH8_Main_2_028,"You're the still same after a hundred years. We've grown stronger."
CH8_Main_2_029,"All this time, we've been hunting and eating dragons."
CH8_Main_2_030,"Hmph. Know your place, Infira."
CH8_Main_2_031,"Your body has changed because of the souls of the dragons you ate. You're still just small fry."
CH8_Main_2_032,"If you don't want to be called that, try absorbing at least one soul from an ancient dragon."
CH8_Main_2_033,"Bwahahaha, you're saying I can't handle the soul of an ancient dragon?"
CH8_Main_2_034,"Alright, I'll prove it."
CH8_Main_2_035,"The prey this time is the Blue Dragon that was once worshiped as the God Dragon."
CH8_Main_2_036,"It's a big shot amongst the dragons that oversee the world."
CH8_Main_2_037,"I'd like to see you try, just like you said."
CH8_Main_2_038,"Well, it doesn't matter. I'll just do what I'm told."
CH8_Main_2_039,"Whatever you do, if it doesn't affect my mission, I have no reason to intervene."
CH8_Main_2_040,"I forgot to ask."
CH8_Main_2_041,"What brings you here?"
CH8_Main_2_042,"You ask the obvious."
CH8_Main_2_043,"The dimensional rifts disappeared in the places they've passed by."
CH8_Main_2_044,"Maria was worried that it would cause problems to his plan."
CH8_Main_2_045,"That's why she sent me here. It's the biggest and most important dimensional rift."
CH8_Main_2_046,"Hmph. Even the ancient Fire Dragon Temeraire is in my hands now."
CH8_Main_2_047,"He gave me this power of erosion that can even control dragons' minds."
CH8_Main_2_048,"With this, even the Dragia Volcano is impregnable!"
CH8_Main_2_049,"Heh. You mean the one that turned into Mad Dragon a hundred years ago?"
CH8_Main_2_050,"What's the point of controlling a mindless beast like that?"
CH8_Main_2_051,"It doesn't matter, so long as you can control its power."
CH8_Main_2_052,"Tsk. Let's see how long you can keep talking big like that, Morrah."
CH8_Main_2_053,"Just watch. Once this mission is over, I'll show who is the strongest."
CH8_Main_2_054,"That's only if you complete your mission."
CH8_Main_2_055,"Don't underestimate the wielder of the Holy Sword, Infira."
CH8_Main_2_056,"We don't know what might happen to this place."
CH8_Main_2_057,"Hmph. Just don't get in the way, Morrah."
CH8_Main_2_058,"I don't need your help."
CH8_Main_2_059,"Heh. Good to hear."
CH8_Main_2_060,"I wouldn't help you, anyway, even if you got on your knees and begged."
CH8_Main_2_061,"Just remember this. If you get in my way, or this job goes wrong..."
CH8_Main_2_062,"I'm taking your head."
CH8_Main_3_001,"...!? What's this energy?"
CH8_Main_3_002,"This incredible mana... What's going on...?"
CH8_Main_3_003,"A demon with the power of fire!?"
CH8_Main_3_004,"This is... Morrah! It's similar to Morrah's energy!"
CH8_Main_3_005,"Kuh, the killing intent itself is so intense...!"
CH8_Main_3_006,"Everyone, be careful!"
CH8_Main_3_007,"Hmph, I'll show you the power of an Archmage!"
CH8_Main_3_008,"…?!"
CH8_Main_3_009,"My fire magic isn't working...?"
CH8_Main_3_010,"This happened when we fought Morrah as well..."
CH8_Main_3_011,"In that case…!"
CH8_Main_3_012,"Kasel, don't push yourself too far!"
CH8_Main_3_013,"Whew... whew... Alright!"
CH8_Main_3_014,"It's okay, Frey. I'm used to this power now!"
CH8_Main_3_015,"Alright, here I go, Demon!"
CH8_Main_4_001,"Grrr, kugh…"
CH8_Main_4_002,"Haaaa!!"
CH8_Main_4_003,"Tsk!"
CH8_Main_4_004,"You think I'll lose you!"
CH8_Main_4_005,"…!"
CH8_Main_4_006,"In the name of the Goddess...!"
CH8_Main_4_007,"Haaa!"
CH8_Main_4_008,"Tsk, was it too low...? I just missed the vital point..."
CH8_Main_4_009,"Kuh!"
CH8_Main_4_010,"Roi!!"
CH8_Main_4_011,"Go, Fire Ball!"
CH8_Main_4_012,"Ugh, my fire magic isn't working...!"
CH8_Main_4_013,"Aaaaaah!"
CH8_Main_4_014,"No, Frey!!!"
CH8_Main_4_015,"Aaaaaah!!"
CH8_Main_4_016,"Kuh, haaaa!!"
CH8_Main_4_017,"Roi!!"
CH8_Main_4_018,"Kuh, damn it!"
CH8_Main_4_019,"Move back, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_4_020,"Kuh, he keeps dodging...!"
CH8_Main_4_021,"Is he not fighting head-on because he knows it's the Holy Sword...!?"
CH8_Main_4_022,"!!!!"
CH8_Main_4_023,"Everyone, dodge!"
CH8_Main_4_024,"No, there's no need."
CH8_Main_4_025,"Thank you, Yanne."
CH8_Main_4_026,"Stand up, everyone."
CH8_Main_4_027,"Hm...?"
CH8_Main_4_028,"Frey! Are you okay!?"
CH8_Main_4_029,"Yes. Yes. I'm okay. I can get up."
CH8_Main_4_030,"Bwahahaha, it's been a while, everyone!"
CH8_Main_4_031,"Phillop!?"
CH8_Main_4_032,"Save the talk for later! We need to get rid of the remaining Draconics!"
CH8_Main_4_033,"Oh, don't worry! I beat them all up a little earlier!"
CH8_Main_4_034,"Alright, I'll show you how to hunt Draconics!"
CH8_Main_4_035,"Okay!"
CH8_Main_5_001,"*Huff...* We defeated them all somehow..."
CH8_Main_5_002,"Thank you so much. If you hadn't helped us..."
CH8_Main_5_003,"Hahaha. Anyone would've done what I did in that situation."
CH8_Main_5_004,"Anyway. You've all grown strong."
CH8_Main_5_005,"Did you retrieve the power of the Holy Sword that the Barbarians had?"
CH8_Main_5_006,"Yes. A wizard named Pavel had it."
CH8_Main_5_007,"By the way, you two were comrades a hundred years ago, right?"
CH8_Main_5_008,"Ah, yes, Pavel. That's who you meant."
CH8_Main_5_009,"He was always pretty quiet, so we didn't get to talk much."
CH8_Main_5_010,"His frost magic was truly awesome, though."
CH8_Main_5_011,"Hahaha, I guess he always was the silent type."
CH8_Main_5_012,"Oh, that reminds me..."
CH8_Main_5_013,"I still haven't said hello to the others behind you."
CH8_Main_5_014,"I'm Kasel. And these are Frey, Cleo, and Roi."
CH8_Main_5_015,"Thank you for helping us."
CH8_Main_5_016,"Like Phillop said, we just did what we had to do. Don't worry about it."
CH8_Main_5_017,"I'm Yanne, a Barbarian hunter. You could say I'm just an ordinary monster hunter."
CH8_Main_5_018,"Hm? Barbarian..."
CH8_Main_5_019,"I'm the Priestess of Water, Laias."
CH8_Main_5_020,"I came from the Shrine of Flow that is under the oasis in Aegina Desert."
CH8_Main_5_021,"Hm? Laias... That Laias!?"
CH8_Main_5_022,"That legendary Blue Dragon worshiped as the God Dragon in the desert country!?"
CH8_Main_5_023,"Oh? There are still people around who know that story?"
CH8_Main_5_024,"I'm flattered... It wasn't really a huge deal."
CH8_Main_5_025,"I just called the rain and made the lands fertile sometimes..."
CH8_Main_5_026,"Other than that..."
CH8_Main_5_027,"Ha ha, you are so humble."
CH8_Main_5_028,"If it weren't for you, Aegina Desert would've been a wasteland forever."
CH8_Main_5_029,"And Yanne, didn't you beat up a Mad Dragon by yourself a few years ago?"
CH8_Main_5_030,"Ah, Mad Dragon Svelta. It was an aloof and prideful dragon in the past."
CH8_Main_5_031,"Although it became a Mad Dragon a hundred years ago because of the Demons..."
CH8_Main_5_032,"His soul was distorted with anger and pain."
CH8_Main_5_033,"It was you who helped him go back into the flow of the world."
CH8_Main_5_034,"If you could please not mention that... hahaha..."
CH8_Main_5_035,"I only helped because people just asked me for help..."
CH8_Main_5_036,"And talking about that with another dragon present is..."
CH8_Main_5_037,"I'm sorry for interrupting, but..."
CH8_Main_5_038,"May I ask what brings you to Dragia...?"
CH8_Main_5_039,"You don't have to be so polite, Child of Fire."
CH8_Main_5_040,"Let's say... We're here because of the large Demon army that attacked the Aegina Desert."
CH8_Main_5_041,"I was cleaning up the remnants of the Undead,"
CH8_Main_5_042,"when a bunch of Demons came from the Dragia Volcano."
CH8_Main_5_043,"There wasn't much going on in the volcano when I was leaving..."
CH8_Main_5_044,"Then, the dimensional rift in the volcano must have appeared recently."
CH8_Main_5_045,"That's when the Demon army started coming over..."
CH8_Main_5_046,"Yes. They even reached the oasis."
CH8_Main_5_047,"With the Draconics that were made to hunt other dragons at the forefront..."
CH8_Main_5_048,"My younger brother sensed their threat, so he woke me up from my 100-year sleep."
CH8_Main_5_049,"And then, with the help of Phillop, we were able to push back the Demons to the border of Aegina."
CH8_Main_5_050,"I've fought many Draconics in the past."
CH8_Main_5_051,"I know how they fight and the kinds of strategies they like to use."
CH8_Main_5_052,"But when we were about to leave to Dragia to find out the cause, I saw it."
CH8_Main_5_053,"The ancient Fire Dragon Temeraire was causing a ruckus in Aegina, controlled by Draconics..."
CH8_Main_5_054,"We barely stopped him, but he flew in the direction of Dragia."
CH8_Main_5_055,"That's why before coming to Dragia, I asked Yanne for help since she has experience fighting a Mad Dragon."
CH8_Main_5_056,"I have many acquaintances around here since I hunt monsters,"
CH8_Main_5_057,"so I heard about it through the Hunter's Guild."
CH8_Main_5_058,"I had just finished hunting a giant scorpion, so I joined right away."
CH8_Main_5_059,"I see... So that's what happened."
CH8_Main_5_060,"I thought Aegina Desert would be fine since there aren't many Undeads there..."
CH8_Main_5_061,"In order to protect Aegina from the threat of the Demons,"
CH8_Main_5_062,"we'll have to get rid of the dimensional rift in Dragia."
CH8_Main_6_001,"By the way, I guess it was true that dragons fall asleep for a long time!"
CH8_Main_6_002,"Hm? But wait..."
CH8_Main_6_003,"If you were asleep for 100 years... Were you with the Warrior of the Holy Sword during the Demon War?"
CH8_Main_6_004,"Ha ha, I'm sorry, but I wasn't part of them."
CH8_Main_6_005,"Protecting the children of the desert was my priority..."
CH8_Main_6_006,"Oh, right. Phillop was the first member I met from the Warrior's party."
CH8_Main_6_007,"Ha ha, I always knew Dwarves were honest, reliable, and trustworthy."
CH8_Main_6_008,"Ahem... Priestess, you flatter me too much."
CH8_Main_6_009,"Why is everyone looking at me like that? It's too much."
CH8_Main_6_010,"Tarkas did a lot more than me!"
CH8_Main_6_011,"By the way, didn't you go to Windland?"
CH8_Main_6_012,"You met Tarkas, right? How is he doing?"
CH8_Main_6_013,"…"
CH8_Main_6_014,"…"
CH8_Main_6_015,"Hm? Why are you making that face?"
CH8_Main_6_016,"After Musuclow died, Tarkas declared war on the Barbarian Kingdom."
CH8_Main_6_017,"He rallied the other races of Windland, and started killing the Barbarians."
CH8_Main_6_018,"...?!"
CH8_Main_6_019,"What? How did that happen?"
CH8_Main_6_020,"He said that the humans and their ambition... make the world dangerous."
CH8_Main_6_021,"He declared that he would destroy the Holy Sword, mankind, everything..."
CH8_Main_6_022,"He tried to kill us, too."
CH8_Main_6_023,"In the end, I unlocked the power of the Holy Sword... and slashed him down."
CH8_Main_6_024,"He was so close to Kyle..."
CH8_Main_6_025,"Tarkas... Why...?"
CH8_Main_6_026,"Phillop couldn't have known that. But Yanne, you don't look so surprised."
CH8_Main_6_027,"I heard the news... a while back."
CH8_Main_6_028,"I was in search of work wandering the continent, so I was lucky."
CH8_Main_6_029,"It's lamentable what happened to my people... But it's not like there's no hope."
CH8_Main_6_030,"Even if the kingdom is gone, not all the Barbarians were killed."
CH8_Main_6_031,"Right now, they are led by the chief warrior Gau, signing peace agreements with the other races. They're barely keeping the peace."
CH8_Main_6_032,"They'll have another king later, but first, they have to focus on survival and rebuild."
CH8_Main_6_033,"That's something, at least. Gau is alive and well..."
CH8_Main_6_034,"So did Tarkas cooperate with the Black Knight or not?"
CH8_Main_6_035,"According to the information from Lewisia, that's still unconfirmed..."
CH8_Main_6_036,"Tarkas didn't explain anything until the end."
CH8_Main_6_037,"You've already met Lewisia, the Vampire Princess. Hm..."
CH8_Main_6_038,"It doesn't make sense for Tarkas to cooperate with the Demons so easily."
CH8_Main_6_039,"He had great pride as a warrior. I can't believe he would have just succumbed to the Demons."
CH8_Main_6_040,"I'm sure he had a reason."
CH8_Main_6_041,"I believe I said this earlier, but..."
CH8_Main_6_042,"Nothing will get solved by us just standing here."
CH8_Main_6_043,"We just need to do what we can."
CH8_Main_6_044,"Then let's move to the west, where the Draconics aren't doing much."
CH8_Main_6_045,"It will be the long way, but it will be safer."
CH8_Main_7_001,"So there are turtles and Muhrooms in the volcano, too."
CH8_Main_7_002,"They can actually live in such a hot place..."
CH8_Main_7_003,"Can we grill them?"
CH8_Main_7_004,"Hm? Is it that hot?"
CH8_Main_7_005,"It doesn't feel hot to me..."
CH8_Main_7_006,"Phillop is a Dwarf, and Laias is a dragon, so I understand,"
CH8_Main_7_007,"but how are you able to deal with this heat, Yanne?"
CH8_Main_7_008,"You have resistance to fire like me?"
CH8_Main_7_009,"I'm not sure,"
CH8_Main_7_010,"but I got covered in Svelta's blood when I hunted it."
CH8_Main_7_011,"Hm... Or it might have something to do with the dragon meat I ate after that?"
CH8_Main_7_012,"Dragon meat...?"
CH8_Main_7_013,"I shared the dragon's scales, bones, and useful parts with the residents"
CH8_Main_7_014,"to help them rebuild the village that Svelta had destroyed."
CH8_Main_7_015,"But then, so many of the people were starving."
CH8_Main_7_016,"So I cut out Svelta's meat to share with them, and I ate some myself."
CH8_Main_7_017,"Ever since that, I've never gotten ill, and I don't get hurt as much."
CH8_Main_7_018,"A dragon's body is imbued with the power of nature, so it can be a powerful magic catalyst."
CH8_Main_7_019,"In the past, there were people who wanted to hunt dragons for that reason... but no one survived."
CH8_Main_7_020,"If you had eaten the dragon for your own selfish interests, I would be angry."
CH8_Main_7_021,"It's clear that your intentions were good, though, so I'd like to praise you, Yanne."
CH8_Main_7_022,"I'm sure Svelta would have been relieved to know that he was"
CH8_Main_7_023,"useful to the earthly beings before leaving."
CH8_Main_7_024,"Hmm... I see."
CH8_Main_7_025,"Anyway, talking about food makes me hungry."
CH8_Main_7_026,"If there's not enough food, how about monster meat?"
CH8_Main_7_027,"It's pretty good!"
CH8_Main_7_028,"…!!"
CH8_Main_7_029,"What about Bloodsucking Spider legs...?"
CH8_Main_7_030,"I've tried it. It's so chewy and good."
CH8_Main_7_031,"Well, what about Muhrooms...?"
CH8_Main_7_032,"Muhrooms are good when grilled. Just like meat."
CH8_Main_7_033,"Maybe it's because they're mushroom monsters?"
CH8_Main_7_034,"…"
CH8_Main_7_035,"…"
CH8_Main_7_036,"Hah…"
CH8_Main_8_001,"Hm. Another lava river."
CH8_Main_8_002,"I don't see a way around it..."
CH8_Main_8_003,"There's nothing to worry about."
CH8_Main_8_004,"We have a dragon!"
CH8_Main_8_005,"We'll be fine if we fly over it!"
CH8_Main_8_006,"Well... This morphed form suppresses some of my powers."
CH8_Main_8_007,"If I go back to my dragon form, all my power will be unlocked."
CH8_Main_8_008,"Then, all the Draconics in this area will react to that power and go berserk."
CH8_Main_8_009,"I don't think we can deal with both Temeraire and that large army of Draconics."
CH8_Main_8_010,"Hm... That would definitely be dangerous."
CH8_Main_8_011,"Do Draconics always go berserk when they only react to the power of dragons?"
CH8_Main_8_012,"I'm not sure about that... But they don't go berserk when I'm in my morphed form."
CH8_Main_8_013,"I'm not sure if they don't feel the need to go berserk when my powers are hidden, or they just don't..."
CH8_Main_8_014,"Hm. So, that's why you're in that form..."
CH8_Main_8_015,"Then how do we cross the lava river?"
CH8_Main_8_016,"It's not like there's no way in this form."
CH8_Main_8_017,"It can be a little dangerous, so I'll create a shield."
CH8_Main_8_018,"Embrace -"
CH8_Main_8_019,"This is... a water shield?"
CH8_Main_8_020,"It's different from Frey's holy shield."
CH8_Main_8_021,"You better cover your ears."
CH8_Main_8_022,"Well, you'll get used to it after a few times."
CH8_Main_8_023,"???"
CH8_Main_8_024,"Overflow -"
CH8_Main_8_025,"…"
CH8_Main_8_026,"The waterfall is going into the lava..."
CH8_Main_8_027,"Wow, look at all that vapor...!"
CH8_Main_8_028,"If it wasn't for the shield, we would've been burned..."
CH8_Main_8_029,"I can just harden the lava temporarily, without the need to fly over, right?"
CH8_Main_8_030,"Ha ha, it will start flowing again after some time."
CH8_Main_8_031,"Oh, the heat will be dispersed by the Bubble Shield, so it should be fine."
CH8_Main_8_032,"I... didn't think of this."
CH8_Main_8_033,"As expected of a dragon!"
CH8_Main_8_034,"Well, water is the specialty of the Blue Dragon."
CH8_Main_8_035,"Ha ha, shall we get going then?"
CH8_Main_9_001,"Now that we crossed the lava river..."
CH8_Main_9_002,"Let's talk about what we should do next."
CH8_Main_9_003,"First, we need to take care of the mind control on Temeraire."
CH8_Main_9_004,"As long as he's there, we cannot enter the Dragia Volcano."
CH8_Main_9_005,"Fighting strong Demons and the ancient Red Dragon at the same time..."
CH8_Main_9_006,"I don't even want to think about it."
CH8_Main_9_007,"That's why we better separate the Draconics and Temeraire first."
CH8_Main_9_008,"After that, we can remove the control over Temeraire's mind, or at least seal his movements."
CH8_Main_9_009,"That's why we got away from where the Draconics are."
CH8_Main_9_010,"Hahaha, we scouted this area out a few days ago."
CH8_Main_9_011,"There aren't many Draconics to the northwest of here."
CH8_Main_9_012,"We saw some scouts coming, but they're just flying around."
CH8_Main_9_013,"There are also monsters scattered around the volcano, but that's no problem."
CH8_Main_9_014,"There are a few hidden caves to the northwest of here that lead to the Dwarven Kingdom."
CH8_Main_9_015,"The Dwarves have set a lot of traps around there to protect the land."
CH8_Main_9_016,"Even Draconics won't be able to access it easily."
CH8_Main_9_017,"Draconics are Demons that were made to hunt dragons."
CH8_Main_9_018,"If they find out my location, they'll come and hunt me down."
CH8_Main_9_019,"But if it's an area dangerous for them..."
CH8_Main_9_020,"They will choose the most efficient way."
CH8_Main_9_021,"They will use Temeraire, since traps won't work on him."
CH8_Main_9_022,"I get it. You want to use their own strategy against them."
CH8_Main_9_023,"I like that plan."
CH8_Main_9_024,"But I have two questions before that..."
CH8_Main_9_025,"What's the chance that the Draconics and Temeraire will attack together?"
CH8_Main_9_026,"Very low."
CH8_Main_9_027,"Temeraire is a Mad Dragon. He doesn't care what's around him and just uses his full power."
CH8_Main_9_028,"Even the powerful Draconics will be danger if they get caught in battle around him repeatedly."
CH8_Main_9_029,"Hm, understood."
CH8_Main_9_030,"Then, my next question."
CH8_Main_9_031,"Do we have a plan if Temeraire comes here?"
CH8_Main_9_032,"While we take care of Temeraire,"
CH8_Main_9_033,"Yanne will shoot an arrow with a purging spell at Temeraire's head."
CH8_Main_9_034,"That should remove the mind control on Temeraire, forcing him to sleep."
CH8_Main_9_035,"Hm..."
CH8_Main_9_036,"What if that fails?"
CH8_Main_9_037,"Then... We'll have to defeat Temeraire with force."
CH8_Main_9_038,"I don't want to hurt my old friend anymore..."
CH8_Main_9_039,"But I'll do it if it comes to that."
CH8_Main_10_001,"Enemy... Found."
CH8_Main_10_002,"Kill them all, except for the dragon."
CH8_Main_10_003,"Die...!!!"
CH8_Main_10_004,"Ha ha."
CH8_Main_10_005,"I'd like to see you try, you wannabe dragons."
CH8_Main_10_006,"In the name of Laias, the water of life, and the adjuster of the flow of the world..."
CH8_Main_10_007,"I'll annihilate you."
CH8_Main_11_001,"Kuh...!"
CH8_Main_11_002,"Serious injuries... Retreat!!!"
CH8_Main_11_003,"We better report to Infira..."
CH8_Main_11_004,"The bait has been set."
CH8_Main_11_005,"Now we just need to wait for Temeraire to come here."
CH8_Main_11_006,"If their leader is Infira... I think we'll succeed."
CH8_Main_11_007,"If he's anything like before, he'll let his impatience get the best of him."
CH8_Main_11_008,"Infira... Who is that?"
CH8_Main_11_009,"I don't think his name was mentioned in any of the books I've read in the Tower of Sage."
CH8_Main_11_010,"Infira is one of the commanders of the Draconics."
CH8_Main_11_011,"He's a wizard that uses the fire of hell, and he's very powerful."
CH8_Main_11_012,"He was an adviser to a special unit made up of only Draconics during the Demon War."
CH8_Main_11_013,"Oh? A wizard that uses fire."
CH8_Main_11_014,"Wh-what?"
CH8_Main_11_015,"Why are you looking at me like that?"
CH8_Main_11_016,"Roi, is it because my magic doesn't work on Draconics!?"
CH8_Main_11_017,"Hm? I didn't say anything."
CH8_Main_11_018,"I'm just wondering who is more skilled with fire magic, between you and Infira."
CH8_Main_11_019,"You shouldn't compare me to a Demon!"
CH8_Main_11_020,"Ha ha, humans are funny."
CH8_Main_11_021,"Looking at human friends is always an interesting thing to do."
CH8_Main_11_022,"Right?"
CH8_Main_11_023,"They go really well together."
CH8_Main_11_024,"No!!!"
CH8_Main_11_025,"By the way, Laias, you're... different earlier. What was that...?"
CH8_Main_11_026,"I felt overpowered..."
CH8_Main_11_027,"Oh, sorry. Ha ha..."
CH8_Main_11_028,"I showed some of my dragon nature to provoke the Draconics."
CH8_Main_11_029,"It wasn't as strong as when I'm in a dragon form, but I released it just enough for them to lose their reason."
CH8_Main_11_030,"I wasn't able to control my power completely, though."
CH8_Main_11_031,"And I spoke like my old self... Hahaha. Sorry for showing you that."
CH8_Main_11_032,"Ahahaha...."
CH8_Main_12_001,"Northwest Dwarf ruins... Enemy... found."
CH8_Main_12_002,"Five humans including the wielder of the Holy Sword... One Dwarf... One dragon."
CH8_Main_12_003,"Dragon... cannot be captured..."
CH8_Main_12_004,"Hmph. Weakling."
CH8_Main_12_005,"So the ruins in the northwest."
CH8_Main_12_006,"So they want to use the traps set by the Dwarves to stop ground forces, and to keep away the Draconics."
CH8_Main_12_007,"I can see through it. Bweh heh... They are all weaklings anyway, except for the Priestess of Water."
CH8_Main_12_008,"Dragons wouldn't kill each other so easily."
CH8_Main_12_009,"Go, Temeraire! Go on a rampage, kill them, and destroy everything!!"
CH8_Main_12_010,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_13_001,"Hm... I thought they would send some Draconics a few times at least..."
CH8_Main_13_002,"But they sent Temeraire right away."
CH8_Main_13_003,"Infira really likes to use overwhelming force."
CH8_Main_13_004,"Yanne, you have the location?"
CH8_Main_13_005,"Yes, I've arrived."
CH8_Main_13_006,"I can shoot anytime!"
CH8_Main_13_007,"Okay, we're counting on you."
CH8_Main_13_008,"Now, let's make an opening for Yanne to shoot!"
CH8_Main_14_001,"Now, Yanne!"
CH8_Main_14_002,"Leave it to me!"
CH8_Main_14_003,"Take this!!"
CH8_Main_14_004,"*Huff...* Did we succeed?"
CH8_Main_14_005,"*Coughs* I'm not sure yet."
CH8_Main_14_006,"Don't let your guard down!"
CH8_Main_14_007,"Temeraire..."
CH8_Main_14_008,"Temeraire, my old friend."
CH8_Main_14_009,"You've lost all reason, and even your soul is filled with anger and madness."
CH8_Main_14_010,"But it's okay. Just go to sleep now."
CH8_Main_14_011,"Once you rest for a long time... Everything will be better..."
CH8_Main_14_012,"…."
CH8_Main_14_013,"Bweh heh heh... Bwahahaha!!"
CH8_Main_14_014,"Found you, Laias!"
CH8_Main_14_015,"..?!"
CH8_Main_14_016,"Y-you're..."
CH8_Main_14_017,"You're not Temeraire."
CH8_Main_14_018,"Bweh heh heh, you got half the answer right."
CH8_Main_14_019,"This is the body of your old friend, Temeraire."
CH8_Main_14_020,"But its mind is under my control!"
CH8_Main_14_021,"Infira..."
CH8_Main_14_022,"It was you."
CH8_Main_14_023,"Ha ha, the great Blue Dragon knows me. What an honor."
CH8_Main_14_024,"Oh. I did fight your siblings."
CH8_Main_14_025,"I could've killed Neraxis last time, but I didn't get to."
CH8_Main_14_026,"Bwahahaha!"
CH8_Main_14_027,"You're using a curse to control his mind..."
CH8_Main_14_028,"Hm. I have no other choice."
CH8_Main_14_029,"Hm? Hey!"
CH8_Main_14_030,"Hey! Wait! Don't ignore me!"
CH8_Main_14_031,"Hey!!!!"
CH8_Main_14_032,"Yanne. We'll have to change plans."
CH8_Main_14_033,"Could you regroup with us?"
CH8_Main_14_034,"Okay. I'll be there!"
CH8_Main_14_035,"The purging didn't work?"
CH8_Main_14_036,"It worked... But it wasn't regular mind control."
CH8_Main_14_037,"He was using a curse to directly take his mind and take over his body."
CH8_Main_14_038,"A curse!?"
CH8_Main_14_039,"I'm not sure how Infira gained that power..."
CH8_Main_14_040,"But we'll have to immobilize Temeraire now."
CH8_Main_14_041,"Everyone, do your best!"
CH8_Main_14_042,"Kuh, you dare ignore me!?"
CH8_Main_14_043,"Don't think you'll die without suffering first, trash!"
CH8_Main_14_044,"Trample them, Temeraire!"
CH8_Main_14_045,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_15_001,"Kuh, the heat from the breath...!"
CH8_Main_15_002,"We have to endure it!"
CH8_Main_15_003,"Fortunately, we have Laias's magic,"
CH8_Main_15_004,"but we won't last long...!"
CH8_Main_15_005,"Again, again, again!"
CH8_Main_15_006,"Why is everyone here resistant to fire!?"
CH8_Main_15_007,"My magic isn't working!!"
CH8_Main_15_008,"Well, it's a volcano... and it's the Red Dragon, so isn't it obvious?"
CH8_Main_15_009,"I know, Roi, you idiot!!"
CH8_Main_15_010,"It's not like you're doing much, either, Roi!"
CH8_Main_15_011,"Well, my dagger'll do nothing to that big body."
CH8_Main_15_012,"But I can keep the rocks and boulders from hitting you."
CH8_Main_15_013,"Yaaah! I'm mad, too! I wanna do something!"
CH8_Main_15_014,"If it wasn't for Laias's shield and Pavel's frost, it would've been dangerous."
CH8_Main_15_015,"Anyway, the only ones who can even hurt that monster are..."
CH8_Main_15_016,"Yanne and Laias."
CH8_Main_15_017,"Laias, you won't turn into a dragon?"
CH8_Main_15_018,"If I turn into a dragon in a place like this, you'll be in danger too."
CH8_Main_15_019,"I think it will be safer if I fight in this form."
CH8_Main_15_020,"But I don't think we'll be able to defeat him like this."
CH8_Main_15_021,"…."
CH8_Main_15_022,"Alright, I have an idea."
CH8_Main_15_023,"It's a gamble, though...!"
CH8_Main_16_001,"Kuh! This is a dragon... Every attack from it is just too strong!"
CH8_Main_16_002,"The shield is reaching its limit, too...!"
CH8_Main_16_003,"Just a bit more!"
CH8_Main_16_004,"We just have to lure him over there!"
CH8_Main_16_005,"The volcano monsters are in the way!"
CH8_Main_16_006,"Wow, a lava golem!"
CH8_Main_16_007,"Roi..."
CH8_Main_16_008,"This isn't the time, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_16_009,"I'll bust through them! Haaa!"
CH8_Main_16_010,"Bwahahaha, there's no use in resisting!"
CH8_Main_16_011,"No matter what you do, you can't win against me!!"
CH8_Main_16_012,"If you want to win, you should reveal your true dragon form!!"
CH8_Main_16_013,"And then, the humans around you will all die."
CH8_Main_16_014,"Bwa ha ha ha!!!"
CH8_Main_17_001,"Alright. Now!"
CH8_Main_17_002,"Everyone, get down and be careful!"
CH8_Main_17_003,"Bwahahaha, this is all you could come up with?"
CH8_Main_17_004,"There's no way the arrows of a Dwarf would penetrate Temeraire's scales!"
CH8_Main_17_005,"…"
CH8_Main_17_006,"Hm? Where's Laias...!?"
CH8_Main_17_007,"Get off."
CH8_Main_17_008,"Kyaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_17_009,"Kuh. Was the trap a fake...?"
CH8_Main_17_010,"Hmpf, this attack doesn't even hurt... Hm?"
CH8_Main_17_011,"That's the signal. Do it, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_17_012,"Finally... Finally it's time for this archmage to shine!"
CH8_Main_17_013,"I'll bury you, you red lizard!!!"
CH8_Main_17_014,"Kwaaaah!?"
CH8_Main_17_015,"Ignorant buffoons! What are you doing!?"
CH8_Main_17_016,"Ha ha, these ruins were made by ancient Dwarves."
CH8_Main_17_017,"They carved out a mountain and set up all these traps and devices."
CH8_Main_17_018,"But if none of the traps work..."
CH8_Main_17_019,"There's this left."
CH8_Main_17_020,"Kuh, I'll kill you, you little cretin!"
CH8_Main_17_021,"All I have to do is get away...!"
CH8_Main_17_022,"Impossible. As long as your wings and body are under that many rocks,"
CH8_Main_17_023,"not even a dragon will be able to leave easily."
CH8_Main_17_024,"Hmph. Don't make me laugh!!!!"
CH8_Main_17_025,"Kuh, this is!?"
CH8_Main_17_026,"You melted the rocks...!"
CH8_Main_17_027,"You think you can stop me with this!?"
CH8_Main_17_028,"I'll kill you first, pipsqueak!"
CH8_Main_17_029,"We don't have time. We need to remove the curse now!"
CH8_Main_17_030,"The Holy Sword should be able to do that."
CH8_Main_17_031,"But getting near Temeraire while he's like that is...!"
CH8_Main_17_032,"…"
CH8_Main_17_033,"No, Kasel! It's too dangerous!"
CH8_Main_17_034,"But if I don't do it...!"
CH8_Main_17_035,"Kasel, that sword..."
CH8_Main_17_036,"Will its power work even if it's away from you?"
CH8_Main_17_037,"What? Oh, I never tried, but...!"
CH8_Main_17_038,"Alright. Let's give it a try!"
CH8_Main_17_039,"Come here!"
CH8_Main_17_040,"Now, take a deep breath, and pull the string."
CH8_Main_17_041,"Kasel: Hrgh...! This bow...!"
CH8_Main_17_042,"Kasel: So heavy... And the string is so tight..."
CH8_Main_17_043,"Kasel: Yanne, you wielded something like this so easily...!"
CH8_Main_17_044,"Yanne: Hahaha. Well, if anything, I have confidence in my strength."
CH8_Main_17_045,"Yanne: Don't think about anything else. Focus on the Holy Sword, and control its power."
CH8_Main_17_046,"Yanne: I'll help you with the aiming and shooting."
CH8_Main_17_047,"Focus... Focus..."
CH8_Main_17_048,"Holy Sword... Goddess..."
CH8_Main_17_049,"Grant me the power to get through this...!"
CH8_Main_17_050,"Kasel: Now, Yanne!"
CH8_Main_17_051,"Yanne: Alright! Fire----!!!!"
CH8_Main_17_052,"Kwaaa!!! Die, you trash!"
CH8_Main_17_053,"Gugh!?"
CH8_Main_17_054,"This is... the Holy Sword!"
CH8_Main_17_055,"No! My power... The power that he gave me...!!!"
CH8_Main_17_056,"Kwaaahhh!!!"
CH8_Main_18_001,"It's finally over... *Sigh.* That fight was just too much."
CH8_Main_18_002,"I didn't think he would be able to move under that pile of rocks..."
CH8_Main_18_003,"By the way, Yanne. It was a great idea to use the Holy Sword like an arrow."
CH8_Main_18_004,"Hahaha. Well, it's not the first time I did it."
CH8_Main_18_005,"I've used swords and spears to shoot with my bow before."
CH8_Main_18_006,"Well, they don't fly as well as arrows..."
CH8_Main_18_007,"Maybe because it's the Holy Sword? It felt different from when I shoot a regular sword."
CH8_Main_18_008,"Hahaha... I'm glad no one's seriously hurt."
CH8_Main_18_009,"It's because you protected us from the front, Phillop."
CH8_Main_18_010,"Hahaha, thanks for saying that."
CH8_Main_18_011,"Frey, Frey, did you watch me fight?"
CH8_Main_18_012,"I did well, huh!? Didn't I?"
CH8_Main_18_013,"Yes, Cleo. You were great."
CH8_Main_18_014,"You get so big-headed... Hahaha."
CH8_Main_18_015,"You felt so down because your attacks weren't working earlier."
CH8_Main_18_016,"Wh-who said I was down!?"
CH8_Main_18_017,"Eek! Idiot! That idiot, Roi!"
CH8_Main_18_018,"Hey, that hurts. C'mon, don't hit me."
CH8_Main_18_019,"We succeeded in making Temeraire fall asleep."
CH8_Main_18_020,"It won't last long since it's an artificial slumber, though..."
CH8_Main_18_021,"As long as no one wakes him up, he will sleep for over 10 years."
CH8_Main_18_022,"Hahaha... 10 years..."
CH8_Main_18_023,"Kasel, did you find the Holy Sword?"
CH8_Main_18_024,"Oh, yes. Actually..."
CH8_Main_18_025,"When I went to Temeraire to look for the Holy Sword,"
CH8_Main_18_026,"it appeared in front of me from the sky."
CH8_Main_18_027,"Just like when it first came to me..."
CH8_Main_18_028,"Oh, how interesting."
CH8_Main_18_029,"I guess that's proof that you were chosen as the master of the Holy Sword?"
CH8_Main_18_030,"I heard that the Holy Sword goes back to its master, no matter where it is."
CH8_Main_18_031,"Hm. So even if Kasel returned the Holy Sword to the palace..."
CH8_Main_18_032,"It would have returned to him, anyway."
CH8_Main_18_033,"Oh. Ahahaha... Maybe."
CH8_Main_18_034,"I feel stupid for worrying about all those things in the past."
CH8_Main_18_035,"Ha ha, isn't that proof that you've grown, Kasel?"
CH8_Main_18_036,"Hahaha, maybe. Thanks, Frey."
CH8_Main_18_037,"We'll have to decide what to do next."
CH8_Main_18_038,"We took care of Temeraire, and we retrieved the Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_18_039,"Now, are we heading to the volcano?"
CH8_Main_18_040,"Hm... I'm concerned about what Infira said about 'him.'"
CH8_Main_18_041,"We might find out whether Balalaika and Malduk were talking about the same one, the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_18_042,"Wasn't the goal to gather information?"
CH8_Main_18_043,"We might be able to find out the details if we go to the volcano."
CH8_Main_18_044,"It's decided, then."
CH8_Main_18_045,"We don't know when the Draconics will come, so let's get moving."
CH8_Main_18_046,"Hm. Sorry, but I'll stay here."
CH8_Main_18_047,"Huh? Why?"
CH8_Main_18_048,"It will be very bad if the Draconics come here to wake up Temeraire and try to control him again."
CH8_Main_18_049,"Someone must say here to protect it."
CH8_Main_18_050,"Like I said, there are many caves here that lead to the Dwarven Kingdom."
CH8_Main_18_051,"If we set up some bases here by calling the Dwarven army, we should be able to stop those Draconics."
CH8_Main_18_052,"As long as Temeraire is not awakened that is."
CH8_Main_18_053,"I see..."
CH8_Main_18_054,"Thank you, Phillop."
CH8_Main_18_055,"Bwahaha, what's there to thank me for?"
CH8_Main_18_056,"Now, get moving. We'll meet again."
CH8_Main_19_001,"Kwaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_19_002,"Those filthy bastards dared to...!"
CH8_Main_19_003,"Form an army and take back Temeraire!!!"
CH8_Main_19_004,"If you don't retrieve him by tomorrow, you are all dead!!!"
CH8_Main_19_005,"Hmph. How unsightly, Infira."
CH8_Main_19_006,"It's your fault that you lost Temeraire."
CH8_Main_19_007,"Don't take it out on your pawns, and think of how you'll make up for your mistake."
CH8_Main_19_008,"Damn it, I don't need your advice!"
CH8_Main_19_009,"I'll kill him..."
CH8_Main_19_010,"That warrior of the Holy Sword...!"
CH8_Main_19_011,"Hmph. That's all you're worth, in the end."
CH8_Main_19_012,"By the way, I'm interested now..."
CH8_Main_19_013,"To find out how much the Warrior of the Holy Sword has grown..."
CH8_Main_20_001,"That's...!"
CH8_Main_20_002,"Morrah."
CH8_Main_20_003,"Heh. It's been a while."
CH8_Main_20_004,"I heard you had some unique comrades with you."
CH8_Main_20_005,"It's been a while, Priestess of the Flow."
CH8_Main_20_006,"Draconic Commander, Morrah."
CH8_Main_20_007,"Heh, I've left that position behind a long time ago."
CH8_Main_20_008,"Infira took over, but he's not reliable."
CH8_Main_20_009,"I'm just a knight loyal to Maria."
CH8_Main_20_010,"You are not with Infira?"
CH8_Main_20_011,"Hmph. I don't care about small fry like him."
CH8_Main_20_012,"Demons don't care about things like loyalty to their own race."
CH8_Main_20_013,"I only carry out my missions."
CH8_Main_20_014,"You don't sound like a monster that took the lives of countless dragons."
CH8_Main_20_015,"What happened to your violent self?"
CH8_Main_20_016,"Do I have to answer that?"
CH8_Main_20_017,"Fine."
CH8_Main_20_018,"The reason why I came here today is..."
CH8_Main_20_019,"Him, actually."
CH8_Main_20_020,"What is it?"
CH8_Main_20_021,"We've already fought twice, human. Don't be so cold."
CH8_Main_20_022,"Didn't Maria tell you?"
CH8_Main_20_023,"You can't die yet."
CH8_Main_20_024,"…?"
CH8_Main_20_025,"If you are still at the same level as last time, you'll die in the near future."
CH8_Main_20_026,"That's why I'll be testing you to see how much you've grown."
CH8_Main_20_027,"If you want, you can all come at me."
CH8_Main_20_028,"Don't worry, I won't kill you."
CH8_Main_20_029,"I'm not worried."
CH8_Main_20_030,"If you want to test me... I'll fight alone."
CH8_Main_20_031,"But..."
CH8_Main_20_032,"Will you be okay, Kasel?"
CH8_Main_20_033,"I'll be alright, Frey."
CH8_Main_20_034,"She's had plenty of chances to kill us, but she hasn't taken them."
CH8_Main_20_035,"I'm sure there's a meaning to this."
CH8_Main_20_036,"Then- takes this, Morrah!!"
CH8_Main_20_037,"Come, Warrior of the Holy Sword!"
CH8_Main_20_038,"Prove your strength to me!"
CH8_Main_21_001,"Phew... You sure got stronger."
CH8_Main_21_002,"The power of the Holy Sword is almost complete, too."
CH8_Main_21_003,"That was a little fun."
CH8_Main_21_004,"Even with that Holy Power..."
CH8_Main_21_005,"She seems stronger than last time...!"
CH8_Main_21_006,"I did have a hard time controlling my power since you guys got stronger."
CH8_Main_21_007,"After all, I can't have the owner of the Holy Sword die so easily."
CH8_Main_21_008,"…"
CH8_Main_21_009,"I have... a question."
CH8_Main_21_010,"Well, go ahead."
CH8_Main_21_011,"What are you and Maria trying to do?"
CH8_Main_21_012,"Are you part of the Dark Force? Or..."
CH8_Main_21_013,"…"
CH8_Main_21_014,"I can't answer that."
CH8_Main_21_015,"I'll tell you this, though."
CH8_Main_21_016,"You are not strong enough yet."
CH8_Main_21_017,"If you don't get stronger..."
CH8_Main_21_018,"You'll definitely die."
CH8_Main_21_019,"Strengthen your own self, not just the Holy Sword's power."
CH8_Main_21_020,"You'll need to do that If you want to fight him... the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_22_001,"So, it was the Black Knight..."
CH8_Main_22_002,"What do you think his goal is?"
CH8_Main_22_003,"Going around the continent doing this..."
CH8_Main_22_004,"Hm... I'm not sure, either."
CH8_Main_22_005,"No one knows the Dark Force's real goal."
CH8_Main_22_006,"All we know is that the Dark Lord Angmund tried to annihilate all living things in the material world,"
CH8_Main_22_007,"but the reason behind his actions is all a mystery."
CH8_Main_22_008,"I don't think this is the time to worry about that."
CH8_Main_22_009,"We have something more urgent to worry about."
CH8_Main_23_001,"What happened just now... Something wasn't right."
CH8_Main_23_002,"What do you mean?"
CH8_Main_23_003,"The battle just now was too easy."
CH8_Main_23_004,"Even if we're getting used to fighting the Draconics,"
CH8_Main_23_005,"now that Phillop is out, the battle shouldn't have been this easy..."
CH8_Main_23_006,"I think we're being lured into a trap."
CH8_Main_23_007,"Why do you think that?"
CH8_Main_23_008,"It's a method used when hunting."
CH8_Main_23_009,"When hunting aggressive prey,"
CH8_Main_23_010,"it's easy to lure it into a trap after provoking it a little."
CH8_Main_23_011,"Then, shouldn't we not follow them?"
CH8_Main_23_012,"It would be good if that was possible..."
CH8_Main_23_013,"This is the only way to the volcano, though."
CH8_Main_23_014,"We'll just have to be careful."
CH8_Main_24_001,"Running away again? How far will they lure us in..."
CH8_Main_24_002,"Now it's past the lava river..."
CH8_Main_24_003,"I think there's a path that leads to the top of the volcano to the northeast."
CH8_Main_24_004,"Can't we go up that way?"
CH8_Main_24_005,"There's a cursed castle gate that the Demons made there."
CH8_Main_24_006,"As long as the Draconics are guarding it, no one outside the Dark Force can get past."
CH8_Main_24_007,"I could transform into a dragon and fly over it,"
CH8_Main_24_008,"but the Draconics will go berserk and come at us. It's too dangerous to risk."
CH8_Main_24_009,"We'll have to follow the Draconics that ran away."
CH8_Main_24_010,"I don't like it. Walking right into an obvious trap..."
CH8_Main_25_001,"Hm!? That's..."
CH8_Main_25_002,"A middle class Demon... They look like the Demons that came from the Pandemonium a hundred years ago."
CH8_Main_25_003,"Hm, they're blocking the way. Are they like gatekeepers...?"
CH8_Main_25_004,"Behind us! Watch out!"
CH8_Main_25_005,"Ugh!? The Draconics are attacking all at once...!"
CH8_Main_25_006,"In the name of the Goddess...!"
CH8_Main_25_007,"Watch out! The shield won't last long...!"
CH8_Main_26_001,"There's no end to them...!"
CH8_Main_26_002,"Do they plan on just killing us here...!"
CH8_Main_26_003,"Hm!? That's..."
CH8_Main_26_004,"Tsk. So nasty. Those over there look more delicious."
CH8_Main_26_005,"Stop eating, seriously."
CH8_Main_26_006,"Is that all you think about?"
CH8_Main_26_007,"Huh? What's more important than eating?"
CH8_Main_26_008,"By the way, where is your dad?"
CH8_Main_26_009,"I want to eat him."
CH8_Main_26_010,"Don't push it. I'm the one who wants to kill that trash the most."
CH8_Main_26_011,"Hey. Everyone's looking. Stop eating."
CH8_Main_26_012,"You always just keep eating, even when it's really bad."
CH8_Main_26_013,"I was hungry. What can I do?"
CH8_Main_26_014,"Hello. I don't eat humans, so they don't have to worry."
CH8_Main_26_015,"And I don't like the souls of dragons."
CH8_Main_26_016,"I like eating Demons, though."
CH8_Main_26_017,"You're talking about eating again!"
CH8_Main_26_018,"What about it!?"
CH8_Main_26_019,"Go over there and eat those stupid Draconics!"
CH8_Main_26_020,"I will!"
CH8_Main_26_021,"&%$#!?&%$#!?"
CH8_Main_26_022,"….???"
CH8_Main_26_023,"Who were they?"
CH8_Main_26_024,"I'm not sure..."
CH8_Main_26_025,"The girl definitely looks like a Demon..."
CH8_Main_26_026,"The guy doesn't look like it..."
CH8_Main_26_027,"A Demon possessing a human body, and..."
CH8_Main_26_028,"I didn't think I would see something so interesting."
CH8_Main_26_029,"A half-human half-Demon born between a human and a Demon..."
CH8_Main_26_030,"A half-human half-Demon!?"
CH8_Main_26_031,"That's the discovery of the century!"
CH8_Main_26_032,"Alright. Let's bet on who can kill more!"
CH8_Main_26_033,"Geh heh heh, another obvious bet."
CH8_Main_26_034,"Of course, I'll kill more than a half breed like you!"
CH8_Main_26_035,"Don't make me laugh, crab-legs!"
CH8_Main_26_036,"I won last time, alright!?"
CH8_Main_26_037,"No, you didn't!"
CH8_Main_26_038,"Stop fooling around!!!"
CH8_Main_27_001,"Hm, thank you for helping..."
CH8_Main_27_002,"But we don't know your names yet."
CH8_Main_27_003,"Hm? Name?"
CH8_Main_27_004,"You're asking for a Demon's name? What a strange human."
CH8_Main_27_005,"I'm Viska. I'm the future Dark Lord."
CH8_Main_27_006,"Oh, and this beanpole is Ezekiel."
CH8_Main_27_007,"Future Dark Lord!?"
CH8_Main_27_008,"See, they're surprised."
CH8_Main_27_009,"It's not like she's a descendant of the Dark Lord or anything."
CH8_Main_27_010,"Just an idiot who only wants to get stronger."
CH8_Main_27_011,"Idiot? How rude."
CH8_Main_27_012,"Oh, and I like fine food."
CH8_Main_27_013,"There's nothing better than the soul of a strong Demon, though."
CH8_Main_27_014,"The souls of these Draconics are pretty good, too... Heh heh heh heh."
CH8_Main_27_015,"(Oh... We might be able to use her.)"
CH8_Main_27_016,"Thanks for helping, but..."
CH8_Main_27_017,"That body is originally a human's..."
CH8_Main_27_018,"Hm? Oh, don't worry. It was a fair contract. I didn't steal it."
CH8_Main_27_019,"If it weren't for me, this girl would have died a long time ago."
CH8_Main_27_020,"…"
CH8_Main_27_021,"I think I heard something about a half-human half-Demon..."
CH8_Main_27_022,"Hm... Well, it's something like that."
CH8_Main_27_023,"So what? You got a problem?"
CH8_Main_27_024,"The existence of Half-human half-Demons have never been confirmed in any of my books!"
CH8_Main_27_025,"Of course, I'm curious as a wizard!"
CH8_Main_27_026,"Tsk. Another annoying hassle."
CH8_Main_27_027,"What brings you two here...?"
CH8_Main_27_028,"Oh, I want to kill that Malduk."
CH8_Main_27_029,"I was going to go across the desert to the swamps of Gargoss..."
CH8_Main_27_030,"But then I saw the Dark Force moving."
CH8_Main_27_031,"M-Malduk!?"
CH8_Main_27_032,"Hm, so it was after we met..."
CH8_Main_27_033,"So I was going around killing strong Demons, and that's when I saw him."
CH8_Main_27_034,"Oh, I was looking around for a Succubus..."
CH8_Main_27_035,"And then, she just attacked me."
CH8_Main_27_036,"Well, I stopped fighting after I found out he was a half breed."
CH8_Main_27_037,"I didn't think he would taste good, anyway."
CH8_Main_27_038,"I won last time we fought, alright!?"
CH8_Main_27_039,"No, you didn't!"
CH8_Main_27_040,"Anyway. It looked like the Succubus flew this way."
CH8_Main_27_041,"So, I was heading to the volcano after the fight, and she followed me."
CH8_Main_27_042,"I'm interested in that Succubus..."
CH8_Main_27_043,"And something smells delicious near the volcano."
CH8_Main_27_044,"Hey, don't try to eat the Succubus."
CH8_Main_27_045,"I promised Theo."
CH8_Main_27_046,"Though I don't care if you eat any Draconics."
CH8_Main_27_047,"Hm? Oh, I'll think about it."
CH8_Main_27_048,"Who knows? Maybe there's a powerful Demon in the volcano that will satisfy my cravings."
CH8_Main_27_049,"You eat the souls of Demons, right?"
CH8_Main_27_050,"At the top of the volcano, there's a powerful Draconic named Infira."
CH8_Main_27_051,"You might get to meet him if you come with us."
CH8_Main_27_052,"Really!?"
CH8_Main_27_053,"Kukuku... Keke... I like you."
CH8_Main_27_054,"Alright, I'm coming! His soul is mine, though, okay?"
CH8_Main_27_055,"Tsk. Bothersome."
CH8_Main_27_056,"Well, we might as well end this."
CH8_Main_27_057,"Roi... What are you planning?"
CH8_Main_28_001,"Kahahaha, I'll cut you to pieces!!!"
CH8_Main_28_002,"Die! Die! Die!!!"
CH8_Main_28_003,"Goddess..."
CH8_Main_28_004,"Hm, they really fight well."
CH8_Main_28_005,"Maybe because they are Demons... They got incredibly powerful charges."
CH8_Main_28_006,"That's why the Draconics can't do anything about it."
CH8_Main_28_007,"They don't have time to strategize..."
CH8_Main_28_008,"They really fight well, but..."
CH8_Main_28_009,"Roi, will it be okay?"
CH8_Main_28_010,"They are Demons, but they are not all evil."
CH8_Main_28_011,"It was the same with Epis. She just did whatever pleased her."
CH8_Main_28_012,"Likewise, Viska has her own goal."
CH8_Main_28_013,"And Ezekiel... He said he made a promise to Theo."
CH8_Main_28_014,"We could say that he's loyal."
CH8_Main_28_015,"Hahaha, you like analyzing people?"
CH8_Main_28_016,"It was just a skill I needed in my old work."
CH8_Main_28_017,"I'm pretty confident in my ability to read people."
CH8_Main_28_018,"But they are Demons."
CH8_Main_28_019,"Well, that's true."
CH8_Main_28_020,"Hm? What? What's going on?"
CH8_Main_28_021,"Were you eating something good without me?"
CH8_Main_28_022,"Don't be like that!"
CH8_Main_28_023,"Hahaha, it's not that."
CH8_Main_28_024,"If you're hungry, I made a snack with monster meat..."
CH8_Main_28_025,"Snack!!!"
CH8_Main_28_026,"You fight like crazy beast,"
CH8_Main_28_027,"and you act like that when someone feeds you?"
CH8_Main_28_028,"Ahaha...."
CH8_Main_28_029,"There are all kinds of Demons, I guess."
CH8_Main_28_030,"I met a Demon named Epis before, and she was similar..."
CH8_Main_28_031,"Huh? You know Epis?"
CH8_Main_28_032,"The Succubus I'm looking for is her."
CH8_Main_28_033,"When did you see her? Where?"
CH8_Main_28_034,"Huh? Oh, I saw Epis a while ago."
CH8_Main_28_035,"The last time was at Galluah Plains..."
CH8_Main_28_036,"Well, if you didn't see her recently, you must not know where she is now."
CH8_Main_28_037,"Tsk. I got excited for nothing."
CH8_Main_28_038,"You said you made a promise to Theo, right? Who is he?"
CH8_Main_28_039,"Oh... It's hard to explain."
CH8_Main_28_040,"In short, he's an idiotic human."
CH8_Main_28_041,"He's staying in Aegina to help other people fight Demons."
CH8_Main_28_042,"He said he's a knight of the Republic of Gray, and that he can't just let people suffer..."
CH8_Main_28_043,"Ugh. That's why he couldn't even do what he wanted for the past 10 years."
CH8_Main_28_044,"He can't be left alone, seriously."
CH8_Main_28_045,"Ha ha. He's helping the people of the desert while I'm not there... I'm grateful for that."
CH8_Main_28_046,"I'll have to go thank him later."
CH8_Main_28_047,"Gray? I've heard that name before..."
CH8_Main_28_048,"Oh! That's the Republic of Gray that Epis spoke about!"
CH8_Main_28_049,"Didn't the Republic of Gray fall 100 years ago?"
CH8_Main_28_050,"He's not an Undead, is he? Like Jane..."
CH8_Main_29_001,"*Huff... Huff…*"
CH8_Main_29_002,"The number of Draconics is increasing."
CH8_Main_29_003,"It feels harder to get through their defense..."
CH8_Main_29_004,"Hey, you're tired already?"
CH8_Main_29_005,"So pathetic. You call yourself the Warrior of the Holy Sword?"
CH8_Main_29_006,"I heard a warrior in the past even defeated Angmund?"
CH8_Main_29_007,"Thanks to that, my plan to eat the Dark Lord and become the new Dark Lord failed."
CH8_Main_29_008,"But shouldn't you have at least that much power if you're a warrior?"
CH8_Main_29_009,"It's strange hearing that from a Demon."
CH8_Main_29_010,"I can't say anything about it, though. It's true that I'm not strong enough..."
CH8_Main_29_011,"I'll have to try harder to get stronger."
CH8_Main_29_012,"If you have the will to get stronger, that's enough."
CH8_Main_29_013,"It's better to acknowledge your weakness and try to get stronger,"
CH8_Main_29_014,"than act strong when you are really weak."
CH8_Main_29_015,"Hmm... Never thought I'd hear you say something like that."
CH8_Main_29_016,"Tsk. Come on. Who do you think I am?"
CH8_Main_29_017,"A fatty idiot beast."
CH8_Main_29_018,"I'll eat you first, then!"
CH8_Main_29_019,"Hahaha, you two seem so close."
CH8_Main_29_020,"Right, Frey?"
CH8_Main_29_021,"Yes. It's like watching Cleo and Roi..."
CH8_Main_29_022,"What part of it!!!"
CH8_Main_30_001,"It's the way up to the Dragia Volcano now..."
CH8_Main_30_002,"The top of the volcano used to be Temeraire's nest."
CH8_Main_30_003,"Now it's been occupied by the Draconics and has become their castle..."
CH8_Main_30_004,"Are you sure this way up is safer than the other ways?"
CH8_Main_30_005,"Yes. There's nothing on the terrain that the Draconics could use strategically."
CH8_Main_30_006,"It's also the only way through the ground to go up the mountain."
CH8_Main_30_007,"It won't be easy to go up."
CH8_Main_30_008,"Since they'll be waiting for us up there..."
CH8_Main_30_009,"Heh heh heh, no matter. I'll just eat them all."
CH8_Main_30_010,"This time will be a real feast!"
CH8_Main_31_001,"You dare come to your own tomb, warrior!?"
CH8_Main_31_002,"Infira...!"
CH8_Main_31_003,"You dared to ruin my plans!"
CH8_Main_31_004,"Before you die, you'll experience true pain!"
CH8_Main_31_005,"Ha, come on."
CH8_Main_31_006,"Is talking all you can do?"
CH8_Main_31_007,"How about you shut up and come at me?"
CH8_Main_31_008,"A Demon? Why is a Demon with the humans...!?"
CH8_Main_31_009,"Heh heh, with the humans?"
CH8_Main_31_010,"I just don't like you all."
CH8_Main_31_011,"I don't care about the weak residents of the material world."
CH8_Main_31_012,"Live or die, they can do whatever they want to."
CH8_Main_31_013,"I just want to eat you all! Gah hah hah!"
CH8_Main_31_014,"I knew I sent enough soldiers to kill all those humans,"
CH8_Main_31_015,"and I thought it was weird when I didn't hear back..."
CH8_Main_31_016,"So, it was you!"
CH8_Main_31_017,"Oh, you sent them?"
CH8_Main_31_018,"You were all so delicious. It was a feast!"
CH8_Main_31_019,"How about you let me eat you, too? Heh heh heh!"
CH8_Main_31_020,"Hah! You fools just can't see the big picture!"
CH8_Main_31_021,"I don't care if it's humans, dragons, or Demons!"
CH8_Main_31_022,"I'll get rid of anyone who gets in the way!"
CH8_Main_31_023,"Left Unit, you kill those two Demons!"
CH8_Main_31_024,"Subdue them! Don't let them get away!"
CH8_Main_31_025,"Right Unit, you kill the warrior and the others!"
CH8_Main_31_026,"If you don't, you'll die by my hands!"
CH8_Main_32_001,"Infira: Damn, damn, damn!"
CH8_Main_32_002,"Infira: Idiots! You couldn't even kill a single one--!!!"
CH8_Main_32_003,"Heh heh, this is fun."
CH8_Main_32_004,"It's time to binge!"
CH8_Main_32_005,"I'll eat every single one of you!!"
CH8_Main_32_006,"Gwa ha ha, don't get a stomachache!"
CH8_Main_32_007,"You'll eat their leader over there, too, won't you!?"
CH8_Main_32_008,"Isn't it obvious? Kyahaha!"
CH8_Main_32_009,"No more playing around!"
CH8_Main_32_010,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_32_011,"Kuh, none of you can kill the warrior? Even the small fries backing him up are still alive!?"
CH8_Main_32_012,"Move, you trash!"
CH8_Main_32_013,"I'll do it myself!"
CH8_Main_33_001,"Kuh!"
CH8_Main_33_002,"You filthy bastards dared to...!"
CH8_Main_33_003,"You think I'll fall for those stupid attacks!?"
CH8_Main_33_004,"You're still talking like that, even though you're getting wrecked!?"
CH8_Main_33_005,"Hmph. Your attacks can't even tickle me!"
CH8_Main_33_006,"And you! You dare attack me with those lowly fire attacks? Are you stupid!?"
CH8_Main_33_007,"What did you say!?"
CH8_Main_33_008,"Don't fall for it, Cleo!"
CH8_Main_33_009,"He's just bluffing, now that he's losing!"
CH8_Main_33_010,"Kwaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_33_011,"No way! I can't end like this!"
CH8_Main_33_012,"I have no other choice...!!!"
CH8_Main_33_013,"?!!"
CH8_Main_33_014,"His own pawns...!?"
CH8_Main_33_015,"Die, you trash!"
CH8_Main_33_016,"Give me all your power!!"
CH8_Main_33_017,"This is bad. We have to stop him...!"
CH8_Main_33_018,"What is going on?"
CH8_Main_33_019,"He's about to go berserk!"
CH8_Main_33_020,"If we don't stop him...!"
CH8_Main_33_021,"Too late, trash!!!"
CH8_Main_33_022,"Kwaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_33_023,"Alright. Everyone, move away!"
CH8_Main_33_024,"I'm worried that the remaining Draconics will also go berserk... But this is the only way...!"
CH8_Main_33_025,"Infira: Graaaagh!!!"
CH8_Main_33_026,"Infira: Die, dragon!!!"
CH8_Main_33_027,"Laias: ...Fake Dragon."
CH8_Main_33_028,"Laias: The power that you gained by killing my kin - "
CH8_Main_33_029,"Laias: It is time to return it to the flow of the world!!"
CH8_Main_33_030,"Infira: Kukuku, don't make me laugh!"
CH8_Main_33_031,"Infira: I'll absorb the last of the power from the Draconics in this area."
CH8_Main_33_032,"Infira: Then I'll bite your neck off,"
CH8_Main_33_033,"Infira: and trample the rest of you - !!!!"
CH8_Main_33_034,"Kuh, this is crazy...!"
CH8_Main_33_035,"This is how dragons fight...!"
CH8_Main_33_036,"Kyah! Won't we be crushed if this continues!?"
CH8_Main_33_037,"What about the other Draconics?"
CH8_Main_33_038,"Tsk. Their souls were taken."
CH8_Main_33_039,"Was it Infira? He used the souls of his kin to get more power..."
CH8_Main_33_040,"How funny. He has a power similar to mine..."
CH8_Main_33_041,"At least we don't have to worry about the other Draconics going berserk...!"
CH8_Main_33_042,"Isn't Laias losing?"
CH8_Main_33_043,"Infira: Gah hah hah hah! You're just a Blue Dragon, after all!"
CH8_Main_33_044,"Infira: Your combat power is lower than a Red or Black Dragon's!"
CH8_Main_33_045,"Infira: Right now, I'm even stronger than Temeraire or Armarta in their prime…!!"
CH8_Main_33_046,"Infira: No, I could kill just about any dragon now!!!"
CH8_Main_33_047,"Laias: Kuh... With just raw power, I can't...!"
CH8_Main_33_048,"This is bad! Laias alone can't do it!"
CH8_Main_33_049,"Let's join this fight...!"
CH8_Main_33_050,"Even if it's dangerous, we have to do it!"
CH8_Main_33_051,"Yaaaaah!"
CH8_Main_33_052,"Kuhh! Wh-what is this!?"
CH8_Main_33_053,"It's an explosive arrow made from Mad Dragon Svelta's bones!"
CH8_Main_33_054,"Even if you have a dragon's body, this should hurt!"
CH8_Main_33_055,"Kuh, you trash...!"
CH8_Main_33_056,"You think you'll stop me with this!?"
CH8_Main_33_057,"I'll crush you... Ugh!?"
CH8_Main_33_058,"How does it feel, falling for the same attack twice, Draconic!"
CH8_Main_33_059,"You dared to laugh at my flames! Take this!!!"
CH8_Main_33_060,"Kuahhh, the fragments of the castle...!"
CH8_Main_33_061,"Heh heh heh, I've found a weakness!"
CH8_Main_33_062,"...!?! Wh-what's this!!"
CH8_Main_33_063,"Hahaha, you were planning on eating all these souls by yourself?"
CH8_Main_33_064,"Come on. I'll eat them for you!"
CH8_Main_33_065,"Thanks for the food!"
CH8_Main_33_066,"Kuhahaha, it's so fun beating up the big guy!"
CH8_Main_33_067,"I'll rip out your scales!!! I'll tear them all off!"
CH8_Main_33_068,"I'll pulverize every part of you!!"
CH8_Main_33_069,"Ugh, these flies...!"
CH8_Main_33_070,"This is the end, you trash! I'll get rid of you all - Ugh!?!!"
CH8_Main_33_071,"Laias: You're full of openings, Infira!!"
CH8_Main_33_072,"Kyaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_33_073,"Laias: Now, Kasel!"
CH8_Main_33_074,"Kasel: Holy Sword -"
CH8_Main_33_075,"Kasel: Grant me your power!!!"
CH8_Main_33_076,"Infira: ?!"
CH8_Main_33_077,"Infira: You - when did you!!"
CH8_Main_33_078,"Kasel: This opportunity that everyone made for me - "
CH8_Main_33_079,"Kasel: I won't let it go to waste!!!"
CH8_Main_33_080,"Infira: Damn, damn, damn!!!"
CH8_Main_33_081,"Infira: Me, losing to trash like you - "
CH8_Main_33_082,"Kasel: Haaaaaaaa---!!!!"
CH8_Main_33_083,"Kasel: This is the end, Infira!!"
CH8_Main_33_084,"Infira: Graaaaaagh!!!!"
CH8_Main_33_085,"Infira: No... way..."
CH8_Main_33_086,"It's finally over."
CH8_Main_33_087,"Phew... It's been a while since I've used my original form."
CH8_Main_33_088,"Ah... I can't..."
CH8_Main_33_089,"Are you okay?"
CH8_Main_33_090,"Go over there and take a rest"
CH8_Main_33_091,"Wait, something's strange."
CH8_Main_33_092,"I absorbed many souls..."
CH8_Main_33_093,"But I didn't feel anything as powerful as that..."
CH8_Main_33_094,"!!! Everyone, look over there!"
CH8_Main_33_095,"Kuh... I... Can't end like this...!"
CH8_Main_33_096,"He's still alive...!"
CH8_Main_33_097,"It was a direct hit with the Holy Sword...!"
CH8_Main_33_098,"Kuh... If this rift will disappear anyway..."
CH8_Main_33_099,"I'll take you with me...!"
CH8_Main_33_100,"What is he doing to the dimensional rift...?"
CH8_Main_33_101,"If a magic spell is cast on that unstable vortex of evil energy,"
CH8_Main_33_102,"the whole volcano will explode...!"
CH8_Main_33_103,"We have to stop him!"
CH8_Main_33_104,"Kill him!!"
CH8_Main_33_105,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
CH8_Main_33_106,"Morrah: So you did get in my way."
CH8_Main_33_107,"Morrah: What did I say, Infira?"
CH8_Main_33_108,"Infira: Kuh...?"
CH8_Main_33_109,"Infira: M-Morrah!?"
CH8_Main_33_110,"Infira: Wh-what are you...?"
CH8_Main_33_111,"?!!"
CH8_Main_33_112,"I told you."
CH8_Main_33_113,"That if you ruined this, I would take your neck."
CH8_Main_33_114,"Ruin...?"
CH8_Main_33_115,"The dimensional rift is a precious resource."
CH8_Main_33_116,"You tried to destroy it."
CH8_Main_33_117,"That was... the Warrior of the Holy Sword...!"
CH8_Main_33_118,"Hahaha."
CH8_Main_33_119,"When did I say that the Warrior of the Holy Sword closed the dimensional rift?"
CH8_Main_33_120,"...!!!"
CH8_Main_33_121,"I only said that the rifts disappeared in every area that they passed by."
CH8_Main_33_122,"Then...!"
CH8_Main_33_123,"Hahaha, you finally understand?"
CH8_Main_33_124,"The dimensional rift is the aggregation of a great power."
CH8_Main_33_125,"Give up that power to Maria."
CH8_Main_33_126,"You're betraying me...!?"
CH8_Main_33_127,"Heh, what a stupid thing to say."
CH8_Main_33_128,"You were my pawn at one point, but that was a long time ago."
CH8_Main_33_129,"I don't follow the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_33_130,"I only follow Maria."
CH8_Main_33_131,"Ugh..."
CH8_Main_33_132,"Die now, Infira."
CH8_Main_33_133,"Everything is for Maria..."
CH8_Main_34_001,"Well, now..."
CH8_Main_34_002,"The dimensional rift is closing down little by little..."
CH8_Main_34_003,"Did he absorb that power and put it in that bead...!?"
CH8_Main_34_004,"But why...?"
CH8_Main_34_005,"Whatever his goal was, wasn't he part of the Dark Force?"
CH8_Main_34_006,"That's not what's important..."
CH8_Main_34_007,"I wonder... What he wants to do with all that power..."
CH8_Main_34_008,"Shouldn't we stop him?"
CH8_Main_34_009,"It's too late."
CH8_Main_34_010,"Anyway. Now that it's come to this, shouldn't it be safe once the Demons in the desert are eliminated?"
CH8_Main_34_011,"That Theo. He won't have that much work to do now."
CH8_Main_34_012,"I guess that helps..."
CH8_Main_34_013,"Whew."
CH8_Main_34_014,"It's finally over."
CH8_Main_34_015,"Thanks, Warrior of the Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_34_016,"My mission was accomplished more easily, thanks to you."
CH8_Main_34_017,"You used us, Morrah?"
CH8_Main_34_018,"Used you?"
CH8_Main_34_019,"You could say that."
CH8_Main_34_020,"But isn't it good for you that the dimensional rift was closed?"
CH8_Main_34_021,"…"
CH8_Main_34_022,"I have a question, Morrah."
CH8_Main_34_023,"What will you use that great power for?"
CH8_Main_34_024,"I don't have a reason to answer that."
CH8_Main_34_025,"But... Okay, since you helped me, I'll toss you a bone."
CH8_Main_34_026,"If you want to know, come to the swamps of Gargoss."
CH8_Main_34_027,"I'll get going, then."
CH8_Main_34_028,"Since at least one of you seems to want to come at me,"
CH8_Main_34_029,"there's no reason for me to stay here and waste energy."
CH8_Main_34_030,"Tch, you found out."
CH8_Main_34_031,"I didn't get to eat Infira since you killed him,"
CH8_Main_34_032,"so I thought I could take your soul instead."
CH8_Main_34_033,"Sorry, but I've got no reason to fight right now."
CH8_Main_34_034,"Go eat somewhere else."
CH8_Main_34_035,"Bye, then."
CH8_Main_34_036,"Hey! Where are you running off to!?"
CH8_Main_34_037,"You're still hungry after all that!?"
CH8_Main_34_038,"I told you, strong guys are special!"
CH8_Main_34_039,"He looked so delicious, too...!"
CH8_Main_34_040,"*Sigh.* Come on! Learn to be more patient!"
CH8_Main_34_041,"You know, coming from you, that doesn't sound convincing."
CH8_Main_34_042,"What did you just say!?"
CH8_Main_34_043,"Morrah left."
CH8_Main_34_044,"But at least the rift in the volcano is gone."
CH8_Main_34_045,"The activity from the volcano will die down."
CH8_Main_34_046,"Since it was affected by the dimensional rift..."
CH8_Main_34_047,"So, what's everyone planning to do?"
CH8_Main_34_048,"I'll get going."
CH8_Main_34_049,"Now that the volcano is stable, I'll go look for that Succubus."
CH8_Main_34_050,"I'll continue searching around the area."
CH8_Main_34_051,"There are some Draconics left."
CH8_Main_34_052,"But after I'm done eating them... I'll eat Malduk and that Morrah from earlier!"
CH8_Main_34_053,"Hm. I'll go to Phillop and check how Temeraire is."
CH8_Main_34_054,"After that, I'll return to the desert and see how the people there are."
CH8_Main_34_055,"Yanne, what will you do?"
CH8_Main_34_056,"I'll go with you."
CH8_Main_34_057,"I need to find my next job."
CH8_Main_34_058,"It was nice meeting you all."
CH8_Main_34_059,"I'm sure we'll meet again."
CH8_Main_34_060,"Thank you, Laias and Yanne."
CH8_Main_34_061,"We'll see you next time."
CH8_Main_34_062,"What should we do?"
CH8_Main_34_063,"Morrah said... Gargoss?"
CH8_Main_34_064,"I'm worried about that place."
CH8_Main_34_065,"Gargoss... Wasn't it turned into ruins after the Demon War 100 years ago?"
CH8_Main_34_066,"They say the Galluah Plains are now a dead wasteland,"
CH8_Main_34_067,"and the swamps of Gargoss are a cursed land filled with evil and vengeful spirits."
CH8_Main_34_068,"It is also said that it's where Angmund built his castle."
CH8_Main_34_069,"It's a terrible place..."
CH8_Main_34_070,"Well, we'll have to go to Gargoss, since Morrah mentioned it."
CH8_Main_34_071,"If we want to find out even a little about what's behind all this."
CH8_Main_35_001,"Ugh, I smell something rotten..."
CH8_Main_35_002,"It's proof that we're near Gargoss."
CH8_Main_35_003,"There's a rumor that says that even the land is rotting there..."
CH8_Main_35_004,"Shh, stop for a sec."
CH8_Main_35_005,"That is…."
CH8_Main_35_006,"Hahaha, what is it, Maria?"
CH8_Main_35_007,"Didn't you swear loyalty to him?"
CH8_Main_35_008,"It's not like you can't cooperate, right?"
CH8_Main_35_009,"Hmph. It doesn't mean that I have a reason to cooperate with you."
CH8_Main_35_010,"I won't act unless it is an order from the Black Knight."
CH8_Main_35_011,"Oh, I see."
CH8_Main_35_012,"So even though he didn't order it,"
CH8_Main_35_013,"you followed the Warrior of the Holy Sword, egging him on,"
CH8_Main_35_014,"closing the dimensional rifts, ruining the plans of the Dark Force,"
CH8_Main_35_015,"and planted the seeds of war to create chaos and postpone the occupation of each region."
CH8_Main_35_016,"Were those things all an order from him?"
CH8_Main_35_017,"...What are you talking about?"
CH8_Main_35_018,"There's no use in acting innocent."
CH8_Main_35_019,"You told Lorraine in Elidora about the Nucleus of Darkness."
CH8_Main_35_020,"And you made the Goblins of Ogria stand up against the Orcs to make room for the warrior to enter."
CH8_Main_35_021,"And you sent the traitor Epis to the Galluah Plains."
CH8_Main_35_022,"You used the Gnolls in Arrovina to confuse the Dark Elves,"
CH8_Main_35_023,"and you made the revengeful spirit to remove the mind control on El Rosed..."
CH8_Main_35_024,"And now Infira is dead, the Mad Dragon Temeraire is sealed, and even the dimensional rift is closed."
CH8_Main_35_025,"You really don't know?"
CH8_Main_35_026,"You underestimated me, fallen Saintess."
CH8_Main_35_027,"Isn't that so, Sublime One?"
CH8_Main_35_028,"?!!"
CH8_Main_35_029,"Black... Knight? When...!!"
CH8_Main_35_030,"Sublime One, give the traitor her punishment."
CH8_Main_35_031,"Death to the traitor."
CH8_Main_35_032,"…."
CH8_Main_35_033,"!!!"
CH8_Main_35_034,"Kwaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_35_035,"Morrah!!"
CH8_Main_35_036,"That's... the Black Knight!!"
CH8_Main_35_037,"It's overwhelming..."
CH8_Main_35_038,"Ugh... Just looking at him is making my legs shake...!"
CH8_Main_35_039,"Huh!?"
CH8_Main_35_040,"The Holy Sword is reacting in the direction of the Black Knight...!"
CH8_Main_35_041,"What is going on...?"
CH8_Main_35_042,"Tsk tsk. Even the first Draconic has betrayed me."
CH8_Main_35_043,"He was much better when he was just a vicious soldier."
CH8_Main_35_044,"Shut... up!"
CH8_Main_35_045,"Is it because you ate the Holy Dragon Oricana when the warrior came to kill the Dark Lord?"
CH8_Main_35_046,"The blessed ancient Red Dragon that served Saintess Maria...!"
CH8_Main_35_047,"Yes, that was it."
CH8_Main_35_048,"You removed its heart and had its blood."
CH8_Main_35_049,"I said, shut up, Malduk!!!!"
CH8_Main_35_050,"Kugh..."
CH8_Main_35_051,"Hahaha, Draconics were made to eat dragons and take their powers."
CH8_Main_35_052,"They're just weapons that resembled the dragons they ate. Infira and Kalax were good examples."
CH8_Main_35_053,"But you couldn't absorb the powerful Oricana's soul, so you made it part of yourself."
CH8_Main_35_054,"And by meeting Maria, it accepted you as well!!"
CH8_Main_35_055,"Ha ha... Hahaha... How come I didn't know?"
CH8_Main_35_056,"I had such a good experiment subject in front of my eyes!!"
CH8_Main_35_057,"A complete fusion of a Draconic and a dragon!"
CH8_Main_35_058,"Holy Dragon Oricana..."
CH8_Main_35_059,"The dragon of a nameless priestess... She was known as the priestess of dragons and was a comrade of King Kyle...!"
CH8_Main_35_060,"Then... The nameless priestess that helped King Kyle 100 years ago is... Priestess Maria!?!"
CH8_Main_35_061,"I thought that Maria and Morrah were part of the Dark Force...!!"
CH8_Main_35_062,"So what they've done so far... is to ruin the plans of the Dark Force!?"
CH8_Main_35_063,"Tsk. What a turn of events. Everything we've known so far has been turned upside-down."
CH8_Main_35_064,"A-anyway, we must go help them...!"
CH8_Main_35_065,"Y-you think we can win against that thing?"
CH8_Main_35_066,"Malduk is there, too!"
CH8_Main_35_067,"Honestly, I don't think we can win..."
CH8_Main_35_068,"But we need to try at least...!"
CH8_Main_35_069,"Kasel...!!"
CH8_Main_35_070,"Ugh, that idiot!!"
CH8_Main_35_071,"I agree... But he's right, we have to help. Let's go!"
CH8_Main_35_072,"Then, die here. Maria."
CH8_Main_35_073,"….!"
CH8_Main_35_074,"That is…!?"
CH8_Main_35_075,"Malduk! Black Knight! Stop there!"
CH8_Main_35_076,"Don't you dare lay a finger on them!"
CH8_Main_35_077,"...Holy Sword!?"
CH8_Main_35_078,"N-no! If you fight the Black Knight now...!"
CH8_Main_35_079,"…"
CH8_Main_35_080,"The Holy Sword."
CH8_Main_35_081,"?!"
CH8_Main_35_082,"Holy Sword... Holy Sword..."
CH8_Main_35_083,"Holy Sword... Lua... Lua!!!"
CH8_Main_35_084,"Die, dog of Lua..."
CH8_Main_35_085,"Kyaaaak!!!"
CH8_Main_35_086,"Th-this power...!!"
CH8_Main_35_087,"Kuh...! It's too great..."
CH8_Main_35_088,"The power... in my body...!!"
CH8_Main_35_089,"The shield was destroyed in one hit..."
CH8_Main_35_090,"Get lost!!"
CH8_Main_35_091,"That's it!!"
CH8_Main_35_092,"Kuh!!"
CH8_Main_35_093,"Haaa!!"
CH8_Main_35_094,"Tsk. I aimed for his head, but it did nothing...!"
CH8_Main_35_095,"An Angel."
CH8_Main_35_096,"Another dog of Lua..."
CH8_Main_35_097,"That's it, Dark Lord Kyle."
CH8_Main_35_098,"I won't let the second Warrior of the Holy Sword die at your hands."
CH8_Main_35_099,"The Holy Sword is no longer yours."
CH8_Main_35_100,"You think a mere Angel can stop me?"
CH8_Main_35_101,"Hm. Don't make me laugh."
CH8_Main_35_102,"Dark Lord Kyle!?"
CH8_Main_35_103,"Kyle, the Warrior of the Holy Sword from 100 years ago!?!"
CH8_Main_35_104,"The Warrior of the Holy Sword is the Dark Lord!?"
CH8_Main_35_105,"What is going on...!?"
CH8_Main_35_106,"That's King Kyle,"
CH8_Main_35_107,"my... father...?"
CH8_Main_35_108,"…"
CH8_Main_35_109,"The Warrior of the Holy Sword, and even an Angel have appeared."
CH8_Main_35_110,"Sublime One, may I suggest we retreat."
CH8_Main_35_111,"We can get rid of the Warrior of the Holy Sword anytime."
CH8_Main_35_112,"It's not time yet."
CH8_Main_35_113,"Of course, you must feel angered... But it is not time yet."
CH8_Main_35_114,"…"
CH8_Main_35_115,"Malduk, if you say so..."
CH8_Main_35_116,"I'll do as you say."
CH8_Main_35_117,"But..."
CH8_Main_35_118,"There won't be a next time."
CH8_Main_35_119,"…"
CH8_Main_35_120,"Father… Huh..."
