CS_CHE_H1_1_001,"May~!! Let's play!!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_002,"Carrot candy! Do you have any Carrot candy?!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_003,"Carrot Candy? I've never heard of that...well, I do have chocolate, though?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_004,"Chocolate is good too!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_005,"Nom nom...eh, who's that tall lady over there? Never seen her before!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_006,"Ah, you mean Yanne?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_007,"She's amazing, you know! She even has the title of a 'Dragon Slayer'!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_008,"There used to be this evil, scary dragon called Svelta the Mad a few years ago. She slew that dragon alone, without any help!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_009,"Mad? What, was he always angry?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_010,"Some dragons get corrupted and go crazy. They wreak havoc instead of guarding the world, as they should."
CS_CHE_H1_1_011,"May, I put the requested Dragon Scales, Hide and other materials outside."
CS_CHE_H1_1_012,"Thank you~hehe."
CS_CHE_H1_1_013,"Dragons are those huge fat lizards, right? Wow! You're really strong, tall sis!!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_014,"Just don't let the blacksmith across the road catch you saying that, ok?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_015,"Hehe, Jin is a nice person, so it should be fine."
CS_CHE_H1_1_016,"By the way, May! Something feels different! The shop, and your clothes too!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_017,"Oh, there were a lot of costume requests due to the Halloween festival tonight."
CS_CHE_H1_1_018,"So, I gave it my all!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_019,"With that level of skill, you wouldn't have to continue this general store business. You'd make it big as a famous tailor, no doubt."
CS_CHE_H1_1_020,"Ahaha, well, making clothes is more of a hobby."
CS_CHE_H1_1_021,"Wow, so cute!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_022,"I want one! Anything for me?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_023,"Ah, there should be several outfits just your size. Do you want to try some on?"
CS_CHE_H1_1_024,"Yes! Gimme gimme!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_025,"Ok~ Just wait a sec, I'll bring a few costumes!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_027,"Aaaaaah!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_028,"May!! Did something happen?!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_030,"...No answer. Can't be helped, let's go in."
CS_CHE_H1_1_031,"Eh? I can't see!!"
CS_CHE_H1_1_032,"..The power of darkness? No, it's a bit different..."
CS_CHE_H1_1_034,"Tall sis, this is..."
CS_CHE_H1_1_035,"...Yeah, seems like it."
CS_CHE_H1_1_036,"We're faaaaaaalllllllliiiiiiiiiiiing--!!!"
CS_CHE_H1_2_001,"....Ugh...where are we..?"
CS_CHE_H1_2_002,"Uuuu, it hurts...I hit my head!"
CS_CHE_H1_2_003,"But where's May...ah!"
CS_CHE_H1_2_004,"She's only unconscious. Thankfully, she isn't hurt."
CS_CHE_H1_2_005,"May! No sleeping outdoors! You'll catch a cold!"
CS_CHE_H1_2_006,"Ugh....ummm....huh? Yanne...? Luna...?"
CS_CHE_H1_2_007,"Where is this? I was looking for my costumes..."
CS_CHE_H1_2_008,"I was rummaging through the wardrobes, but about six were missing, so..."
CS_CHE_H1_2_009,"Wait, we'll talk later. I feel something...ominous."
CS_CHE_H1_3_001,"Weird. These pumpkin-covered monsters...they aren't normal undead."
CS_CHE_H1_3_002,"They feel very different from the undead usually seen in our world.."
CS_CHE_H1_3_003,"Tall sis, they're still the bad guys, right? I can hit them, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_3_004,"Still, they have cute heads!"
CS_CHE_H1_3_005,"Let's take them off and display them at May's shop!"
CS_CHE_H1_3_006,"Ahaha, I already have plenty of pumpkin themed accessories back at the shop, so..."
CS_CHE_H1_3_007,"They may be different, but they're still hostile. We're breaking through."
CS_CHE_H1_4_001,"Shh, stop for a sec. That's..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_002,"...What's that?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_003,"I don't know...but they look like evil spirits. They probably took the form of people from our world, though..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_004,"There's one that stands out, too!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_006,"Eh? What is it?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_007,"Ahahaha...um...that's one of the missing costumes I was looking for back at the shop."
CS_CHE_H1_4_008,"Hm, themed after the mummies back at Aegina Desert, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_009,"She's only wearing bandages! Is she hurt?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_010,"Ahahaha..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_011,"Still, I don't understand. Who is that, and why is she wearing my costume...?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_012,"She does feel similar to the other evil spirits, but..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_013,"She's still a bad guy, right? A baddie thief that stole May's costume!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_014,"I'm gonna get it back!!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_015,"Luna! It's dangerous to go alone!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_016,"???"
CS_CHE_H1_4_017,"Don't rush things!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_018,"...Did Luna's attack just not work?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_019,"May's attack worked, though...uuu...."
CS_CHE_H1_4_020,"...I definitely felt some kind of aura spark between the costumes..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_021,"Eh? You mean the ones May made?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_022,"Yes. I guess something is going on with the costumes here."
CS_CHE_H1_4_024,"May, do you have any other costumes on hand?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_025,"Ah, yes...they're mostly the ones I was going to show Luna...and..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_026,"...a few others, hehehe..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_027,"....?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_028,"Well, let's see."
CS_CHE_H1_4_029,"Cute! Very cute! I love it!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_030,"Ahaha, thanks, Luna! You're too cute~"
CS_CHE_H1_4_032,"....So, this is the only thing that fits me, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_033,"Haha...this is a bit embarassing."
CS_CHE_H1_4_034,"Ahaha, it is kind of...breezy, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_4_035,"...B, but it looks really good!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_036,"Bunny ears, bunny ears!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_037,"You look like a grown up Luna!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_038,"...Haha, well, can't be helped."
CS_CHE_H1_4_039,"Anyway, I have a hunch. To defeat the costume-wearing evil spirits..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_040,"we need to be wearing May-made costumes ourselves."
CS_CHE_H1_4_041,"Now then, carefully..."
CS_CHE_H1_4_042,"Chaaaaaaargeeeee!!!!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_043,"...Hahahaha, she's funny."
CS_CHE_H1_4_044,"Ah, hell with it. Hey~wait for me!"
CS_CHE_H1_4_045,"Ah! Luna, I already said it's dangerous to go alone!"
CS_CHE_H1_5_001,"That makes three! Three more to go, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_5_002,"Yeah, we're halfway there!"
CS_CHE_H1_5_003,"I still don't know why my clothes have this kind of power, though."
CS_CHE_H1_5_004,"The evil spirits turned into orbs of light and disappeared! The other monsters went with them too! Weird~"
CS_CHE_H1_5_005,"It's definitely an interesting phenomenon. Evil spirits usually don't just get purified this easily..."
CS_CHE_H1_5_006,"Well, that's not important. Right now, let's focus on getting back May's costumes and finding a way out."
CS_CHE_H1_5_007,"It seems to be a given that there are a lot of evil spirits converging around those with costumes, though."
CS_CHE_H1_5_008,"Let's try...that way, next."
CS_CHE_H1_6_001,"So this is the last group of monsters, correct?"
CS_CHE_H1_6_002,"We found 5 costumes so far, so yeah, this should be the last!"
CS_CHE_H1_6_003,"Already? I want to blast a few more pumpkins!"
CS_CHE_H1_6_004,"It's kind of worriying that we still have no clues to how to get back..."
CS_CHE_H1_6_005,"But well, let's first find that last costume."
CS_CHE_H1_7_001,"...? That is..."
CS_CHE_H1_7_002,"Wait, this is odd. May, that is one of your costumes, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_003,"Hm? Ah, yes! That's actually one of the first I made!"
CS_CHE_H1_7_004,"...Feels off...doesn't look like an evil spirit."
CS_CHE_H1_7_005,"Hm, that should be because I am no evil spirit. I am but a mere magus."
CS_CHE_H1_7_006,"...!!"
CS_CHE_H1_7_007,"Hahaha, no need to worry."
CS_CHE_H1_7_008,"Good to see you, May. I am sorry to get you involved with my mistakes."
CS_CHE_H1_7_009,"...Mr. Nyx? Mr. Nyx, is that you? Phew, and I thought an evil spirit had taken your shape, like those others..."
CS_CHE_H1_7_010,"Haha, I don't blame you for thinking so."
CS_CHE_H1_7_011,"Thank you for those costumes, by the way. They were just as I had asked for."
CS_CHE_H1_7_012,"You did an amazing job."
CS_CHE_H1_7_013,"Costumes?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_014,"Ah, actually, Mr. Nyx is a travelling magus who pops in every once in a while."
CS_CHE_H1_7_015,"He put in a request for a lot of costumes for the Halloween event, because of some experiment or something."
CS_CHE_H1_7_016,"He gave me a lot of high-quality materials and thread, and aside from a few specially requested designs, let me make whatever I want."
CS_CHE_H1_7_017,"So the costumes we saw so far..."
CS_CHE_H1_7_018,"were made with whatever materials he gave you?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_019,"That is so. Unfortunately, I needed some of the costumes urgently, so I was thinking of taking a few back with me early."
CS_CHE_H1_7_020,"However, due to unforseen events, I involved you all into this mess."
CS_CHE_H1_7_021,"I'm sorry for startling you all."
CS_CHE_H1_7_022,"Well, you paid me beforehand and also let me keep the leftover material for my own projects, so it's fine if you wanted to take some ahead of schedule..."
CS_CHE_H1_7_023,"But what exactly is going on...?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_024,"Hmm, sadly, I cannot explain right now."
CS_CHE_H1_7_025,"First, you must defeat me."
CS_CHE_H1_7_026,"Wait, what?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_027,"Due to a mixup in the experiment, my body isn't fully under my control."
CS_CHE_H1_7_028,"Evil spirit?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_029,"Yes, you are correct. I have been suppressing the spirit stuck to this costume, but without help, I cannot get rid of it."
CS_CHE_H1_7_030,"Hmm...by the way."
CS_CHE_H1_7_031,"At any rate, you're the one who got us all in danger, right?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_032,"...Yes, it is so. Once again, I am sor -"
CS_CHE_H1_7_033,"Can it. You can apologize after I get a few punches in."
CS_CHE_H1_7_034,"..Is tall sis angry?"
CS_CHE_H1_7_035,"Ahaha...."
CS_CHE_H1_8_001,"Enough, enough. The evil spirit has been purified, so put down that arrow. I'll die, you know."
CS_CHE_H1_8_002,"...Tch, you didn't even get hit properly one time."
CS_CHE_H1_8_003,"Hahaha...well, if I do get hit properly, I wouldn't be able to apologize properly."
CS_CHE_H1_8_004,"Isn't that so? The last female warrior of the Barbarian race, Dragon Slayer Yanne."
CS_CHE_H1_8_005,"...Hmph. Fine."
CS_CHE_H1_8_006,"The evil spirit is gone. Time for you to tell us how to get back to our world."
CS_CHE_H1_8_007,"Hm? If it's returning you want to do, I can help you anytime. This is a world I created with my magic, after all."
CS_CHE_H1_8_008,"Well, it's only possible because you helped me get rid of that evil spirit. Please put down that arrow."
CS_CHE_H1_8_009,"I created a portal behind myself, so if you wish to return, just walk through it."
CS_CHE_H1_8_010,"Wait! I have a question!"
CS_CHE_H1_8_011,"What kind of experiment were you doing, Mr. Odd Eyes?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_012,"...Haha, you're quite the curious one, little miss."
CS_CHE_H1_8_013,"Hm. You must know that Halloween has its roots in remembering those who have passed on, no?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_014,"Some evil spirits, instead of passing on, remain to harm people throughout the festival."
CS_CHE_H1_8_015,"So, I was thinking of creating a festival for only evil spirits, where no humans would be put at risk."
CS_CHE_H1_8_016,"The experiment was initially a failure, but thanks to you all, I managed to clean up the mess."
CS_CHE_H1_8_017,"Eh? So all this was just a really fun party for evil spirits?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_018,"Yes, that is so."
CS_CHE_H1_8_019,"One more question! What did May's costumes have to do with all this?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_020,"Oh, that was part of the things the evil spirits wanted to do for the festival."
CS_CHE_H1_8_021,"Some wanted to merely fight. Some wanted nice things to eat. Others wished for beautiful clothing."
CS_CHE_H1_8_022,"In the end, I requested special costumes with a Halloween vibe that would help fulfill their final wishes."
CS_CHE_H1_8_023,"Considering it made it into this world, I suppose your costume also fits the taste of a certain evil spirit, Yanne."
CS_CHE_H1_8_026,"....Hmm? Maybe I guessed wrong. Was that one of the costumes made from the remaining material..."
CS_CHE_H1_8_027,"Aha..ahahaha...Nooooooo!!"
CS_CHE_H1_8_028,"....Well, she did say making clothes was her hobby."
CS_CHE_H1_8_029,"I guess she is interested in...a wide variety of designs."
CS_CHE_H1_8_030,"How adventurous."
CS_CHE_H1_8_031,"Eh? Wait, but why did we have to wear May's costumes to defeat those costume-wearing spirits?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_032,"Hm? I never invoked such magic."
CS_CHE_H1_8_033,"Haha, well, perhaps the evil spirits had a strong desire to play with those who were also dressing up, while refusing to play with those without the Halloween spirit."
CS_CHE_H1_8_034,"Wow, and I thought I was the only one having fun! So...they were enjoying the fact that I was dunking their faces in carrots?"
CS_CHE_H1_8_035,"Hehe, hopefully they all pass on peacefully to carrot heaven."
CS_CCE_C1_1_001,"Hmm? My, if it isn't the lady of the Daphnel family. What brings you here?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_002,"CONVERSATION_SURPRISE"
CS_CCE_C1_1_003,"...The Queen of Penthe...!"
CS_CCE_C1_1_004,"Shh. I kept my identity a secret all this way to Orvelia, the Kingdom of Heroes."
CS_CCE_C1_1_005,"No need for the formalities in such a public area."
CS_CCE_C1_1_006,"Hmm, how about this."
CS_CCE_C1_1_007,"...?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_008,"For the day, you will be my friend."
CS_CCE_C1_1_009,"Let us redo our greetings, then."
CS_CCE_C1_1_010,"Hello, Aisha. What a beautiful morning it is."
CS_CCE_C1_1_011,"CONVERSATION_SILENCE"
CS_CCE_C1_1_012,"Ahem. Y...yes, Artemia. Good...morning."
CS_CCE_C1_1_013,"I don't think I have seen you around lately, ever since that party at the palace."
CS_CCE_C1_1_014,"What brings you to Orvelia?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_015,"Hmm, Christmas...was it? I'm not too sure what it's meant to celebrate."
CS_CCE_C1_1_016,"Still, I heard it was a day of meaningful festivities, and thus I have come to experience them first-hand."
CS_CCE_C1_1_017,"This year's festival was named...'The Secret Santa Festival', I assume?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_018,"Ah, yes. This year's festival is a bit different from the others before it."
CS_CCE_C1_1_019,"The staff are setting up artificial monsters the town. These monsters drop certain coins when caught..."
CS_CCE_C1_1_020,"and the participants can exchange those coins for presents to give to the children of the city."
CS_CCE_C1_1_021,"Hmm, so why are you, the daughter of an esteemed noble family, participating in such an event?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_022,"Noblesse Oblige. It is the duty of us nobles to do right for the people."
CS_CCE_C1_1_023,"Disregarding birth and blood, children are the future of the country. It is a given that we nobles take care of them, and bring them happiness."
CS_CCE_C1_1_024,"As expected from the Daphnel family."
CS_CCE_C1_1_025,"I am curious, though - is your maid not with you today?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_026,"Priscilla had to take care of some other business, so she couldn't come."
CS_CCE_C1_1_027,"I'll need someone else to fill in for the Rudolph position..."
CS_CCE_C1_1_028,"The event doesn't start until a few hours later...so I'll have to find someone to stand in."
CS_CCE_C1_1_029,"Rudolph? Ah, the red-nosed reindeer?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_030,"Yes, participants need to be in a team of at least one Santa and one Rudoph to take part."
CS_CCE_C1_1_031,"Of course, it doesn't matter if there are more than one Santa or Rudolph in a team."
CS_CCE_C1_1_032,"Hmm, I thought I didn't need an escort today, so I came alone..."
CS_CCE_C1_1_033,"A cute reindeer...hmm, what about that person over there?"
CS_CCE_C1_1_034,"CONVERSATION_SURPRISE"
CS_CCE_C1_1_035,"Let's go, before someone else takes him!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_001,"Hmm..that way? I see, that way!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_002,"Looks like he's going somewhere in a busy fashion. I wonder why?"
CS_CCE_C1_2_003,"I don't know, but it seems he's in a hurry."
CS_CCE_C1_2_004,"Still, I see the monsters have been released already even though the festival hasn't begun."
CS_CCE_C1_2_005,"We need a Rudolph fast..."
CS_CCE_C1_2_006,"I found you, Fake Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_007,"CONVERSATION_SURPRISE"
CS_CCE_C1_2_008,"Eh? Fake Santa? How rude!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_009,"See? I even have my Rudolph right here!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_010,"That's a fake! Objects don't count!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_011,"Also, the goal of this event is to give presents to the good kids!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_012,"You just want to steal all the snacks the people put out for Santa!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_013,"Eh? What do you take me for, a mere snack thief?"
CS_CCE_C1_2_014,"I am the Great Miruru! I wouldn't stoop so low!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_015,"Lies! The Spirits told me everything!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_016,"When you were changing back at May's,"
CS_CCE_C1_2_017,"you were reciting your plan to yourself and laughing 'wahahaha'!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_018,"Tch, busted...wait, were you spying on me changing?!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_019,"What are you saying? Spirits are everywhere in the world."
CS_CCE_C1_2_020,"Aaaargh!! What's done is done!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_021,"I'll turn you into Roast Rudolph for the sake of my sna...no, for the prosperity of the Miruru Pirates!!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_022,"Hmph, it surprises me to see such a bad Santa."
CS_CCE_C1_2_023,"I cannot let this happen. The Secret Santa Festival exists to bring happiness to the children,"
CS_CCE_C1_2_024,"not for some crook to steal all the food. For that, punishment is due."
CS_CCE_C1_2_025,"So, little Rudoph. Let us help you with this situation. Instead..."
CS_CCE_C1_2_026,"Hm? Oh, you want me to become your Rudolph?"
CS_CCE_C1_2_027,"OK! If you help me with my work, I'll help you too!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_028,"There's no rule saying that the Staff cannot participate in a team!"
CS_CCE_C1_2_029,"Good, that speeds things up."
CS_CCE_C1_2_030,"Now, let us kick out this rude little Santa."
CS_CCE_C1_3_001,"Out with you, Thief Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_002,"Noooooo!! My snaaaaaacks~~!!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_003,"Hmm, I do feel a bit bad. She was just a child..."
CS_CCE_C1_3_004,"It's fine! Her soul's age is like t...Eh? Oh, so I shouldn't say that?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_005,"Ok! I won't talk about a woman's age!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_006,"I have no idea what kind of magic you're using, but you must be very talented....um..."
CS_CCE_C1_3_007,"Er...Mr. Reindeer."
CS_CCE_C1_3_008,"Oh, my name is Rephy! I'm a Tamian Guide!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_009,"Nice to meet you, Artemia, Aisha!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_010,"The Tamia...if I'm correct, that is a rare race that lives in the Elidora Forest..."
CS_CCE_C1_3_011,"Wait, I don't think we introduced ourselves yet...?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_012,"Ah, the Spirits told me all about you!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_013,"My usual job is to guide wandering spirits towards the Otherworld,"
CS_CCE_C1_3_014,"but sometimes they don't leave and just stick to places, usually around me!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_015,"They tell me all sorts of things!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_016,"Aren't those kinds of spirits usually vengeful spirits or evil ghosts...?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_017,"Eh? No, these children are very nice!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_018,"They can be mischievous, but they don't hurt people!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_019,"I...I see. Good to meet you, Rephy."
CS_CCE_C1_3_020,"Why are you, a member of the staff, in such a rush to find people like that child, though?"
CS_CCE_C1_3_021,"Oh? That? There are some people that aren't taking this event seriously enough!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_022,"The Spirits told me of a Thief Santa, a Prankster Santa and a Drunk Santa!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_023,"I have to scold them and stop them from ruining the event!"
CS_CCE_C1_3_024,"Hmm, I see."
CS_CCE_C1_3_025,"Well, I have no wish to see the first event I participated in fall into ruin,"
CS_CCE_C1_3_026,"so I - no, we'll help you."
CS_CCE_C1_3_027,"In exchange, I hope you'll help us with the main festival, Rephy."
CS_CCE_C1_3_028,"Thanks! I'm in your care!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_001,"Now then, time to catch Prankster Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_002,"A Prankster...what kind of pranks does this Santa plan to pull?"
CS_CCE_C1_4_003,"Eh? Ah, this Santa wants to sneak into people's beds and play pranks on them while they sleep!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_004,"CONVERSATION_SURPRISE"
CS_CCE_C1_4_005,"I dunno what these pranks are, but people might be startled! So I can't allow this!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_006,"I mean, last Halloween was free of evil spirits and their evil pranks! And that was a relief for everyone!"
CS_CCE_C1_4_007,"Belated pranks can wait till the next Halloween!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_001,"Found you, Prankster Santa! No, Weird Demon!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_002,"Hm?! A Demon?!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_003,"My, what a cute little reindeer. Still, calling me a Prankster...and hey, I'm not weird at all!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_004,"I'm the kindest and least harmful Demon of them all!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_005,"But you're still going to sneak in people's beds and surprise them!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_006,"The Spirits heard you talk about this to some girl in a coffin! You know, the one who can't live or die!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_007,"Eh? How did you..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_008,"Vile Demon..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_009,"Not only did you bring an Undead to this city,"
CS_CCE_C1_5_010,"but you also now try to sneak into people's houses and harm the innocent?!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_011,"As I thought, Demons cannot be trusted."
CS_CCE_C1_5_012,"My ancestors paid with their blood to keep the Demons at bay,"
CS_CCE_C1_5_013,"and yet you still attempt to harm innocent civilians...!!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_014,"W...wait, you got it all wrong."
CS_CCE_C1_5_015,"I'm just trying to find people who will have nightmares, and swap those scary dreams for good and pleasant dreams!"
CS_CCE_C1_5_016,"Eh? You weren't just going to play pranks?"
CS_CCE_C1_5_017,"No! C'mon, I don't even have a Rudolph, so I can't participate normally."
CS_CCE_C1_5_018,"I just wanted to give presents to people in the way I'm best at, considering I'm a type of Dream Demon..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_019,"Eh...if that's the case..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_020,"Don't be fooled, Rephy. She's just playing you with her words."
CS_CCE_C1_5_021,"That's what Demons do best, after all. Fooling people with sweet words..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_022,"Well, I wouldn't deny that, at least in the case of Malduk and Angmund, but I..."
CS_CCE_C1_5_023,"Die, Demon!"
CS_CCE_C1_6_001,"How unfaaaaaaair!"
CS_CCE_C1_6_002,"Well, if she was just trying to stop people from having nightmares..."
CS_CCE_C1_6_003,"Perhaps what she was trying to do was noble, but her methods..."
CS_CCE_C1_6_004,"Right, people's lives could have been sucked dry..."
CS_CCE_C1_6_005,"Eh? Why would good dreams make people dry up?"
CS_CCE_C1_6_006,"CONVERSATION_SILENCE"
CS_CCE_C1_6_007,"Well, at least it wasn't a prank!"
CS_CCE_C1_6_008,"Next...let's go get Drunk Santa!!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_001,"Hohoho...*hic*! Ah, I haven't had a good drink in so long..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_002,"That huge barbarian keeled over a long time ago, what a pushover...hahaha..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_003,"Anyway, these clothes are really warm."
CS_CCE_C1_7_004,"I feel like I could just dig into the earth and go into hibernation wearing them....zzzzz...."
CS_CCE_C1_7_005,"Found you, Drunk Santa!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_006,"Yikes, you surprised me!!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_007,"I'm not drunk, anyway. I'm still sober!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_008,"I mean, I haven't drunk this much in a while, but still...*hic*"
CS_CCE_C1_7_009,"Ugh, you reek of alcohol!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_010,"What would the kids think! Go home and sleep it off already!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_011,"You don't have a Rudolph, so even if you look exactly like the Saint from the books, you can't participate!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_012,"Come to think of it, he really does look like the Saint."
CS_CCE_C1_7_013,"Aside from his height and size, anyway."
CS_CCE_C1_7_014,"The Saint in Red...who was that?"
CS_CCE_C1_7_015,"The books say he was a man who loved people more than anyone,"
CS_CCE_C1_7_016,"but hated Demons and 'Evil' more than anyone else."
CS_CCE_C1_7_017,"Some people think his clothes were red because they were stained in the blood of countless Demons."
CS_CCE_C1_7_018,"...That sounds more like a Hero, rather than a Saint."
CS_CCE_C1_7_019,"100 years ago, when my ancestors were fighting against the Demons,"
CS_CCE_C1_7_020,"perhaps the war would have gone better if we had more pople like him..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_021,"Ah, you mean that guy?"
CS_CCE_C1_7_022,"I did think these clothes looked like the ones Nicholas wore back in those days."
CS_CCE_C1_7_023,"Haha, the Slaughterer of Demons, the odd human from the Order of Lua, hailed as a Saint...what a funny joke, ahahaha..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_024,"Then there was Rudolph, eh? That gigantic reindeer that was as ripped as an ogre..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_025,"If I remember correctly, that reindeer didn't eat grass, but it ate Demons..."
CS_CCE_C1_7_026,"CONVERSATION_SILENCE"
CS_CCE_C1_7_027,"I don't care!"
CS_CCE_C1_7_028,"First, I'm going to have you go back to the Inn and sleep!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_001,"Zzzzz...."
CS_CCE_C1_8_002,"*pant pant*...How strong is this drunk Gramps, anyway?!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_003,"All those times he tried to accurately headbutt me...is this some kind of legendary Drunken Martial Arts?!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_004,"A Dwarf that knows of the Saint from 100 years ago..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_005,"It couldn't be...the King of Dwarves, one of the Hero's companions...?"
CS_CCE_C1_8_006,"...Most likely not. Dwarves all live far over 100 years, and the King wasn't the only one fighting a long ago..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_007,"Well, we can't just leave Gramps sleeping out in the snow!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_008,"I'll take him to the Inn!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_009,"Help me, Spirits!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_010,"...What a day."
CS_CCE_C1_8_011,"A lot happened, but we got our Rudolph."
CS_CCE_C1_8_012,"Now, we can participate in the event properly."
CS_CCE_C1_8_013,"Hopefully no other weird incidents happen."
CS_CCE_C1_8_014,"Ah, I hear fireworks from afar. Perhaps the festival has begun."
CS_CCE_C1_8_015,"We just need to wait for Rephy, and then..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_016,"*pant, pant*...I'm back! The event just started too, so I'll be a good Rudolph!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_017,"Also, I'm sorry to say..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_018,"There is a Santa-Rudolph duo hoarding the monster drops just as the festival began..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_019,"Hmm, they sound very capable."
CS_CCE_C1_8_020,"Yeah, they're catching all the monsters at a scary pace!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_021,"Although, I'm worried this might not leave much for the other Santas..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_022,"I see, then we have 2 options."
CS_CCE_C1_8_023,"First, we can go and stop the hoarders from getting everything,"
CS_CCE_C1_8_024,"or second, we can just go our way and try to catch some monsters on ourselves."
CS_CCE_C1_8_025,"Since those two aren't really breaking any rules, it's difficult..."
CS_CCE_C1_8_026,"still, this isn't a tournament, it's a festival. People should have fun together!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_027,"Still, no reason to fight between proper participants!"
CS_CCE_C1_8_028,"In the end, it's important that the children get their presents and are happy!"
E_S1_Main0_1,"Then, the next topic is the supervision of the Orvel Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main0_2,"The Orvel Summer Beach Festival is one of Orvel's 3 most popular festivals, with Halloween and Christmas being the other two."
E_S1_Main0_3,"But Your Highness, right now, we're dealing with the Demons and the Holy Sword that just have appeared."
E_S1_Main0_4,"I don't know if it's wise to hold such a big festival in a situation like this."
E_S1_Main0_5,"Hm, hm. As you all may know,"
E_S1_Main0_6,"the Orvel Summer Beach Festival is a major event held every year."
E_S1_Main0_7,"It's the only time of the year when anyone who's not a member of the royal family or an aristocrat can use the beach."
E_S1_Main0_8,"This festival also has great influence on Orvel's economy."
E_S1_Main0_9,"It's the only time when everyone can forget their worries and enjoy themselves."
E_S1_Main0_10,"Our people need this,"
E_S1_Main0_11,"especially in troubled times like this."
E_S1_Main0_12,"But Your Highness, are you sure you want to supervise the festival yourself?"
E_S1_Main0_13,"We can take care of it on our end."
E_S1_Main0_14,"I know you can, but I've made up my mind."
E_S1_Main0_15,"Events like this always attract unsavory people."
E_S1_Main0_16,"But you still don't have to do it. Honestly, I'm worried."
E_S1_Main0_17,"If something bad happens to you..."
E_S1_Main0_18,"Don't be."
E_S1_Main0_19,"I've fought beside you all this time."
E_S1_Main0_20,"Also, Chase will be with me. Won't you?"
E_S1_Main0_21,"I go where the Princess goes."
E_S1_Main0_22,"She doesn't really take care of herself."
E_S1_Main0_23,"That's why I have to take care of her."
E_S1_Main0_24,"Demia, Clause. You keep doing what you've been doing,"
E_S1_Main0_25,"maintaining public order in Orvel and keeping an eye on our neighbors and the Demons."
E_S1_Main0_26,"I doubt anything will happen, but report to me right away if something does."
E_S1_Main0_27,"As you command."
E_S1_Main0_28,"But Your Highness, Chase can only do so much."
E_S1_Main0_29,"You two might not be enough to handle everything."
E_S1_Main0_30,"I recommend you take a few soldiers with you."
E_S1_Main0_31,"Hm, you have a point."
E_S1_Main0_32,"But no soldiers."
E_S1_Main0_33,"This festival is supposed to help our people relax, and seeing soldiers will only do the opposite."
E_S1_Main0_34,"Then, who should I take?"
E_S1_Main0_35,"Ah, right! She can come with me."
E_S1_Main0_36,"She's always cooped up inside the castle."
E_S1_Main0_37,"This is a good opportunity to let her get some fresh air."
E_S1_Main0_38,"Huh? The Summer Festival?"
E_S1_Main0_39,"Hm... No, thanks. I'm too busy with my research."
E_S1_Main0_40,"If you need help, why don't you take some soldiers with you?"
E_S1_Main0_41,"We're worried that the sight of soldiers might not help the attendees relax."
E_S1_Main0_42,"I'm proposing this to you"
E_S1_Main0_43,"because you're perfect for this job, Annette."
E_S1_Main0_44,"Chase and I will oversee the festival."
E_S1_Main0_45,"All you have to do is just join the festival and help us sometimes."
E_S1_Main0_46,"And if you help me, I'll give you more research funds for the next 3 months."
E_S1_Main0_47,"Err?"
E_S1_Main0_48,"That's not all."
E_S1_Main0_49,"I've heard about your current experiment."
E_S1_Main0_50,"I know you're studying that human-type golem from an ancient technomagic civilization that was excavated."
E_S1_Main0_51,"You're trying to awaken its emotions, aren't you?"
E_S1_Main0_52,"How did you know? Heh heh."
E_S1_Main0_53,"But yes, Kara has a special function."
E_S1_Main0_54,"She generates electric signals similar to ours, though they're quite faint."
E_S1_Main0_55,"So, I've been teaching her human emotions."
E_S1_Main0_56,"I want to know how much more human she can become."
E_S1_Main0_57,"A festival involves a lot of people and interactions between them."
E_S1_Main0_58,"Don't you think it's a good opportunity to learn human emotions, especially happiness and excitement?"
E_S1_Main0_59,"Hm, that does sound interesting."
E_S1_Main0_60,"Alright, I'll come with you!"
E_S1_Main0_61,"I think experimenting in that sort of environment holds a lot of promise!"
E_S1_Main0_62,"She's really strange."
E_S1_Main0_63,"Why does it have to be her? I don't understand."
E_S1_Main0_64,"Ha ha. She may not look it, but she's Orvelia's most talented technomagi."
E_S1_Main0_65,"She's next to none when it comes to creative thinking."
E_S1_Main0_66,"Anything might happen during the festival. She'll be able to come up with a way to deal with anything we can't expect."
E_S1_Main0_67,"Now, the festival begins tomorrow."
E_S1_Main0_68,"I've prepared some clothes for you for this special occasion. Try them on later."
E_S1_Main0_69,"Clothes?"
E_S1_Main1_1,"Everyone's here."
E_S1_Main1_2,"How do you like your new clothes that I had May from the grocery store get for you?"
E_S1_Main1_3,"I feel defenseless in them."
E_S1_Main1_4,"Are they even practical?"
E_S1_Main1_5,"Cute! So cute!"
E_S1_Main1_6,"Heh heh! Kara, you look good in anything!"
E_S1_Main1_7,"Master, I don't understand the purpose of these clothes."
E_S1_Main1_8,"My body is perfectly waterproof..."
E_S1_Main1_9,"No, you don't have to worry about that."
E_S1_Main1_10,"You're a girl, and girls should look cute!"
E_S1_Main1_11,"Master, I'm a machine and technically have no gender..."
E_S1_Main1_12,"Just hush!"
E_S1_Main1_13,"*Ahem* Now, the first big event of this summer is..."
E_S1_Main1_14,"a large-scale barbecue party."
E_S1_Main1_15,"Ooh, are we eating meat?"
E_S1_Main1_16,"That's right. And many other kinds of delicious food."
E_S1_Main1_17,"It's going to be held here on the beach this afternoon."
E_S1_Main1_18,"It's called the Festival of Prosperity!"
E_S1_Main1_19,"The Festival of... Prosperity."
E_S1_Main1_20,"The festival staff will gather the ingredients during the day,"
E_S1_Main1_21,"and the cooks will prepare various foods with them in the afternoon."
E_S1_Main1_22,"The participants are free to do whatever they want. They can play at the beach or hunt to help the staff."
E_S1_Main1_23,"Of course, hunting is limited to a certain area."
E_S1_Main1_24,"We can't let the animals around here be hunted to extinction."
E_S1_Main1_25,"We're here..."
E_S1_Main1_26,"Why? Is there a problem?"
E_S1_Main1_27,"Mm. We don't know who they are yet, but I've got a report on them."
E_S1_Main1_28,"Some people have been overhunting in the designated hunting ground"
E_S1_Main1_29,"and poaching outside it."
E_S1_Main1_30,"And there's a farm that grows vegetables for the barbecue party,"
E_S1_Main1_31,"but someone stole vegetables from it."
E_S1_Main1_32,"This theft is not serious enough to affect the festival,"
E_S1_Main1_33,"but it can't go unpunished."
E_S1_Main1_34,"Do we need to go on watch duty?"
E_S1_Main1_35,"Ack, watch? But I'm not a soldier."
E_S1_Main1_36,"No! I'm here to do the experiment!"
E_S1_Main1_37,"*Chuckle* We didn't come here on this beautiful day to just stand in one place, keeping watch. We came to enjoy the Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main1_38,"And like I said before, Annette and Kara, you're free to do whatever you want."
E_S1_Main1_39,"I'll only contact you if I really need your help."
E_S1_Main1_40,"For now, let's split in groups of two and enjoy the festival like everyone else during the day."
E_S1_Main1_41,"And if we come across useful information, we can let each other know. Sound good?"
E_S1_Main1_42,"Yay! Yes, Your Highness!"
E_S1_Main1_43,"I'm going to the beach, of course! I'm not interested in hunting."
E_S1_Main1_44,"Alright, let's begin the experiment!"
E_S1_Main1_45,"Let's go, Kara! The sea is calling us!"
E_S1_Main1_46,"Master, you shouldn't run. It's too dangerous!"
E_S1_Main1_47,"They're gone already."
E_S1_Main1_48,"Hah hah. They're so enthusiastic, aren't they?"
E_S1_Main2_1,"Hm, do you see anything, Chase?"
E_S1_Main2_2,"I've been looking around the hunting ground, watching the participants."
E_S1_Main2_3,"So far, none of them seems particularly troublesome to me."
E_S1_Main2_4,"What about the farm?"
E_S1_Main2_5,"No, I didn't see anything in particular."
E_S1_Main2_6,"It's missing some onions, bell peppers, and other grilling vegetables,"
E_S1_Main2_7,"along with some other crops like carrots and corn."
E_S1_Main2_8,"About thirty servings' worth has been stolen,"
E_S1_Main2_9,"but that's not enough to affect the festival."
E_S1_Main2_10,"Hm, about thirty servings..."
E_S1_Main2_11,"The fact that there's a thief among us is a problem, even if we ignore any effect it might have on the festival."
E_S1_Main2_12,"It seems the number of game animals here has decreased."
E_S1_Main2_13,"The participants I met on my way here said that it takes a long time to find them."
E_S1_Main2_14,"I felt that way, too."
E_S1_Main2_15,"But none of the participants who are hunting right now"
E_S1_Main2_16,"is overhunting or poaching."
E_S1_Main2_17,"No one has hunted more animals than they're allowed."
E_S1_Main2_18,"I got it!"
E_S1_Main2_19,"Hm... Can't we eat this now?"
E_S1_Main2_20,"Not right now."
E_S1_Main2_21,"That would go against the spirit of this festival."
E_S1_Main2_22,"But everyone will be able to have their fill later."
E_S1_Main2_23,"Ho ho. You've got another."
E_S1_Main2_24,"Jane, could you put it in the ice box?"
E_S1_Main2_25,"...."
E_S1_Main2_26,"Are they Demons?"
E_S1_Main2_27,"They've got wings, but I'm not sure."
E_S1_Main2_28,"Hm... Well, they haven't caused trouble yet. Let's keep an eye on them for now."
E_S1_Main2_29,"Watch duty?"
E_S1_Main2_30,"Stop bringing up watch duty whenever there's a problem."
E_S1_Main2_31,"Hm... By the way, do you smell this?"
E_S1_Main2_32,"It's..."
E_S1_Main2_33,"It smells like grilled meat."
E_S1_Main2_34,"The party hasn't begun, though."
E_S1_Main2_35,"Let's go take a look."
E_S1_Main3_1,"Meanwhile..."
E_S1_Main3_2,"Oh, wow! It's the sea!"
E_S1_Main3_3,"Master, so what's this experiment you're talking about?"
E_S1_Main3_4,"Ah, that."
E_S1_Main3_5,"It's nothing. Just have fun, like ordinary people do!"
E_S1_Main3_6,"The experiment will be a success if you can have fun!"
E_S1_Main3_7,"Even if you can't have fun,"
E_S1_Main3_8,"I can use the data for my reference. It's a win-win situation for us!"
E_S1_Main3_9,"Analyzing how ordinary people have fun..."
E_S1_Main3_10,"Yaaaaap! Take this! Tsunami!"
E_S1_Main3_11,"W-wait. Arrgghh!"
E_S1_Main3_12,"Poof! Pooooof!"
E_S1_Main3_13,"This beach has good sand. It's the perfect place to have a sand bath."
E_S1_Main3_14,"Want me to cover you in sand? Should I go get a shovel?"
E_S1_Main3_15,"I can even call my pirates, and I'll bury you even deeper!"
E_S1_Main3_16,"Ordinary people?"
E_S1_Main3_17,"No. Useless samples."
E_S1_Main3_18,"Hm. There are so many weirdos in this country that it's going to be challenging to find normal examples."
E_S1_Main3_19,"Where can I find some other samples?"
E_S1_Main3_20,"Mm? Zafir, what are you making?"
E_S1_Main3_21,"This piece is... an ancient shrine."
E_S1_Main3_22,"Hm, you're as good with your hands as I remember."
E_S1_Main3_23,"Can you make something else?"
E_S1_Main3_24,"Hm... Then, how about a noble-looking sand cat...?"
E_S1_Main3_25,"Sonia, the ball went that way!"
E_S1_Main3_26,"Alright, my turn!"
E_S1_Main3_27,"Go, magic ball!"
E_S1_Main3_28,"Pfft, it's mine!"
E_S1_Main3_29,"Good job, Naila!"
E_S1_Main3_30,"Mm, they look mostly normal, but..."
E_S1_Main3_31,"No. They're too advanced for Kara."
E_S1_Main3_32,"Ha ha ha, this experiment isn't going to be easy."
E_S1_Main3_33,"But we're just getting started. I can do this!"
E_S1_Main3_34,"...?"
E_S1_Main3_35,"Now, how about we go where there are many people?"
E_S1_Main3_36,"Mm... Kara, scan for a crowd of people around us."
E_S1_Main3_37,"Activating heat sensor. Scanning for groups of heat sources..."
E_S1_Main3_38,"Multiple heat sources detected, approximately 1 kilometer away to the northeast."
E_S1_Main3_39,"Alright, let's go!"
E_S1_Main3_40,"Master, you don't have to hurry."
E_S1_Main4_1,"This... What's going on?"
E_S1_Main4_2,"I have no idea."
E_S1_Main4_3,"There, there! Gather around!"
E_S1_Main4_4,"I've got tons of meat! I, Viska, hunted it myself!"
E_S1_Main4_5,"If you want it, come get it!"
E_S1_Main4_6,"If you don't, I'm gonna eat it all!"
E_S1_Main4_7,"Ah, I've got some vegetables, too, if you like vegetables. They're not for me!"
E_S1_Main4_8,"Gagagagak... (Meat...)"
E_S1_Main4_9,"Gugagagak... (But no belly...)"
E_S1_Main4_10,"Gagak... (Can't eat...)"
E_S1_Main4_11,"Gughhh... (Can eat...)"
E_S1_Main4_12,"Gwogh... (But can't taste...)"
E_S1_Main4_13,"Why am I doing this?"
E_S1_Main4_14,"Why not? It's fun, isn't it?"
E_S1_Main4_15,"It's festival time. We Demons need to enjoy sometimes, too."
E_S1_Main4_16,"Of course, we can't ask those humans to include us in their festival."
E_S1_Main4_17,"That's why we're celebrating it on our own. Keh heh heh."
E_S1_Main4_18,"By the way, why do I have to be the cook?"
E_S1_Main4_19,"Why not? This could help improve your reputation among other Demons, you know."
E_S1_Main4_20,"The (former) Draconics General who sends her soldiers on free group vacations, and grills meat for them, too."
E_S1_Main4_21,"Maria's reputation can improve as well along the way."
E_S1_Main4_22,"Who knows? Your unit might end up becoming the Number One unit of the Dark Legion."
E_S1_Main4_23,"(Actually, I just didn't feel like grilling it myself!)"
E_S1_Main4_24,"Nonsense."
E_S1_Main4_25,"You're not even in the Dark Legion. You must have some hidden agenda to suggest things like that."
E_S1_Main4_26,"These ones aren't in the Dark Legion, either."
E_S1_Main4_27,"They're drifters, just like you."
E_S1_Main4_28,"Keh heh. You got me."
E_S1_Main4_29,"But come on, don't be like that."
E_S1_Main4_30,"Everyone's having fun. Can't you see?"
E_S1_Main4_31,"Mehhh. (I prefer grass over meat. Where are the grilled vegetables?)"
E_S1_Main4_32,"*Crunch*"
E_S1_Main4_33,"Charred meat."
E_S1_Main4_34,"The (former) General is not good at cooking."
E_S1_Main4_35,"...."
E_S1_Main4_36,"Alright, things are going as planned."
E_S1_Main4_37,"This meat imbued with strong energy should strengthen those who eat it."
E_S1_Main4_38,"I also marinated it with those blue potions. From the labels, they're May's EXP Potions."
E_S1_Main4_39,"Keep feeding it to weak Demons, and it should make them grow stronger!"
E_S1_Main4_40,"And in the end... I'm going to eat them all! Keh heh heh!"
E_S1_Main4_41,"Yes, this is my Demon Farm plan!"
E_S1_Main4_42,"......."
E_S1_Main4_43,"That'll definitely taste awful."
E_S1_Main4_44,"How did those Demons come here!?"
E_S1_Main4_45,"There are so many, as if someone opened a portal for them."
E_S1_Main4_46,"Ah, Annette and Kara."
E_S1_Main4_47,"...?!!!"
E_S1_Main4_48,"Err, what's this? I thought I saw a lot of people, but they're Demons?"
E_S1_Main4_49,"Well... we can always conduct a combat experiment instead. Kara!"
E_S1_Main4_50,"Entering Combat mode..."
E_S1_Main4_51,"Master, please step back."
E_S1_Main4_52,"...."
E_S1_Main4_53,"Princess...?"
E_S1_Main4_54,"Hm, I have no idea what's going on,"
E_S1_Main4_55,"but let's go help Annette for now!"
E_S1_Main4_56,"Let's go, Chase!"
E_S1_Main5_1,"Sheesh, even hellhounds deserve to eat in peace!"
E_S1_Main5_2,"I'm not even in the Dark Legion! Don't bother me!"
E_S1_Main5_3,"We heard you guys were having a meat party today. We like meat, too!"
E_S1_Main5_4,"Hm, you may not be in the Dark Legion,"
E_S1_Main5_5,"but I was told that red one is."
E_S1_Main5_6,"*Snort* I only serve Maria."
E_S1_Main5_7,"If you want to fight, I'll fight you, but there'll be no point to it."
E_S1_Main5_8,"I only came here because she threatened me."
E_S1_Main5_9,"If it weren't for her, I would be taking a stroll along the beach with Maria by now. Hmpf!"
E_S1_Main5_10,"Threatened you?"
E_S1_Main5_11,"I planned to enjoy a relaxing vacation with Maria,"
E_S1_Main5_12,"but then she said if I didn't help her, she wouldn't leave me alone all summer."
E_S1_Main5_13,"So what?"
E_S1_Main5_14,"Why can't you just help me!?"
E_S1_Main5_15,"I promised you that instead, I'd leave you alone for 2 months!"
E_S1_Main5_16,"You're the most delicious-looking thing here, but I'm still keeping my promise!"
E_S1_Main5_17,"*Sigh* This is our current situation."
E_S1_Main5_18,"Well, alright."
E_S1_Main5_19,"So, you were just enjoying some meat,"
E_S1_Main5_20,"and Annette instigated this hostility, I presume?"
E_S1_Main5_21,"Eh heh heh."
E_S1_Main5_22,"I thought it was a good opportunity to experiment."
E_S1_Main5_23,"You know what my dream is. I want to popularize a technomagic weapon for self-protection!"
E_S1_Main5_24,"Demons are Demons, our enemies."
E_S1_Main5_25,"Enemies are to be defeated."
E_S1_Main5_26,"That's not wrong, but..."
E_S1_Main5_27,"Gagagak... Gugagak... (Don't want to fight... The dead shouldn't work...)"
E_S1_Main5_28,"Gagagagigigik... (Worked enough for Malduk already...)"
E_S1_Main5_29,"Gagugagugak... (Got strange magic in return... being frozen or burned...)"
E_S1_Main5_30,"Ggghhhh.... (Just going to eat the meat...)"
E_S1_Main5_31,"Gwaaahhh... (Can't taste... but chew still...)"
E_S1_Main5_32,"Ehhh? (No intestines?)"
E_S1_Main5_33,"Mehhh? (More vegetables... No carrots?)"
E_S1_Main5_34,"I don't feel right about attacking these Demons."
E_S1_Main5_35,"*Sigh* How did this happen?"
E_S1_Main5_36,"Anyway, I'm glad you didn't steal enough food to put a halt to our festival."
E_S1_Main5_37,"I know, right?"
E_S1_Main5_38,"No discrimination against the Demons!"
E_S1_Main5_39,"I want to eat rice (souls) and meat!"
E_S1_Main5_40,"Well, alright. I can show some generosity to you, at least during this festival."
E_S1_Main5_41,"I'll let you Demons barbecue among yourselves, so long as you don't cause trouble to us humans."
E_S1_Main5_42,"In case you want more meat, I'll open a temporary hunting ground for you. Use it,"
E_S1_Main5_43,"and I expect you to refrain from hunting or stealing from outside it."
E_S1_Main5_44,"Yippee! I like you, human!"
E_S1_Main5_45,"Hm, this means we'll have to forget about the combat experiment."
E_S1_Main5_46,"But we can try something else!"
E_S1_Main5_47,"They can't enjoy themselves, eating such terrible-tasting meat."
E_S1_Main5_48,"Kara, now's the time for you to show off your skills as a court cook!"
E_S1_Main5_49,"Now, go!"
E_S1_Main5_50,"Entering Cooking mode..."
E_S1_Main5_51,"Completed calibrating the laser beam."
E_S1_Main5_52,"Initiating cooking..."
E_S1_Main5_53,"..."
E_S1_Main5_54,"*Mumble mumble*"
E_S1_Main5_55,"It's pretty good."
E_S1_Main5_56,"Princess, try it."
E_S1_Main5_57,"That machine cooks better than you do."
E_S1_Main5_58,"..."
E_S1_Main6_1,"Mm... Well, some strange stuff happened right on the first day,"
E_S1_Main6_2,"but the Demons left peacefully after eating their meat."
E_S1_Main6_3,"Nothing serious happened. Whew."
E_S1_Main6_4,"...."
E_S1_Main6_5,"Hah hah, ah hah hah hah."
E_S1_Main6_6,"I'm sorry you had to experience that on the first day, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main6_7,"By the way, Morrah was the cook..."
E_S1_Main6_8,"I'm sorry. I'll try to find out how they were able to sneak in."
E_S1_Main6_9,"Thank you, Demia."
E_S1_Main6_10,"Is there anything else we should know about, Your Highness?"
E_S1_Main6_11,"Aside from a Demon who had a stomachache from eating too much meat"
E_S1_Main6_12,"and a rabbit that showed up all of a sudden, taking away all the remaining vegetables, a lot of interesting things happened."
E_S1_Main6_13,"Still... I'm only thankful that the Festival of Prosperity in the afternoon was so successful."
E_S1_Main6_14,"Seeing how many unexpected things happened on the first day, I say we'd better stay on guard for the remainder of the festival."
E_S1_Main6_15,"I have a feeling things are going to be crazy until the end. *Chuckle*"
E_S1_Main6_16,"Then, Chase and I better go supervise the next event."
E_S1_Main6_17,"See you later, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main6_18,"*Ahem*"
E_S1_Main6_19,"I understand what we experienced yesterday was disconcerting,"
E_S1_Main6_20,"but today, another event takes place."
E_S1_Main6_21,"What is it today?"
E_S1_Main6_22,"I had fun yesterday. I'm really liking this festival thing!"
E_S1_Main6_23,"I hope it's something Kara can enjoy, too."
E_S1_Main6_24,"She can."
E_S1_Main6_25,"It's a water gun competition, open to people of all ages and genders."
E_S1_Main6_26,"Many talented gun-shooters from everywhere on the continent will also participate to show off their shooting skills in teams of 2 people."
E_S1_Main6_27,"It's called the Festival of Gun-shooting!"
E_S1_Main6_28,"Interesting."
E_S1_Main6_29,"What's the prize for the First Place winner?"
E_S1_Main6_30,"Mm, it's ten million Gold worth of..."
E_S1_Main6_31,"TEN MILLION GOLD!?"
E_S1_Main6_32,"Kara! Just for today,"
E_S1_Main6_33,"I've added the water gun feature to your optical weapon!"
E_S1_Main6_34,"Let's go!"
E_S1_Main6_35,"Victory is ours!"
E_S1_Main6_36,"I suppose money really talks."
E_S1_Main6_37,"Chase, don't you want to try?"
E_S1_Main6_38,"I'm not interested in money."
E_S1_Main6_39,"I'm content at the moment."
E_S1_Main6_40,"*Chuckle* I see."
E_S1_Main6_41,"Then, let's go, shall we?"
E_S1_Main7_1,"Hello, I'm May! I'll be the commentator during the Festival of Gun-shooting today."
E_S1_Main7_2,"Enjoy this event in which we'll find out who is Orvel's best water gun-shooting team!"
E_S1_Main7_3,"Thank you. And if you have time, feel free to visit the Grocery and buy many things!"
E_S1_Main7_4,"I'm with Gladi, the referee for the day. Gladi, wave your hand!"
E_S1_Main7_5,"Now, let me introduce the finalists of the day!"
E_S1_Main7_6,"Here we have the players who will join the battle royal of the day..."
E_S1_Main7_7,"Here's the first team!"
E_S1_Main7_8,"Coming from the freezing mountainous area, Windland,"
E_S1_Main7_9,"is the talented sniper, Rodina!"
E_S1_Main7_10,"And the cute rabbit girl, Luna!"
E_S1_Main7_11,"I'm going to buy lots of carrots with my prize money!"
E_S1_Main7_12,"By the way, that's not a water gun. Isn't that a water balloon slingshot?"
E_S1_Main7_13,"The referee says it doesn't matter, so long as I can drench people in water!"
E_S1_Main7_14,"They've got a cannon over there."
E_S1_Main7_15,"Now, for our second team!"
E_S1_Main7_16,"He likes anything that explodes!"
E_S1_Main7_17,"Lakrak, the goblin bomber!"
E_S1_Main7_18,"And the self-proclaimed Pirate Empress, Miruru!"
E_S1_Main7_19,"What!? No, I earned that title!"
E_S1_Main7_20,"I used to be a famous pirate in my time!"
E_S1_Main7_21,"Bwa hah, that not matter now!"
E_S1_Main7_22,"We get prize money and make big bomb!"
E_S1_Main7_23,"Our third team!"
E_S1_Main7_24,"They're a pair of ex-Navy soldiers from the distant Empire!"
E_S1_Main7_25,"The coldhearted bounty hunter, Crow!"
E_S1_Main7_26,"And the captain of the infamous Steel Wolf Mercenaries, Mitra!"
E_S1_Main7_27,"Hey, old man."
E_S1_Main7_28,"Doesn't this remind you of old times? Kya hah hah!"
E_S1_Main7_29,"*Sigh*"
E_S1_Main7_30,"I really want a smoke really bad, especially today."
E_S1_Main7_31,"Lastly,"
E_S1_Main7_32,"coming from the Orvel Castle herself,"
E_S1_Main7_33,"Royal Technomagi, Annette!"
E_S1_Main7_34,"And her assistant, Kara!"
E_S1_Main7_35,"Whoo! Hello, everyone!"
E_S1_Main7_36,"The prize money is mine. All of you can go home now!"
E_S1_Main7_37,"Master, please try not to say anything that can draw attention to us."
E_S1_Main7_38,"Everyone is looking at us because of what you just said."
E_S1_Main7_39,"Ah hah hah, really?"
E_S1_Main7_40,"Well, it's okay!"
E_S1_Main7_41,"Kara, you'll take care of them all, right?"
E_S1_Main7_42,"Activate Anti-personnel mode! Wipe the floor with them!"
E_S1_Main7_43,"Roger that, Master."
E_S1_Main8_1,"Mwa hah hah, take the water bombs!"
E_S1_Main8_2,"Bwa hah, see how long you avoid bomb!"
E_S1_Main8_3,"Miruru and Lakrak are shooting a volley of water bombs while the other players are fighting each other!"
E_S1_Main8_4,"The others are taking cover."
E_S1_Main8_5,"Let's see how they handle this situation."
E_S1_Main8_6,"*Exhale*"
E_S1_Main8_7,"Ugyak!"
E_S1_Main8_8,"Ah, Lakrak was hit by Rodina's snipe shot! But..."
E_S1_Main8_9,"I... count on... you!"
E_S1_Main8_10,"Don't worry!"
E_S1_Main8_11,"Let's go, Miruru Pirates!"
E_S1_Main8_12,"Oooohhhh!"
E_S1_Main8_13,"Gyagyagyak!"
E_S1_Main8_14,"An army of gnolls and goblins sprang out of the sand, shooting water bombs!"
E_S1_Main8_15,"Isn't this cheating?"
E_S1_Main8_16,"Referee Gladi, what do you think?"
E_S1_Main8_17,"..."
E_S1_Main8_18,"It looked awesome, so it's okay!"
E_S1_Main8_19,"What? Even the Referee!"
E_S1_Main8_20,"Pirates like don't care about the rules!"
E_S1_Main8_21,"Let's go, guys!"
E_S1_Main8_22,"Shoot them with water!"
E_S1_Main8_23,"Heeek!"
E_S1_Main8_24,"I can't hit each and every single one of them!"
E_S1_Main8_25,"Whoa, they're so many."
E_S1_Main8_26,"This is why I brought the carrots. Take this!"
E_S1_Main8_27,"Piong!"
E_S1_Main8_28,"???"
E_S1_Main8_29,"Kwaaakkk!"
E_S1_Main8_30,"YELP!"
E_S1_Main8_31,"Kyak!"
E_S1_Main8_32,"Ah! Miruru and her subordinates!"
E_S1_Main8_33,"The gigantic carrot-shaped water balloon that fell from the sky exploded, taking them all out!"
E_S1_Main8_34,"What a turn of events! Incredible!"
E_S1_Main8_35,"Oooh, that's amazing!"
E_S1_Main8_36,"Kara, can you do something like that?"
E_S1_Main8_37,"Scanning my functions..."
E_S1_Main8_38,"Master, I have yet to develop the ability to summon and drop carrots from the moon."
E_S1_Main8_39,"I'd better add that to your to-be-added function list!"
E_S1_Main8_40,"Wow, good job, Luna!"
E_S1_Main8_41,"Then, the next... kyaaaah!"
E_S1_Main8_42,"Don't take this personally."
E_S1_Main8_43,"You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
E_S1_Main8_44,"Keh heh heh, die! Die! DIE!"
E_S1_Main8_45,"Look at the barrage of water! Dozens of powerful water bullets are hitting where Rodina and Luna are hiding!"
E_S1_Main8_46,"They'll get hit if they take even a step away from where they are!"
E_S1_Main8_47,"Oooh, I don't think this can move."
E_S1_Main8_48,"Amazing, so amazing!"
E_S1_Main8_49,"Is this the technomagic of the Empire?"
E_S1_Main8_50,"I've heard it's been developing a weapon that combines technomagic and mechanical engineering."
E_S1_Main8_51,"Hmpf, stay hidden."
E_S1_Main8_52,"Yaaaaaah!"
E_S1_Main8_53,"Kyaaaa!"
E_S1_Main8_54,"Aaaaaah!"
E_S1_Main8_55,"The water! It drilled through the rock!"
E_S1_Main8_56,"Both Rodina and Luna,"
E_S1_Main8_57,"even though they were hiding behind a rock, got hit by the water cannon and eliminated!"
E_S1_Main8_58,"As the supervisor, I don't want to intervene,"
E_S1_Main8_59,"but don't you think those water guns are way too powerful?"
E_S1_Main8_60,"This year's festival is not going as smoothly as I thought."
E_S1_Main8_61,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that."
E_S1_Main9_1,"We're down to the final 2 teams!"
E_S1_Main9_2,"Crow reloads his weapon!"
E_S1_Main9_3,"Mitra gives him covering fire, keeping Kara and Annette at bay!"
E_S1_Main9_4,"Kya hah hah hah!"
E_S1_Main9_5,"Why don't you poke your head out a little bit?"
E_S1_Main9_6,"Come on, bring it on!"
E_S1_Main9_7,"Shut up, mongrel."
E_S1_Main9_8,"I only joined this competition because you wouldn't leave me alone if I didn't."
E_S1_Main9_9,"Stop annoying me, or you'll regret later."
E_S1_Main9_10,"Sorry, but I can't do that."
E_S1_Main9_11,"Whatever you say, old man, I'm not scared!"
E_S1_Main9_12,"You're not my boss anymore, anyway!"
E_S1_Main9_13,"Kyah hah hah! Die! Die! Die!"
E_S1_Main9_14,"Kara, can't you do something about that?"
E_S1_Main9_15,"It's time to show them whose weapon is superior."
E_S1_Main9_16,"Roger that."
E_S1_Main9_17,"Activating the water gun, a modified version of magic cannon..."
E_S1_Main9_18,"Initializing wide-area cannon..."
E_S1_Main9_19,"Kya hah hah. Mm?"
E_S1_Main9_20,"Lower your head, mongrel!"
E_S1_Main9_21,"Wow, that's impressive!"
E_S1_Main9_22,"Not as impressive as your Akistra, though!"
E_S1_Main9_23,"It's not recharged yet. I can't do what I did last time."
E_S1_Main9_24,"You'd better hide until then."
E_S1_Main9_25,"Good job, Kara!"
E_S1_Main9_26,"Now, it's time to retaliate. Go, cutie!"
E_S1_Main9_27,"!!!"
E_S1_Main9_28,"Switching to Siege mode..."
E_S1_Main9_29,"Initializing rapid shot..."
E_S1_Main9_30,"*Whistle* What an incredible rate of fire! Its firepower is also impressive!"
E_S1_Main9_31,"It can drill through rock. Can that actually kill us?"
E_S1_Main9_32,"Referee, isn't this cheating?"
E_S1_Main9_33,"Oh wait, then you would've been cheating, too, old man."
E_S1_Main9_34,"Booooo, cheaters! Why are you playing so dirty?"
E_S1_Main9_35,"..."
E_S1_Main10_1,"They're neck and neck with each other!"
E_S1_Main10_2,"Both teams have incredible rate of fire!"
E_S1_Main10_3,"Is this the power of technomagic?"
E_S1_Main10_4,"Referee, don't you think both teams are cheating at this point?"
E_S1_Main10_5,"This is fun! It's okay!"
E_S1_Main10_6,"The Referee says it's okay!"
E_S1_Main10_7,"By the way, Referee, despite the amount of water flying around, you're completely dry!"
E_S1_Main10_8,"*Chuckle* I'm called the Beast of the Arena for a reason."
E_S1_Main10_9,"This is a piece of cake!"
E_S1_Main10_10,"Kara, are you ready?"
E_S1_Main10_11,"I am, Master. I'm fully charged."
E_S1_Main10_12,"Initializing the siege water cannon..."
E_S1_Main10_13,"Old man, are you not ready yet?"
E_S1_Main10_14,"I am now. Get out of my way, mongrel!"
E_S1_Main10_15,"Haaaaaah!"
E_S1_Main10_16,"Fire."
E_S1_Main10_17,"I can't tell"
E_S1_Main10_18,"if this is a festival or a battlefield."
E_S1_Main10_19,"So much water..."
E_S1_Main10_20,"It's salty because it's seawater."
E_S1_Main10_21,"....."
E_S1_Main10_22,"You're calm despite the situation. I'm envious of you."
E_S1_Main10_23,"Anyway, I wonder who won."
E_S1_Main10_24,"So much water!"
E_S1_Main10_25,"I can't see anything!"
E_S1_Main10_26,"Who do you think won?"
E_S1_Main10_27,"The winning team... The winning team is... Err?"
E_S1_Main10_28,"Kara! Crow!"
E_S1_Main10_29,"Both are down!"
E_S1_Main10_30,"Now, it's only up to Mitra and Annette!"
E_S1_Main10_31,"I can't wait to see who wins!"
E_S1_Main10_32,"Ah, I give up."
E_S1_Main10_33,"?!?!?!?!?!"
E_S1_Main10_34,"Doing this without Kara is pointless. I mean, I'm here to do some experimenting."
E_S1_Main10_35,"Let's just call it a day. That was fun!"
E_S1_Main10_35_1,"Such a shame for the prize, but I can't help it!"
E_S1_Main10_36,"...."
E_S1_Main10_37,"Hey! You can't do that!"
E_S1_Main10_38,"Bring it on! I still want to play..."
E_S1_Main10_39,"...."
E_S1_Main10_40,"Misbehaving mongrels like you deserve a good beating."
E_S1_Main10_41,"*Gasp*"
E_S1_Main10_42,"Ah, wait... old man..."
E_S1_Main10_43,"Got a hit... in bread basket... *Passes out*"
E_S1_Main10_44,"Err... Mm..."
E_S1_Main10_45,"So! Today's winning team is Mitra and Crow!"
E_S1_Main10_46,"Medical Team, please come and carry away the wounded!"
E_S1_Main10_47,"Ho ho ho. Sure, give us a minute!"
E_S1_Main10_48,"*Sigh* I really want a smoke right now..."
E_S1_Main10_49,"Hm..."
E_S1_Main10_50,"At least, nothing that forced us to intervene happened,"
E_S1_Main10_51,"but maybe it's necessary to add some new rules to next year's Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main10_52,"We can't have people running around with deadly water guns."
E_S1_Main10_53,"Good idea."
E_S1_Main11_1,"I've got a report from the Medical Team."
E_S1_Main11_2,"Fortunately, no one got seriously wounded."
E_S1_Main11_3,"The one named Mitra got punched in the solar plexus by his own teammate, Crow, and was carted away."
E_S1_Main11_4,"That Crow looked pretty strong."
E_S1_Main11_5,"His weapon didn't look like a toy, either."
E_S1_Main11_6,"Getting punched by that fist would've knocked me out, too."
E_S1_Main11_7,"Things have been pretty hectic since the festival began."
E_S1_Main11_8,"But fortunately, today's event is relatively safe."
E_S1_Main11_9,"The Festival of Health. It's celebrated to wish everyone in Orvelia good health."
E_S1_Main11_10,"It's the day when beneficial herbs and other medicinal ingredients,"
E_S1_Main11_11,"and health foods made of such ingredients are being sold."
E_S1_Main11_12,"It's also the day that you can learn many things about medicine."
E_S1_Main11_13,"Oooh, how interesting!"
E_S1_Main11_14,"Most summer festivals are all about playing and having fun."
E_S1_Main11_15,"It's a big event among the kingdom's reputed alchemists, potion makers, and doctors."
E_S1_Main11_16,"It's a good chance to see extremely rare ingredients, too."
E_S1_Main11_17,"Clause told me about it."
E_S1_Main11_18,"He can't come because of his duties,"
E_S1_Main11_19,"so he asked me to get some ingredients for him."
E_S1_Main11_20,"He said he wants to give them to Orphanage Principal Ricardo."
E_S1_Main11_21,"Ricardo, the commander of the Holy Knights, is like a father to him."
E_S1_Main11_22,"This is so like Clause. *Chuckle*"
E_S1_Main11_23,"Master, why don't you take care of your health, too?"
E_S1_Main11_24,"You're always cooped up in your lab, working for hours without moving around much."
E_S1_Main11_25,"Unlike me, you're not a machine. Your body can break easily."
E_S1_Main11_26,"Don't worry."
E_S1_Main11_27,"I'm not that old yet!"
E_S1_Main11_28,"I'll drink more health drinks from now on."
E_S1_Main11_29,"If I break, you can fix me."
E_S1_Main11_30,"But if you break, I can't."
E_S1_Main11_31,"Ooh, Kara, are you worried about me?"
E_S1_Main11_32,"Have you learned what it's like to be worried?"
E_S1_Main11_33,"Worried?"
E_S1_Main11_34,"Mm... I'm not sure."
E_S1_Main11_35,"I just said what came to mind."
E_S1_Main11_36,"Is that called being worried?"
E_S1_Main11_37,"It seems her experiment is going well. *Chuckle*"
E_S1_Main11_38,"Now, then let's go check"
E_S1_Main11_39,"how well the festival is going."
E_S1_Main12_1,"Heh heh heh, it's finally the day."
E_S1_Main12_2,"Hah hah hah. That's right. We've been waiting so long."
E_S1_Main12_3,"The time has come for us to realize our dream!"
E_S1_Main12_4,"Are you done with your experiment?"
E_S1_Main12_5,"I heard you tried out a new test subject yesterday."
E_S1_Main12_6,"Ho ho ho. Yes, a really healthy test subject."
E_S1_Main12_7,"Ah, the experience is still fresh in my mind."
E_S1_Main12_8,"Zzz... Zzz..."
E_S1_Main12_9,"Oh, he's sleeping pretty peacefully, considering he got punched in the solar plexus."
E_S1_Main12_10,"Do you think he's recovered already?"
E_S1_Main12_11,"Let him sleep. He'll wake up on his own soon."
E_S1_Main12_12,"This is not the first time he got punched by me, and it won't be the last."
E_S1_Main12_13,"I'm leaving. I've got business to attend to."
E_S1_Main12_14,"Oh, aren't you going to stay until the end of the festival?"
E_S1_Main12_15,"Tomorrow is the Festival of Health."
E_S1_Main12_16,"You're holding candy in your mouth because you're trying to quit smoking, aren't you?"
E_S1_Main12_17,"Maybe you can find some herbs or foods that can help you with your withdrawal symptoms."
E_S1_Main12_18,"Not interested."
E_S1_Main12_19,"Smoking isn't the only reason"
E_S1_Main12_20,"I've got this candy in my mouth."
E_S1_Main12_21,"Oh, how disappointing!"
E_S1_Main12_22,"Ho ho ho. Now that the obstacle is gone,"
E_S1_Main12_23,"how about we move on to the next treatment (experiment)?"
E_S1_Main12_24,"Heh, so how did it go?"
E_S1_Main12_25,"He got very healthy and bolted out of here right away, of course."
E_S1_Main12_26,"Oh, but he might have been foaming at the mouth at the same time."
E_S1_Main12_27,"I don't think he'll experience serious side effects, though. Ho ho ho."
E_S1_Main12_28,"Well, since the medicine is based on the werewolf blood that Yanne got for me,"
E_S1_Main12_29,"he might become hyperactive or run after the moon for a little while."
E_S1_Main12_30,"Heh heh, then this is a huge success!"
E_S1_Main12_31,"Ah, I think I've heard you procured another valuable test subject."
E_S1_Main12_32,"Ah hah hah, that's..."
E_S1_Main13_1,"Ho ho ho ho ho!"
E_S1_Main13_2,"Half-human half-demon... Who knew I'd get ahold of such a precious test subject so easily?"
E_S1_Main13_3,"Hey! What the hell!?"
E_S1_Main13_4,"I followed you because you said you'd give me pudding."
E_S1_Main13_5,"Why are you doing this to me!?"
E_S1_Main13_6,"Ho ho, you had your pudding."
E_S1_Main13_7,"Now, it's time you helped me with my experiment."
E_S1_Main13_8,"Hey, but no needles!"
E_S1_Main13_9,"I hate needles!"
E_S1_Main13_10,"Mm... How about we draw some blood from you first?"
E_S1_Main13_11,"Your Half-Demon blood will be a very valuable test material."
E_S1_Main13_12,"Aww! Hey! No! Take that away!"
E_S1_Main13_13,"This human is killing a Half-Demon! Help! Someone save this Half-Demon!"
E_S1_Main13_14,"Ho ho ho. It won't hurt."
E_S1_Main13_15,"It might sting a little bit at first."
E_S1_Main13_16,"Excuse me."
E_S1_Main13_17,"Mm? Did something pass us by?"
E_S1_Main13_18,"Huh? If it did, I didn't see it."
E_S1_Main13_19,"Epis! Where are you...?"
E_S1_Main13_20,"Mm?"
E_S1_Main13_21,"Ezekiel? What are you doing here?"
E_S1_Main13_22,"Oh, do you know him?"
E_S1_Main13_23,"Bah, couldn't you come earlier?"
E_S1_Main13_24,"Do something about this crazy woman!"
E_S1_Main13_25,"She keeps trying to draw my blood!"
E_S1_Main13_26,"Crazy woman? Oh, that's hurtful."
E_S1_Main13_27,"I just want to draw some blood for testing purposes."
E_S1_Main13_28,"Half-Demon blood is rare, so it's a very precious research material."
E_S1_Main13_29,"I hate needles!"
E_S1_Main13_30,"*Sigh* Fine."
E_S1_Main13_31,"How about I give you another cup of pudding? Will you let me?"
E_S1_Main13_32,"...!!!"
E_S1_Main13_33,"...."
E_S1_Main13_34,"Two. If you give two..."
E_S1_Main13_35,"Good."
E_S1_Main13_36,"*Sigh* Just get it over with, Ezekiel."
E_S1_Main13_37,"Epis just passed by."
E_S1_Main13_38,"We'd better go after her."
E_S1_Main13_39,"Hey."
E_S1_Main13_40,"Mm?"
E_S1_Main13_41,"I know you want to find her, but we're at a festival."
E_S1_Main13_42,"And festivals are supposed to be enjoyed. Even I know that."
E_S1_Main13_43,"But..."
E_S1_Main13_44,"That succubus probably came here to enjoy the festival, too. You know her."
E_S1_Main13_45,"And she's not going to go anywhere soon."
E_S1_Main13_46,"Who knows? She might be dancing with your lady happily somewhere."
E_S1_Main13_47,"..."
E_S1_Main13_48,"Just relax, dude."
E_S1_Main13_49,"I'll let you have one of my pudding cups."
E_S1_Main13_50,"Let's eat them and enjoy this festival for now."
E_S1_Main13_51,"Alright."
E_S1_Main13_52,"Err? Is it done already?"
E_S1_Main13_53,"Yes. You may leave now."
E_S1_Main13_54,"As a doctor, I don't lie to my patients."
E_S1_Main13_55,"Here, I'll put your pudding in your bag. Enjoy it."
E_S1_Main13_56,"Yippee! Pudding time!"
E_S1_Main13_57,"Wait, Ezekiel!"
E_S1_Main13_58,"Ho ho ho. Precious Half-Demon blood..."
E_S1_Main13_59,"I can't wait to make potions with this blood charged with powerful mana."
E_S1_Main13_60,"Replace the werewolf blood with the Half-Demon blood... And a little bit of belladonna... Oops, where did the time go?"
E_S1_Main13_61,"I'd better call it a day now."
E_S1_Main13_62,"Ho ho ho. Has everyone gone?"
E_S1_Main13_63,"Jane! Wake up. Let's go to the night market."
E_S1_Main13_64,"Let's go get some snacks."
E_S1_Main13_65,"Ooh..."
E_S1_Main13_66,"I see. I was curious how you got ahold of that Half-Demon blood since it's pretty hard to get."
E_S1_Main13_67,"Could you give me some of it later? Heh heh heh."
E_S1_Main13_68,"Sure thing. Ho ho ho."
E_S1_Main13_69,"It was because of you I could make such great potions for this year's festival."
E_S1_Main13_70,"This is all for the sake of..."
E_S1_Main13_71,"transforming poison into a world-class medicine!"
E_S1_Main14_1,"Hm, everything looks fine."
E_S1_Main14_2,"By the way, Annette, you bought so many potions."
E_S1_Main14_3,"Why do you need so many?"
E_S1_Main14_4,"I can go through them in a few days if I stay up all night, working."
E_S1_Main14_5,"I stock up on them whenever I can, to save money."
E_S1_Main14_6,"I hate it when I get a great idea in the middle of the night, but I can't try it because I'm tired."
E_S1_Main14_7,"Hm, what if you overdose on them?"
E_S1_Main14_8,"I've tested and verified that one cannot overdose on May's special potions."
E_S1_Main14_9,"You also cannot be poisoned by them."
E_S1_Main14_10,"I didn't know you gave her a feature to detect poison."
E_S1_Main14_11,"Oh, I never added that. It was one of her original features."
E_S1_Main14_12,"Mm, the last place to shop today is over there."
E_S1_Main14_13,"This is where the Medical Team's tents are."
E_S1_Main14_14,"Ah, there's a small stall in front of one."
E_S1_Main14_15,"Hello, hello!"
E_S1_Main14_16,"Welcome to Requina's General Store!"
E_S1_Main14_17,"I've got nothing but a wide collection of health products for today's festival."
E_S1_Main14_18,"Feel free to take a look around!"
E_S1_Main14_19,"!!!"
E_S1_Main14_20,"Be careful."
E_S1_Main14_21,"That poison is toxic."
E_S1_Main14_22,"Ah, that one over there, too."
E_S1_Main14_23,"That, that, and that, too."
E_S1_Main14_24,"Err? Are you buggy?"
E_S1_Main14_25,"I've had a lot of health drinks and medicines Requina prepared before,"
E_S1_Main14_26,"and I've never had a problem with them."
E_S1_Main14_27,"In fact, they work better than the others I tried!"
E_S1_Main14_28,"Are these strange-colored potions health drinks?"
E_S1_Main14_29,"Yes! They taste peculiar, and may make you feel a weird kind of tingly, but..."
E_S1_Main14_30,"The taste grows on you!"
E_S1_Main14_31,"Why don't you take a sip yourself? Heh heh."
E_S1_Main14_32,"...."
E_S1_Main14_33,"!!!!"
E_S1_Main14_34,"Chase! Are you okay, Chase?"
E_S1_Main14_35,"P-Princess..."
E_S1_Main14_36,"It's... delicious! Very much so!"
E_S1_Main14_37,"...."
E_S1_Main14_38,"Heh heh. Requina's General Store exists to promulgate the usefulness of poisons."
E_S1_Main14_39,"Poisons work differently, depending on the user."
E_S1_Main14_40,"They're used for assassination and other unsavory purposes, of course, but when used carefully, they can be as beneficial as medicinal herbs."
E_S1_Main14_41,"In fact, since they consist of substances unfamiliar to our bodies, they are absorbed quickly and provide more powerful effects than herbs."
E_S1_Main14_42,"Hm, I don't think I know exactly what you're saying, but..."
E_S1_Main14_43,"Healthy poisons? That's pretty strange."
E_S1_Main14_44,"There's also a new product that Mediana in the Medical Team and I have developed together!"
E_S1_Main14_45,"This is a good opportunity, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main14_46,"How'd you like to sample this freshly launched new product?"
E_S1_Main14_47,"This potion contains the blood of a half-human half-demon,"
E_S1_Main14_48,"and that combination of two conflicting energies generates explosive power, along with a healthy poison."
E_S1_Main14_49,"You can't find this new product anywhere else. Ho ho ho."
E_S1_Main14_50,"Hm."
E_S1_Main14_51,"Are you sure it's safe?"
E_S1_Main14_52,"The people over there just drank it."
E_S1_Main14_53,"Look how healthy they are!"
E_S1_Main14_54,"!?*@&!?*@&!?*@&"
E_S1_Main14_55,"You think they're healthy?"
E_S1_Main14_56,"They're so healthy that they can't stop moving."
E_S1_Main14_57,"It's okay, Your Highness. Moving so vigorously and sweating so profusely"
E_S1_Main14_58,"helps promote good health!"
E_S1_Main14_59,"Ho ho... Ho ho ho... Then, thank you for participating in our experiment."
E_S1_Main14_60,"Come on, Your Highness. It'll make you feel good. Heh heh heh..."
E_S1_Main14_61,"S-stop!"
E_S1_Main14_62,"I don't like that look in your eyes!"
E_S1_Main15_1,"*Huff, huff...*"
E_S1_Main15_2,"Are you alright, Princess?"
E_S1_Main15_3,"Yes, but..."
E_S1_Main15_4,"What about you? You took a few more sips while trying to protect me."
E_S1_Main15_5,"Mm...?"
E_S1_Main15_6,"I'm good."
E_S1_Main15_7,"Actually, I've never felt so good before in my life."
E_S1_Main15_8,"I told you, it's safe for the strong-minded, Your Highness."
E_S1_Main15_9,"Ah, but it might be different in his case."
E_S1_Main15_10,"He might be suppressing the potion's effects simply by brute strength."
E_S1_Main15_11,"Excuse me, but how'd you like to participate in my other experiments?"
E_S1_Main15_12,"I refuse."
E_S1_Main15_13,"My duty is to protect the Princess."
E_S1_Main15_14,"Oh, that's a bit disappointing. Ho ho ho..."
E_S1_Main15_15,"*Sigh* You could've made an interesting research subject..."
E_S1_Main15_16,"If Chase is okay, then so should I!"
E_S1_Main15_17,"My stomach is used to many different types of health drinks, anyway!"
E_S1_Main15_18,"Master, that's 100% pure toxin."
E_S1_Main15_19,"It's dangerous to ingest..."
E_S1_Main15_20,"*Gulp*"
E_S1_Main15_21,"!!!!"
E_S1_Main15_22,"...."
E_S1_Main15_23,"Mm? It's delicious! So sweet!"
E_S1_Main15_24,"Ooh, I can feel the power flowing in me!"
E_S1_Main15_25,"Ah, I don't have time for this. The lab! Yes, I must go to the lab!"
E_S1_Main15_26,"Kara, let's go back to our lab! I've got a new experiment to work on!"
E_S1_Main15_27,"Yippee!"
E_S1_Main15_28,"She's strong-minded, but in a different sense."
E_S1_Main15_29,"In a way, she resembles Mediana, too."
E_S1_Main15_30,"*Sigh...*"
E_S1_Main16_1,"*Ahem*"
E_S1_Main16_2,"Every day has been mayhem since the festival began,"
E_S1_Main16_3,"and somehow we've come this far."
E_S1_Main16_4,"It's the 4th night. The highlight of the Summer Festival. It's a special event that's perfect for a hot night."
E_S1_Main16_5,"A spooky walking course to test your bravery!"
E_S1_Main16_6,"Bravery?"
E_S1_Main16_7,"Bravery."
E_S1_Main16_8,"Courageous behavior or character."
E_S1_Main16_9,"One's ability to overcome fear and stay calm..."
E_S1_Main16_10,"A-ahem!"
E_S1_Main16_11,"The dictionary feature I added the other day is working well. Ah hah hah hah..."
E_S1_Main16_12,"Master, you shouldn't keep adding all kinds of features to my body..."
E_S1_Main16_13,"Anyway, tonight's bravery test will be taken by groups of people,"
E_S1_Main16_14,"just like the water gun competition two days ago."
E_S1_Main16_15,"There are multiple entrances. We should go in through different entrances,"
E_S1_Main16_16,"and meet after the bravery test."
E_S1_Main16_17,"A-are we doing this in teams of two again?"
E_S1_Main16_18,"Hm... Then, can my team spook the people instead?"
E_S1_Main16_19,"I want to see how well Kara can spook people."
E_S1_Main16_20,"Mm, that role is already filled."
E_S1_Main16_21,"I'm sorry, but we can't do that."
E_S1_Main16_22,"For now, join the event as normal participants to monitor it."
E_S1_Main16_23,"Gah!"
E_S1_Main16_24,"Th-then, I'll collect data that way!"
E_S1_Main16_25,"I can find out how to spook Kara, for instance."
E_S1_Main16_26,"I'm a machine. I do not think I am capable of being frightened..."
E_S1_Main16_27,"Am I wrong if I think Annette is moving faster than usual?"
E_S1_Main16_28,"Mm. She looks like she's in a hurry for some reason."
E_S1_Main16_29,"She's excited, maybe?"
E_S1_Main16_30,"Ho ho ho. I disagree."
E_S1_Main16_31,"At least, one of us is going to enjoy the festival tonight."
E_S1_Main17_1,"It's dark, so dark!"
E_S1_Main17_2,"How long do I have to walk?"
E_S1_Main17_3,"Master, what is it like to be scared?"
E_S1_Main17_4,"Scared? Ah, you mean fear."
E_S1_Main17_5,"I can't tell you because I'm not scared."
E_S1_Main17_6,"I-in fact, I can't wait to see how they're going to try to scare me!"
E_S1_Main17_7,"So, you're not agitated. You're excited because of your curiosity, Master?"
E_S1_Main17_8,"Huh? S-sure, you can say that!"
E_S1_Main17_9,"Heeek! There's something faint over there!"
E_S1_Main17_10,"..."
E_S1_Main17_11,"...??"
E_S1_Main17_12,"Mm, what is this?"
E_S1_Main17_13,"..."
E_S1_Main17_14,"*Mumble mumble*"
E_S1_Main17_15,"It's mumbling something."
E_S1_Main17_16,"*Sigh* This happens all the time."
E_S1_Main17_17,"I'm either exorcised or purified,"
E_S1_Main17_18,"even though I did nothing wrong to humans."
E_S1_Main17_19,"Enough is enough!"
E_S1_Main17_20,"Enng? Err? Nngg?"
E_S1_Main17_21,"No... A real ghost!?"
E_S1_Main17_22,"Hah hah, hah hah hah. This is a trick, right?"
E_S1_Main17_23,"There's no way such an unscientific thing can happen, right?"
E_S1_Main17_24,"Analyzing..."
E_S1_Main17_25,"I don't detect any vital energy from it. Or magical traces."
E_S1_Main17_26,"Constituents: Ectoplasm. This is a real ghost."
E_S1_Main17_27,"Heeeeek!?"
E_S1_Main17_28,"Kwaakkk! Enough is enough!"
E_S1_Main17_29,"Tonight, we're taking our revenge!"
E_S1_Main17_30,"We'll make the humans pay for ignoring and mistreating us!"
E_S1_Main17_31,"Starting with you!"
E_S1_Main17_32,"Wagggghhhh!"
E_S1_Main17_33,"Kyaaaak!"
E_S1_Main17_34,"Are you scared, Master?"
E_S1_Main17_35,"Of course, I am!"
E_S1_Main17_36,"It's a ghost! A ghost!"
E_S1_Main17_37,"Is it your fear that's making your energy circulate so rapidly?"
E_S1_Main17_38,"Recording this in my database..."
E_S1_Main17_39,"I experiment on you, not the other way around!"
E_S1_Main18_1,"Kyaaaak!"
E_S1_Main18_2,"Mm, everyone seems to be having fun."
E_S1_Main18_3,"By the way, there's nothing much going on here."
E_S1_Main18_4,"We met a few people in monster costumes on our way here,"
E_S1_Main18_5,"and for some reason, they avoided us."
E_S1_Main18_6,"I think I know why."
E_S1_Main18_7,"?"
E_S1_Main18_8,"Nothing."
E_S1_Main18_9,"Mm? I see something over there. Other participants, maybe."
E_S1_Main18_10,"Bah, this is boring. I had much more fun barbecuing."
E_S1_Main18_11,"It's no surprise, though. Nothing can scare great Demon Viska."
E_S1_Main18_12,"I agree. I don't think there's anything that can scare you Demons."
E_S1_Main18_13,"By the way, I've got a question."
E_S1_Main18_14,"That power in your right arm..."
E_S1_Main18_15,"Where did you get it?"
E_S1_Main18_16,"Hm, so you want to know about my arm?"
E_S1_Main18_17,"Well, alright, I'll tell you."
E_S1_Main18_18,"It's the power of the cursed blood"
E_S1_Main18_19,"of the great Demon Lucikiel!"
E_S1_Main18_20,"..."
E_S1_Main18_21,"What about you? That arm of yours is radiating some potent darkness energy."
E_S1_Main18_22,"Ah, it's the eye of the ancient monster that faces the truth."
E_S1_Main18_23,"I once looked into the Abyss for the sake of my revenge."
E_S1_Main18_24,"And it looked into me, too."
E_S1_Main18_25,"..."
E_S1_Main18_26,"Geez, good for you."
E_S1_Main18_27,"Men are attracted to darkness."
E_S1_Main18_28,"Whatever!"
E_S1_Main18_29,"Let's go farther."
E_S1_Main18_30,"I'm not ready to quit, just yet."
E_S1_Main18_31,"...."
E_S1_Main18_32,"Demons!"
E_S1_Main18_33,"Kyaaaak!"
E_S1_Main18_34,"Geez, you startled..."
E_S1_Main18_35,"Ack, Angels!"
E_S1_Main18_36,"Whoa, let's run!"
E_S1_Main18_37,"They're not edible, smell like doves, and they're extremely annoying!"
E_S1_Main18_38,"..."
E_S1_Main18_39,"Waaaah!"
E_S1_Main18_40,"Stop attacking! This is unfair!"
E_S1_Main18_41,"I'm not even a Demon... Wah!"
E_S1_Main18_42,"Even if you're a dweller of the earth, you've been tainted by darkness. You are to be exterminated!"
E_S1_Main18_43,"Stop running and fight us, Demons!"
E_S1_Main18_44,"...."
E_S1_Main18_45,"Did we hire Angels"
E_S1_Main18_46,"to scare any Demons that might decide to join this event?"
E_S1_Main18_47,"If we did, I didn't know about it."
E_S1_Main19_1,"We lost them."
E_S1_Main19_2,"I don't know what kind of special occasion tonight is, but that anonymous tip was authentic."
E_S1_Main19_3,"A day when evil spirits come out to play. This must be Halloween."
E_S1_Main19_4,"I think you're right, Arch."
E_S1_Main19_5,"How many do you see?"
E_S1_Main19_6,"According to the eye I've planted in the sky,"
E_S1_Main19_7,"almost none of the entities here are powerful enough to warrant our attention."
E_S1_Main19_8,"Those fleeing Demons are probably the strongest."
E_S1_Main19_9,"The rest are as strong as ordinary humans."
E_S1_Main19_10,"By the way, don't the ghosts here look strange to you?"
E_S1_Main19_11,"I tried to purify them with rays of the sun,"
E_S1_Main19_12,"but it didn't work, strangely enough."
E_S1_Main19_13,"Are you seeing what I'm seeing?"
E_S1_Main19_14,"I don't know how many times I've asked this question since the beginning of the Summer Festival this year."
E_S1_Main19_15,"I can see what you're seeing, Princess."
E_S1_Main19_16,"The Angels are attacking the people in monster costumes to purify them."
E_S1_Main19_17,"..."
E_S1_Main19_18,"First it was the Demons, and now it's the Angels."
E_S1_Main19_19,"Entities from other worlds are troublesome."
E_S1_Main19_20,"What's common sense to us just goes over their heads."
E_S1_Main19_21,"...."
E_S1_Main19_22,"I don't want to fight the Angels,"
E_S1_Main19_23,"but we have no choice."
E_S1_Main19_24,"Let's stop them for now. We can talk afterward."
E_S1_Main20_1,"This must be your first time to join a human festival."
E_S1_Main20_2,"It's not Halloween. It's the Festival of Bravery, one of many events included in our Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main20_3,"They're neither Demons nor evil spirits; they're humans."
E_S1_Main20_4,"Please don't be so rough with them."
E_S1_Main20_5,"*Ahem* We made a mistake, human princess."
E_S1_Main20_6,"We didn't know this was a festival."
E_S1_Main20_7,"But there were Demons and some others that have their power."
E_S1_Main20_8,"I'm not trying to take sides with the Demons, but they said they were not in the Dark Legion."
E_S1_Main20_9,"They were only here to enjoy the festival."
E_S1_Main20_10,"They didn't hurt any of my people."
E_S1_Main20_11,"I'd like to ask you to refrain from any act of hostility, at least for the duration of this festival."
E_S1_Main20_12,"So, you want peace during the festival."
E_S1_Main20_13,"I understand, human princess."
E_S1_Main20_14,"This is your country."
E_S1_Main20_15,"It's only right that we follow your rules."
E_S1_Main20_16,"Understood."
E_S1_Main20_17,"Mm? The Eye of Heaven has detected something..."
E_S1_Main20_18,"A tremendous amount of spiritual energy!? It's coming our way!"
E_S1_Main20_19,"?!"
E_S1_Main20_20,"Kyaaaak!"
E_S1_Main20_21,"NOOOOO!"
E_S1_Main20_22,"Kyaaaaaaahhh... (Monotonous)"
E_S1_Main20_23,"Are you making fun of me now, Kara!?"
E_S1_Main20_24,"Not at all, Master."
E_S1_Main20_25,"I was only trying to study fear."
E_S1_Main20_26,"I think you are!"
E_S1_Main20_27,"I'm only mimicking you."
E_S1_Main20_28,"I've been recording data."
E_S1_Main20_29,"Stop experimenting on me!"
E_S1_Main20_30,"Real ghosts!?"
E_S1_Main20_31,"Where did they come from?"
E_S1_Main20_32,"It's one thing after another with this year's festival. *Sigh*"
E_S1_Main20_33,"I can't protect you against your own mental stress, Princess."
E_S1_Main20_34,"I'm sorry."
E_S1_Main20_35,"It's not your fault, Chase."
E_S1_Main20_36,"Can we take care of that evil spirit, Princess?"
E_S1_Main20_37,"Yes, you can. Thank you."
E_S1_Main21_1,"Demons, Angels, and now an army of ghosts that came out of nowhere."
E_S1_Main21_2,"This year's festival is really eventful."
E_S1_Main21_3,"Whew, that scared the hell out of me."
E_S1_Main21_4,"Who knew real ghosts were there?"
E_S1_Main21_5,"By the way, those ghosts weren't part of the plan, were they?"
E_S1_Main21_6,"I don't know if this was a prank or not,"
E_S1_Main21_7,"but let's collect ourselves and prepare for the next event."
E_S1_Main21_8,"The main event for today also takes place at night."
E_S1_Main21_9,"It's a full-scale fireworks show,"
E_S1_Main21_10,"called the Festival of Fireworks!"
E_S1_Main21_11,"Ah, fireworks?"
E_S1_Main21_12,"Like we did in the beginning of this year?"
E_S1_Main21_13,"I loved them so much that I added them to Kara."
E_S1_Main21_14,"I wonder what you didn't add to Kara."
E_S1_Main21_15,"By the way, I really hope nothing bad will happen tonight..."
E_S1_Main21_16,"Your Highness! Your Highness! Bad news!"
E_S1_Main21_17,"Mm? What is it?"
E_S1_Main21_18,"The fireworks and extra explosives we prepared for tonight's fireworks show..."
E_S1_Main21_19,"They've been stolen!"
E_S1_Main21_20,"..."
E_S1_Main21_21,"Now I'm convinced that Lua has cursed this year's festival."
E_S1_Main21_22,"Cheer up, Princess."
E_S1_Main21_23,"We'll be able to handle this as well."
E_S1_Main22_1,"Traces of wheels, but of no hooves."
E_S1_Main22_2,"The thieves used some form of mechanical transport to move them."
E_S1_Main22_3,"There are footprints, too."
E_S1_Main22_4,"Small footprints... Possibly of young humans or of a different race."
E_S1_Main22_5,"Aren't they goblins'?"
E_S1_Main22_6,"I've heard more goblins live in the King's Plains than we think."
E_S1_Main22_7,"You may be right."
E_S1_Main22_8,"But it's hard to believe that ordinary goblins came this far,"
E_S1_Main22_9,"put our guards to sleep, and left with such a large amount of"
E_S1_Main22_10,"explosives and fireworks."
E_S1_Main22_11,"According to my database, the goblins have a penchant for explosives."
E_S1_Main22_12,"That's good enough reason for them to steal ours."
E_S1_Main22_13,"And this wheel marking..."
E_S1_Main22_14,"It's in my database."
E_S1_Main22_15,"I've seen it during the water gun competition on the second day of the festival."
E_S1_Main22_16,"Oh, that girl who carried the cannon with her, right?"
E_S1_Main22_17,"The self-proclaimed Pirate Empress."
E_S1_Main22_18,"Hm, judging by the spacing of the wheels, I think you're right."
E_S1_Main22_19,"Then, the thieves are that girl named Miruru"
E_S1_Main22_20,"and her goblin partner, Lakrak."
E_S1_Main22_21,"But why?"
E_S1_Main23_1,"Bwa hah! Good explosives!"
E_S1_Main23_2,"I can make best bomb with them!"
E_S1_Main23_3,"Keh heh heh. Good!"
E_S1_Main23_4,"I'll show you the power from my past,"
E_S1_Main23_5,"Miruru's custom cannon, Leviathan Mark 2!"
E_S1_Main23_6,"You good human!"
E_S1_Main23_7,"No human loves bomb is bad!"
E_S1_Main23_8,"I wish Roi love bomb like you!"
E_S1_Main23_9,"Roi? That name sounds familiar..."
E_S1_Main23_10,"Err, whatever. It can't be important."
E_S1_Main23_11,"Come on, let's make bombs!"
E_S1_Main23_12,"That must be them."
E_S1_Main23_13,"What are they doing?"
E_S1_Main23_14,"A gigantic cannon."
E_S1_Main23_15,"And a mountain of bombs."
E_S1_Main23_16,"Kara, activate your night vision and zoom in on them."
E_S1_Main23_17,"See anything?"
E_S1_Main23_18,"Activating night vision. Zooming in..."
E_S1_Main23_19,"I see them."
E_S1_Main23_20,"They're putting the explosives and fireworks into something that looks like a gigantic clay ball."
E_S1_Main23_21,"Judging by the fuse on the side of the ball, I believe it's an oversized bomb."
E_S1_Main23_22,"So, they're making oversized bombs."
E_S1_Main23_23,"Whatever their reason is,"
E_S1_Main23_24,"we should stop them first!"
E_S1_Main24_1,"Woo hee, woo hee hee! It's ready."
E_S1_Main24_2,"Right! Kuhehek! Finally it's completed!"
E_S1_Main24_3,"Now load these bombs in Leviathan Mark 2 and shoot them at once..."
E_S1_Main24_4,"Humans in Orvel Castle will be so surprised! Bwa hah!"
E_S1_Main24_5,"Halt!"
E_S1_Main24_6,"Ugyak!?"
E_S1_Main24_7,"Ack? What? What?"
E_S1_Main24_8,"You're under arrest for stealing those explosives and fireworks."
E_S1_Main24_9,"Don't move."
E_S1_Main24_10,"Gyaaak! Screw you!"
E_S1_Main24_11,"No one can stop our experiment!"
E_S1_Main24_12,"He's right!"
E_S1_Main24_13,"This is a crucial moment, so don't interfere!"
E_S1_Main24_14,"We're about to rewrite the history of bombs!"
E_S1_Main24_15,"Okay, what kind of experiment is it?"
E_S1_Main24_16,"Not going to tell you!"
E_S1_Main24_17,"It's confidential!"
E_S1_Main24_18,"Oh, come on."
E_S1_Main24_19,"You're trying to blow something off, right?"
E_S1_Main24_20,"No means no!"
E_S1_Main24_21,"Where's the fun in telling you?"
E_S1_Main24_22,"She's right. No fun telling you!"
E_S1_Main24_23,"Even if this is going to be the world's biggest explosion!"
E_S1_Main24_24,"Alright, if you're not going to talk,"
E_S1_Main24_25,"we'll have to use force to make you talk."
E_S1_Main25_1,"Argh! That hurts! Stop!"
E_S1_Main25_2,"Hnngg..."
E_S1_Main25_3,"Now, give up and spill!"
E_S1_Main25_4,"Those explosives are for tonight's fireworks show."
E_S1_Main25_5,"Why did you steal them?"
E_S1_Main25_6,"Sheesh, why, you ask?"
E_S1_Main25_7,"Because ordinary fireworks are boring. We wanted to improve them,"
E_S1_Main25_8,"making them go off multiple times instead of just once!"
E_S1_Main25_9,"We no need ordinary fireworks!"
E_S1_Main25_10,"We wanted the prize money from the water gun competition, but we didn't win."
E_S1_Main25_11,"One great step toward a new explosion!"
E_S1_Main25_12,"What?"
E_S1_Main25_13,"In other words, you're not satisfied with the usual fireworks show in Orvel, right?"
E_S1_Main25_14,"Yes! / Right!"
E_S1_Main25_15,"Heh heh heh, then I've got a great idea."
E_S1_Main25_16,"Your Highness, can I have these kids for a while?"
E_S1_Main25_17,"I'll take care of the fireworks event."
E_S1_Main25_18,"..."
E_S1_Main25_19,"If you're so sure, I'll leave these two under your custody, Annette."
E_S1_Main25_20,"I'll trust you with tonight's event, too."
E_S1_Main25_21,"Let's go, Chase."
E_S1_Main25_22,"Alright, then..."
E_S1_Main25_23,"It's time for a fun experiment!"
E_S1_Main25_24,"Annette, I don't know what you're trying to do,"
E_S1_Main25_25,"but it's about time the fireworks show began."
E_S1_Main25_26,"Princess, look."
E_S1_Main25_27,"There are thousands of balls in the sky."
E_S1_Main25_28,"Oooh!"
E_S1_Main25_29,"This is fun! Heh heh heh!"
E_S1_Main25_30,"Ready?"
E_S1_Main25_31,"The cannon's ready."
E_S1_Main25_32,"Leviathan Mark 2 is in place."
E_S1_Main25_33,"Filled with explosives, too!"
E_S1_Main25_34,"Just need to charge it with a bit more energy!"
E_S1_Main25_35,"Kara, feed it some energy."
E_S1_Main25_36,"Got it, Master."
E_S1_Main25_37,"Energy fully charged."
E_S1_Main25_38,"FIRE!!!!!"
E_S1_Main25_39,"Wow!"
E_S1_Main25_40,"This is the biggest, most spectacular fireworks show I've ever seen! Heh heh!"
E_S1_Main25_41,"Ho ho ho..."
E_S1_Main25_42,"This is the power of Miruru's cannon!"
E_S1_Main25_43,"..."
E_S1_Main25_44,"Art..."
E_S1_Main25_45,"There is art in explosion."
E_S1_Main25_46,"How beautiful!"
E_S1_Main25_47,"Hah hah hah. They deserve a prize, not punishment."
E_S1_Main25_48,"Not a day went by without some kind of trouble,"
E_S1_Main25_49,"but I'm glad this happened today."
E_S1_Main25_50,"Hah hah. I'm glad too, Princess."
E_S1_Main25_51,"By the way, those fireworks... They're not getting any weaker."
E_S1_Main25_52,"How long do they last?"
E_S1_Main25_53,"2 hours later"
E_S1_Main25_54,"They're still going strong."
E_S1_Main25_55,"Infinite fireworks."
E_S1_Main25_56,"Let's go, Chase."
E_S1_Main25_57,"It figures, today was not an exception."
E_S1_Main25_58,"Hah hah hah."
E_S1_Main26_1,"*Ahem* We had a hard time getting rid of those never-ending fireworks,"
E_S1_Main26_2,"but everything else went exceptionally well yesterday."
E_S1_Main26_3,"Heh heh. Sorry, sorry. I might have gone overboard with them."
E_S1_Main26_4,"Hah hah hah. But they were beautiful."
E_S1_Main26_5,"Everyone was happy, and that's what matters."
E_S1_Main26_6,"Now, today is the last day of the festival. To celebrate its last night,"
E_S1_Main26_7,"we'll hold the Festival of Music, a party around the last campfire of the festival."
E_S1_Main26_8,"It'll be a night of the arts, with dancing and singing."
E_S1_Main26_9,"Ack, dance..."
E_S1_Main26_10,"Mm? Annette, do you have a bad dancing experience?"
E_S1_Main26_11,"Ah hah hah. Kind of?"
E_S1_Main26_12,"I've never had a good dancing experience..."
E_S1_Main26_13,"The Master just doesn't know how to dance."
E_S1_Main26_14,"She just has no rhythm in her body."
E_S1_Main26_15,"Hush!"
E_S1_Main26_16,"Hah hah hah. Perhaps I can hire a dance instructor for you later."
E_S1_Main26_17,"But this night, you're not required to dance certain styles."
E_S1_Main26_18,"You can just dance however you like."
E_S1_Main26_19,"So, you don't need to worry at all."
E_S1_Main26_20,"The Master doesn't even know how to just move her bod... euppp! Eupp!"
E_S1_Main26_21,"Kara dances better than I do. I'll let her dance for me!"
E_S1_Main26_22,"Anyhoo!"
E_S1_Main26_23,"It's the last event of this festival, so you want us to take special care of it, right?"
E_S1_Main26_24,"How do we supervise events like this, anyway?"
E_S1_Main26_25,"Being the last event of the festival, it should go smoothly, so long as no one tries to stir up trouble."
E_S1_Main26_26,"Of course, that'll hardly be the case, given our record so far."
E_S1_Main26_27,"This has been hard on you, Princess."
E_S1_Main26_28,"I recommend you take break from work for a while after this festival."
E_S1_Main26_29,"Hah hah."
E_S1_Main26_30,"I'll think about it."
E_S1_Main26_31,"Then, shall we go?"
E_S1_Main27_1,"Hello. Welcome to the Festival of Music"
E_S1_Main27_2,"on the last night of the Orvel Summer Festival."
E_S1_Main27_3,"For this year's Summer Festival, Orvel Guild Alliance has prepared many things in collaboration with the Palace."
E_S1_Main27_4,"Thank you all for participating in the festival so far."
E_S1_Main27_5,"I hope you'll enjoy tonight,"
E_S1_Main27_6,"the last night of the festival, until the end."
E_S1_Main27_7,"Finally, it's begun."
E_S1_Main27_8,"*Sigh* I really hope nothing happens tonight."
E_S1_Main27_9,"So far, your hope has been futile."
E_S1_Main27_10,"But things worked out on their own, didn't they? Heh heh."
E_S1_Main27_11,"That's not what I want, anyway. I want to see Kara dance."
E_S1_Main27_12,"Master, when can I stop?"
E_S1_Main27_13,"People are looking at me."
E_S1_Main27_14,"Not now!"
E_S1_Main27_15,"I'm measuring your response to other people's attention to you."
E_S1_Main27_16,"For accurate results, you'll have to dance for at least 10 more minutes."
E_S1_Main27_17,"Understood, Master."
E_S1_Main27_18,"Can I at least change my dancing speed?"
E_S1_Main27_19,"You can speed up, if you want!"
E_S1_Main27_20,"By the way, what kind of dance is that?"
E_S1_Main27_21,"I've never seen it before."
E_S1_Main27_22,"Ah, neither have I,"
E_S1_Main27_23,"but I think it's from that past technomagic civilization."
E_S1_Main27_24,"I had her just follow what's left in her data."
E_S1_Main27_25,"I must say the people of old times danced in a peculiar way."
E_S1_Main27_26,"Chase, do you know any dance styles?"
E_S1_Main27_27,"I may have known how to dance in the past."
E_S1_Main27_28,"I don't remember now."
E_S1_Main27_29,"Hm, I shouldn't have asked."
E_S1_Main27_30,"I'm sorry, Chase."
E_S1_Main27_31,"Don't worry about it, Princess."
E_S1_Main27_32,"By the way, shouldn't we check the other areas?"
E_S1_Main27_33,"Mm, you're right."
E_S1_Main27_34,"Annette, I'll leave this side to you."
E_S1_Main27_35,"We'll watch the festival from the other side of the Plaza."
E_S1_Main27_36,"Okie dokie."
E_S1_Main28_1,"A lot of things happened, but we were able to go through with every event we planned."
E_S1_Main28_2,"Seriously, it was one surprise after another. It was exciting, though."
E_S1_Main28_3,"Your country is full of oddballs."
E_S1_Main28_4,"I wonder if where I used to live was like this, too."
E_S1_Main28_5,"People are the same wherever you go."
E_S1_Main28_6,"If you get your memories back, I'd love to see you dance and sing like the people of your country do."
E_S1_Main28_7,"Sure. I'd love that, too."
E_S1_Main28_8,"By the way, aren't you going to sing and dance, Princess?"
E_S1_Main28_9,"Hah hah. Want to see?"
E_S1_Main28_10,"I don't think you'll like it."
E_S1_Main28_11,"I'm not asking for my sake."
E_S1_Main28_12,"Princess, you need to relax sometimes, like everyone else."
E_S1_Main28_13,"You haven't taken any breaks throughout this entire event."
E_S1_Main28_14,"Hah hah. Neither did you."
E_S1_Main28_15,"..."
E_S1_Main29_1,"Hm... This is different from the Empire's festivals in many ways."
E_S1_Main29_2,"Don't you agree, Cassandra Golding? As the owner of the Gold Bar, you should know."
E_S1_Main29_3,"Ho ho. I'm surprised to meet a Royal Knight in a place like this."
E_S1_Main29_4,"You're a long way from home. Who's your charge today?"
E_S1_Main29_5,"Hah hah. I'm sure you already know."
E_S1_Main29_6,"You have eyes that captivate people and see through them."
E_S1_Main29_7,"You know what's happening in the seedier side of the Empire better than anyone else."
E_S1_Main29_8,"Oh, so you know."
E_S1_Main29_9,"So, what brings you to me, Knight of the Fluttering Blade?"
E_S1_Main29_10,"Nothing."
E_S1_Main29_11,"I just came here, following a familiar melody."
E_S1_Main29_12,"Ho ho ho. I'm the owner of a bar for a reason."
E_S1_Main29_13,"I'm next to none when it comes to singing and dancing."
E_S1_Main29_14,"Hah hah. So am I."
E_S1_Main29_15,"I'm good at singing and dancing in the Imperial style."
E_S1_Main29_16,"How about we see who's better?"
E_S1_Main29_17,"Ho ho. Sure."
E_S1_Main29_18,"I'm not just going to let you win. You'd better do your best, Sir Knight."
E_S1_Main29_19,"...."
E_S1_Main29_20,"I hear... something familiar..."
E_S1_Main29_21,"Hm?"
E_S1_Main29_22,"What's going on, Chase?"
E_S1_Main29_23,"..."
E_S1_Main29_24,"...?"
E_S1_Main30_1,"...."
E_S1_Main30_2,"Chase, wait! Where are you going... Hm?"
E_S1_Main30_3,"Oh, more people came to watch us."
E_S1_Main30_4,"Do you like listening to me singing so much?"
E_S1_Main30_5,"Mm? He's..."
E_S1_Main30_6,"Hm? Do you know him?"
E_S1_Main30_7,"Ho ho. Nothing."
E_S1_Main30_8,"I'm just flattered to have such a handsome man"
E_S1_Main30_9,"listen to me singing with such a rapt look on his face."
E_S1_Main30_10,"You're such a smooth talker, if nothing else."
E_S1_Main30_11,"This melody is... familiar."
E_S1_Main30_12,"But... I can't remember..."
E_S1_Main30_13,"Chase!"
E_S1_Main30_14,"Ah, Princess."
E_S1_Main30_15,"What happened?"
E_S1_Main30_16,"You just up and left all of a sudden."
E_S1_Main30_17,"Nothing."
E_S1_Main30_18,"I thought I was remembering something... I don't know yet."
E_S1_Main30_19,"...?"
E_S1_Main30_20,"Did you find some clue to your memories?"
E_S1_Main30_21,"I don't know..."
E_S1_Main30_22,"But that's not important."
E_S1_Main30_23,"My duty is to protect you, Princess."
E_S1_Main30_24,"I'm sorry I left you defenseless."
E_S1_Main30_25,"Alright, if you say so."
E_S1_Main30_26,"The festival is almost over. Let's go join Annette."
E_S1_Main30_27,"Got it."
E_S1_Main30_28,"..."
E_S1_Main30_29,"The Empire...?"
E_S1_Main30_30,"Hm, I'd better check after the festival..."
E_S1_Main30_31,"Your Highneeeess!"
E_S1_Main30_32,"What is it?"
E_S1_Main30_33,"Some Demons have shown up at the stalls! They're gorging on the food!"
E_S1_Main30_34,"Some goblin threw those never-ending fireworks into the campfire!"
E_S1_Main30_35,"...."
E_S1_Main30_36,"This isn't going to end, is it? Hah hah hah."
E_S1_Main30_37,"Let's go, Chase. With this festival, it's just one thing after another!"
E_S1_Main30_38,"Such is fate, I suppose."
E_H2_Main_0_1,"Urgh!"
E_H2_Main_0_2,"Kyaa!"
E_H2_Main_0_3,"Argh! What kind of place is this!?"
E_H2_Main_0_4,"Umm, this smell..."
E_H2_Main_0_5,"You, Crab Legs! Get off from me!"
E_H2_Main_0_6,"You're heavy!"
E_H2_Main_0_7,"Oh, you were there?"
E_H2_Main_0_8,"It's surprising that you're so bulky and yet so hard to notice."
E_H2_Main_0_9,"What are you talking about?"
E_H2_Main_0_10,"You knew I was down here!"
E_H2_Main_0_11,"Keh heh, you got me."
E_H2_Main_0_12,"Well. We shouldn't let ourselves get bothered by little things."
E_H2_Main_0_13,"What's important is that we are summoned by some creepy woman."
E_H2_Main_0_14,"Haha. Words hurt, you know!"
E_H2_Main_0_15,"I don't remember doing anything to offend you."
E_H2_Main_0_16,"Nonsense!"
E_H2_Main_0_17,"I said it because I can't get what you are thinking!"
E_H2_Main_0_18,"And then, there's your soul!"
E_H2_Main_0_19,"It's the curse in its primal form, and I can't even eat it!"
E_H2_Main_0_20,"You can't understand how frustrated I am."
E_H2_Main_0_21,"I'm standing in front of such a powerful Demon, and I can't even eat it!"
E_H2_Main_0_22,"Haha, I'm pretty disappointed."
E_H2_Main_0_23,"You don't have the power or the confidence to even endure this curse,"
E_H2_Main_0_24,"but you're still aiming to be the Dark Lord."
E_H2_Main_0_25,"Maybe that power let you crawl out from the bottom of the Pandemonium, but I guess that's as far as it goes."
E_H2_Main_0_26,"You're ridiculous, Little Demon of Gluttony. Oh, right! You call yourself a Great Demon, don't you? *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_0_27,"What the!? You..."
E_H2_Main_0_28,"I don't know who you are or what you're talking about."
E_H2_Main_0_29,"But everything that's coming out of your mouth is nonsense. Do you want to die?"
E_H2_Main_0_30,"Haha, dear, you're not much better than I am, Blue Demon's child."
E_H2_Main_0_31,"Sure, you've got the power of the great Demon, Lucikiel, and the limitless potential of a human."
E_H2_Main_0_32,"You really are quite a miraculous child."
E_H2_Main_0_33,"However... By denying your own existence, you can't even use your true strength."
E_H2_Main_0_34,"The blood in you is so special and blessed, it's pathetic you're not even using it."
E_H2_Main_0_35,"Wh-what!? Pathetic?"
E_H2_Main_0_36,"How can you say that? What do you even know about me?"
E_H2_Main_0_37,"Haha, Well. What do I know about you?"
E_H2_Main_0_38,"Maybe I know that you're close to a child from the Republic of Gray."
E_H2_Main_0_39,"Or maybe, I'm familiar with the story about Lucikiel?"
E_H2_Main_0_40,"I see."
E_H2_Main_0_41,"You're Shamilla, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_0_42,"You're the Demon that Epis told me about!"
E_H2_Main_0_43,"What in the world have you done to Theo?"
E_H2_Main_0_44,"Haha, I just made a contract with him."
E_H2_Main_0_45,"On the day his princess revives, his eyes will open."
E_H2_Main_0_46,"I put two curses on him, petrification and freeze, and turned him into a statue guarding the coffin of the princess."
E_H2_Main_0_47,"If he were an ordinary human, the passage of time would have already turned him to dust."
E_H2_Main_0_48,"I'm sure that would have been nice to watch, a child stubbornly fighting fate and crumbling away in vain..."
E_H2_Main_0_49,"But his determination touched the heart of the Divine Beast and gave birth to a great force of life."
E_H2_Main_0_50,"Ahhh, that unexpected energy of blazing human emotion and spirit..."
E_H2_Main_0_51,"That was much more fun to watch! Ahhh..."
E_H2_Main_0_52,"You disgust me..."
E_H2_Main_0_53,"Haha, again. What hurtful words."
E_H2_Main_0_54,"I am the one that has hidden him from Malduk and cured him from petrification."
E_H2_Main_0_55,"I've also kept his princess, Jane Grey, from becoming Malduk's plaything and brought her soul to awakening."
E_H2_Main_0_56,"...???"
E_H2_Main_0_57,"Haha, I can let you meet her if you like."
E_H2_Main_0_58,"She should be with that Succubus by now."
E_H2_Main_0_59,"Let's bring them here. What do you say?"
E_H2_Main_0_60,"What?"
E_H2_Main_0_61,"Kyaa!"
E_H2_Main_0_62,"Zzz... Umm?"
E_H2_Main_0_63,"Urgh, What the hell!?"
E_H2_Main_0_64,"I was having this nice dream... Huh!?"
E_H2_Main_0_65,"Shamilla?"
E_H2_Main_0_66,"It's been a long time, Epis."
E_H2_Main_0_67,"As always, you're enjoying your freedom, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_0_68,"...."
E_H2_Main_0_69,"Jane! Wake up, Jane!"
E_H2_Main_0_70,"We need to run now!"
E_H2_Main_0_71,"We've got to get away from this evil witch!"
E_H2_Main_0_72,"Epis? And... Jane!?"
E_H2_Main_0_73,"She should be the one Theo was looking for...!"
E_H2_Main_0_74,"Haha, witch? Well, that's not wrong, I suppose."
E_H2_Main_0_75,"Anyway, let me tell you the reason why I brought you all here."
E_H2_Main_0_76,"I need you to do me a favor."
E_H2_Main_0_77,"???"
E_H2_Main_0_78,"What are you talking about?"
E_H2_Main_0_79,"Zzzz..."
E_H2_Main_0_80,"Well, you'll get the full explanation later."
E_H2_Main_0_81,"But first, I should put you two to sleep for now."
E_H2_Main_0_82,"...!!!"
E_H2_Main_0_83,"Ugh...!"
E_H2_Main_0_84,"I can't..."
E_H2_Main_1_1,"Ummmmm..."
E_H2_Main_1_2,"Uh!?"
E_H2_Main_1_3,"Haha, it worked pretty well."
E_H2_Main_1_4,"I've put a curse on both of you to keep your Demon sides in check."
E_H2_Main_1_5,"That part of you will be asleep for a while."
E_H2_Main_1_6,"Don't you think that's a little too much?"
E_H2_Main_1_7,"I don't like demons too, but this one has been taking care of me after saving my life."
E_H2_Main_1_8,"She even lets me take control of my body from time to time."
E_H2_Main_1_9,"That's quite... different."
E_H2_Main_1_10,"The Demon blood in me..."
E_H2_Main_1_11,"Once it takes control, it won't let go, no matter what."
E_H2_Main_1_12,"Phew, it's been a long time since I had any control over this body. Thank you."
E_H2_Main_1_13,"Haha, that was the whole point of the curse."
E_H2_Main_1_14,"It's a temporary suppression. The demon in you isn't fully sealed away."
E_H2_Main_1_15,"If you help me, I'll release you from the curse."
E_H2_Main_1_16,"Of course, if you like, you can keep the curse and have control over it as well. *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_1_17,"...."
E_H2_Main_1_18,"Haha, I can tell you've got your doubts right now."
E_H2_Main_1_19,"Don't worry. I won't ask you to hurt or kill anyone."
E_H2_Main_1_20,"I'll also give you something in return for your help after everything's done."
E_H2_Main_1_21,"Perhaps I could provide you with a way to better control the Demon powers..."
E_H2_Main_1_22,"...!!!"
E_H2_Main_1_23,"...Okay."
E_H2_Main_1_24,"..."
E_H2_Main_1_25,"Are you leaving already, Epis? It's still a bit early, isn't it?"
E_H2_Main_1_26,"I want to ask you to do something as well."
E_H2_Main_1_27,"Psh, you really got me good, didn't you?"
E_H2_Main_1_28,"Well, I know I can't leave Jane here alone."
E_H2_Main_1_29,"...?"
E_H2_Main_1_30,"...Something about this magical energy is familiar."
E_H2_Main_1_31,"Oh, you remember me? How sweet!"
E_H2_Main_1_32,"*Giggle* What an adorable undead lady you are."
E_H2_Main_1_33,"So, what do you want?"
E_H2_Main_1_34,"Let's get this over with! I can't bear to be with you for too long. You make me feel sick."
E_H2_Main_1_35,"Oh, there's no reason for you to be like that."
E_H2_Main_1_36,"It's easy for you to say. You're not the one that's had to suffer."
E_H2_Main_1_37,"Haha, why, didn't you have fun?"
E_H2_Main_1_38,"But don't worry, Epis. This time won't be too difficult."
E_H2_Main_1_39,"Let me just say there's a need to do some ghost-hunting."
E_H2_Main_1_40,"How easy does that sound?"
E_H2_Main_1_41,"Your 'easy' always means a disaster for me."
E_H2_Main_1_42,"Haha, really? Hmmm, I can't help but wonder why."
E_H2_Main_1_43,"Urgh, your words are really messing with my head."
E_H2_Main_1_44,"*Giggle* Your hostility against me only makes me want to tease you more."
E_H2_Main_1_45,"Well, enough chatting for today."
E_H2_Main_1_46,"Now, take these clothes and put them on, please."
E_H2_Main_1_47,"This should help you attract evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_1_48,"...?"
E_H2_Main_1_49,"Wait! What in the world is this?"
E_H2_Main_2_1,"Anything else, I could understand, but this...!?"
E_H2_Main_2_2,"Why should I dress like an angel?"
E_H2_Main_2_3,"And why do these keep sticking around me?"
E_H2_Main_2_4,"Haha, evil spirits aren't actually scared of angels."
E_H2_Main_2_5,"Purification is a means of salvation to souls in agony."
E_H2_Main_2_6,"They'll lunge at you unless they have something better to do."
E_H2_Main_2_7,"I wouldn't worry about the others, but Epis, you shouldn't fight back against them."
E_H2_Main_2_8,"They'll figure out that you're not one of the angels."
E_H2_Main_2_9,"Urgh, what kind of torture is this, getting beaten around by these weak spirits?"
E_H2_Main_2_10,"And you! You're dressed like an angel, too!"
E_H2_Main_2_11,"Why aren't these things lunging at you at all?"
E_H2_Main_2_12,"Oh, this isn't what angels wear. It looks awfully similar, though, huh?"
E_H2_Main_2_13,"It's the look of that fairy of love from those old folktales... I think he was called Cupid?"
E_H2_Main_2_14,"It suits me if you think about it. I'm playing a matchmaker between Theo and Jane, a couple that's spent such a long time away from each other."
E_H2_Main_2_15,"..."
E_H2_Main_2_16,"Psh, I was a fool to ask you that."
E_H2_Main_2_17,"I can see why Jane is a mummy since she's... well, undead."
E_H2_Main_2_18,"But why are these two animals?"
E_H2_Main_2_19,"*Giggle* Don't you agree that they look adorable in those animal costumes?"
E_H2_Main_2_20,"I chose those after taking everything, from their characters and battle styles, into consideration."
E_H2_Main_2_21,"What about me? Did you bring this just to make me look funny?"
E_H2_Main_2_22,"Oh no, Epis. You are just very angel-like."
E_H2_Main_2_23,"You're call a Demon angel-like? That's practically an insult."
E_H2_Main_2_24,"By the way... Those two seem to be having a hard time fighting with their Demon sides suppressed."
E_H2_Main_2_25,"My curse shouldn't keep them from using their powers... I guess they need more time to get used to it."
E_H2_Main_2_26,"I can see that the girl holding the Demon of Gluttony inside is trying to fight,"
E_H2_Main_2_27,"but Lucikiel's child is refusing to accept the power in his blood out of fear."
E_H2_Main_2_28,"Argh, what is this?"
E_H2_Main_2_29,"I don't feel as strong as I should be."
E_H2_Main_2_30,"I was much better than this when I was in control..."
E_H2_Main_2_31,"Grrr, kugh..."
E_H2_Main_2_32,"I can't seem to use my powers very well."
E_H2_Main_2_33,"I'm sorry for being a burden for you two."
E_H2_Main_2_34,"...."
E_H2_Main_2_35,"Anyway, it's quite amazing."
E_H2_Main_2_36,"How can she fight so well with such a slender build?"
E_H2_Main_2_37,"Her name was...Jane? Jane..."
E_H2_Main_2_38,"The name sounds very familiar... I must have heard it before..."
E_H2_Main_2_39,"I guess I heard it when the other side of me was in control. I can't seem to remember."
E_H2_Main_2_40,"She looks about the same age as me. How did she end up becoming an undead?"
E_H2_Main_2_41,"Ah, come to think of it, the same thing almost happened to me as well."
E_H2_Main_2_42,"Oh, right. It's our first time meeting each other while I'm me."
E_H2_Main_2_43,"I believe you know the other side of me pretty well..."
E_H2_Main_2_44,"Right..."
E_H2_Main_2_45,"The other side of me always pulls pranks and makes fun of you, doesn't she?"
E_H2_Main_2_46,"I'm sorry..."
E_H2_Main_2_47,"Ahhahaha. No worries. She's been doing that to the other side of me, so no hard feelings."
E_H2_Main_2_48,"Well, personally, Viska... Umm... Actually, I don't know what to call you. Hahaha."
E_H2_Main_2_49,"My name..."
E_H2_Main_2_50,"I don't actually remember it."
E_H2_Main_2_51,"But, yes. It'll be a little bit awkward without one."
E_H2_Main_2_52,"Then... Uh, just call me Vi."
E_H2_Main_2_53,"Call me Vi, please."
E_H2_Main_2_54,"That should do it."
E_H2_Main_2_55,"Alright, Vi."
E_H2_Main_2_56,"Hahaha..."
E_H2_Main_2_57,"Hahaha..."
E_H2_Main_2_58,"..."
E_H2_Main_2_59,"Kyaaaa!"
E_H2_Main_2_60,"Stop it with the chitchat! Can I get a little help here?"
E_H2_Main_2_61,"I can't fight right now!"
E_H2_Main_3_1,"Grrr, Kugh..."
E_H2_Main_3_2,"This... This isn't right!"
E_H2_Main_3_3,"Haha, are you tired already?"
E_H2_Main_3_4,"We barely got started."
E_H2_Main_3_5,"Argh!"
E_H2_Main_3_6,"Uh, what's that?"
E_H2_Main_3_7,"Umm, they're exuding dark energy that's much stronger than before."
E_H2_Main_3_8,"Wait. Are they actually in human bodies?"
E_H2_Main_3_9,"Haha, those are the ones I was looking for."
E_H2_Main_3_10,"Now, here's what we'll have to do today."
E_H2_Main_3_11,"Simply put, it's an exorcism,"
E_H2_Main_3_12,"expelling higher evil spirits from those human bodies."
E_H2_Main_3_13,"...?"
E_H2_Main_3_14,"Huh? It's something really different from what I've thought it would be. This kind of work doesn't suit you, either."
E_H2_Main_3_15,"Those higher evil spirits are actually astral composites created by aggregations of lost souls."
E_H2_Main_3_16,"They are the curse itself formed, from all things that are corrupt and evil in every corner of the world."
E_H2_Main_3_17,"With enough time and power gathered in them..."
E_H2_Main_3_18,"They will be a great threat to the material world, especially to the living."
E_H2_Main_3_19,"...Wait."
E_H2_Main_3_20,"The incident that created those things..."
E_H2_Main_3_21,"Yes, they are the evil spirits of the highest rank, formed 100 years ago during the Demon War."
E_H2_Main_3_22,"They all have different characteristics, which makes them unpredictable and interesting."
E_H2_Main_3_23,"Umm, they could pose a serious threat to those who don't know anything about them."
E_H2_Main_3_24,"That's right."
E_H2_Main_3_25,"Those who come out to enjoy Halloween might be caught unaware and get possessed by them."
E_H2_Main_3_26,"Well, honestly, it's not something that I need to deal with myself,"
E_H2_Main_3_27,"but I felt that something very fun would happen today, haha."
E_H2_Main_3_28,"What, wait!"
E_H2_Main_3_29,"You could actually deal with this one your own, couldn't you?"
E_H2_Main_3_30,"Why in the world did you bring all of us...?"
E_H2_Main_3_31,"I just told you. I felt that something fun would happen."
E_H2_Main_3_32,"I shouldn't keep all the fun to myself. *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_3_33,"Well, I enjoy fun things as much as anyone else,"
E_H2_Main_3_34,"but I feel there's huge difference in our definition of 'fun.'"
E_H2_Main_3_35,"Don't think too deeply on it. Just consider this a nice, memorable event."
E_H2_Main_3_36,"And a good memory always takes place in a peculiar setting. Haha."
E_H2_Main_3_37,"I never understand what you're saying, and I pretty much hate you. Maria is the only reason I'm putting up with you."
E_H2_Main_3_38,"That 100 year-old friendship... *Sigh*"
E_H2_Main_3_39,"I don't understand why Maria likes you when all you have is vague information that drags people into weird stuff."
E_H2_Main_3_40,"I mean, really. Can you ever tell us something directly?"
E_H2_Main_3_41,"Like, the reason why Theo and Jane are so important in the plan you're forming with Maria!"
E_H2_Main_3_42,"I'm fine with taking care of Jane because it's fun, but I want to be free sometimes!"
E_H2_Main_3_43,"You're already as free as a bird, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_3_44,"I've heard that you disappear sometimes while Jane's left alone."
E_H2_Main_3_45,"*Cough, cough*"
E_H2_Main_3_46,"Well, I'll let it slide. But please, be patient for a little while."
E_H2_Main_3_47,"It won't be long until the curtain closes the first act, haha."
E_H2_Main_3_48,"It's been 100 years. A little while is not a problem for me."
E_H2_Main_3_49,"*Sigh*"
E_H2_Main_4_1,"Haha, are you getting better at using your powers?"
E_H2_Main_4_2,"Well, I'm not sure yet."
E_H2_Main_4_3,"Compared to the times when I've taken control in ordinary situations..."
E_H2_Main_4_4,"My body feels heavier and harder to control."
E_H2_Main_4_5,"This really does feel weird."
E_H2_Main_4_6,"I haven't tried to use my powers by myself before."
E_H2_Main_4_7,"I've never even thought about how I could awaken the power in my arms."
E_H2_Main_4_8,"I was afraid of my Demon blood... and I've worked hard to seal it..."
E_H2_Main_4_9,"Every time I regain consciousness, blood is all over my hands..."
E_H2_Main_4_10,"Haha, don't you worry."
E_H2_Main_4_11,"You might experience a pretty big difference when all of this is over."
E_H2_Main_4_12,"Now, we should send those evil spirits we've gathered to where they belong."
E_H2_Main_4_13,"Jane, you are the only one who can actually use your power."
E_H2_Main_4_14,"I should ask you to deal with the evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_4_15,"Krrrr."
E_H2_Main_4_16,"Try all you want, Demons!"
E_H2_Main_4_17,"We won't be killed by you."
E_H2_Main_4_18,"We can only be scattered."
E_H2_Main_4_19,"There were times we thought we could possess human bodies and live among them."
E_H2_Main_4_20,"It seems that was nothing but a dream."
E_H2_Main_4_21,"We do not care. We don't feel pain, dismay, frustration, or despair."
E_H2_Main_4_22,"We have given up everything, cursing the living."
E_H2_Main_4_23,"Are all evil spirits like that?"
E_H2_Main_4_24,"Those were some of the most cheesy cliches I've heard in my life."
E_H2_Main_4_25,"Hahahaha."
E_H2_Main_4_26,"It's embarrassing, but my demon self says stuff like that, too..."
E_H2_Main_4_27,"....."
E_H2_Main_4_28,"I don't curse..."
E_H2_Main_4_29,"Pain... dismay... sorrow... despair..."
E_H2_Main_4_30,"I don't know such things..."
E_H2_Main_4_31,"I just... want to know... who I am."
E_H2_Main_4_32,"Haha, it's meaningless to talk to evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_4_33,"They are the residue of souls left rotting in the world."
E_H2_Main_4_34,"Finish them now, please. We should look for some other evil spirits and get rid of them, too."
E_H2_Main_4_35,"..."
E_H2_Main_4_36,"....?"
E_H2_Main_4_37,"Jane, Jane? Let's go if you're done!"
E_H2_Main_4_38,"...Okay."
E_H2_Main_4_39,"Zzz...Zzz..."
E_H2_Main_4_40,"Nyx, you idiot. You better warp me right next time... *Snore*"
E_H2_Main_4_41,"...Hmm, you were possessed this year as well?"
E_H2_Main_4_42,"I've been helping Rephy every year since Oddy asked, but... Haha."
E_H2_Main_4_43,"Haha, those evil spirits really have a thing for you. Don't you think so, Nyx?"
E_H2_Main_4_44,"It was the spirits of vampires that died during the ruination of Galluah Plains 100 years ago, wasn't it?"
E_H2_Main_4_45,"Pfft, all thanks to you."
E_H2_Main_4_46,"Your curse has made this place quite a gathering ground for the spirits."
E_H2_Main_4_47,"Hahaha, this is more like a prank than a curse."
E_H2_Main_4_48,"And you could have lifted the curse if you wanted to, couldn't you?"
E_H2_Main_4_49,"Oh? Do you want me to cast something more powerful and make this more fun?"
E_H2_Main_4_50,"Hahaha, I politely decline."
E_H2_Main_4_51,"It's hardly a pleasant experience."
E_H2_Main_4_52,"Although I have to admit it was useful in getting rid of those evil spirits,"
E_H2_Main_4_53,"there's too many of them after us."
E_H2_Main_4_54,"*Giggle* Well, I have to say I'm grateful to you, Sage of the Sword."
E_H2_Main_4_55,"A massive number of evil spirits must have gathered here to possess someone with an unyielding soul like yourself."
E_H2_Main_4_56,"And the refined dark energy gained from exorcising them..."
E_H2_Main_4_57,"That allowed things to come along more quickly than what I had planned."
E_H2_Main_4_58,"I'm glad it helped, but I'm already exhausted."
E_H2_Main_4_59,"I guess I'll have to call it a day."
E_H2_Main_4_60,"Heh heh, I've seen you work. I can take over your role this year."
E_H2_Main_4_61,"The job is getting rid of all the evil spirits so that they won't do any harm to the living, right?"
E_H2_Main_4_62,"I'll handle this in my way and do as I please. After all, I need to find some benefit to doing all this."
E_H2_Main_4_63,"For what it's worth, you've been doing everything on your own way anyway."
E_H2_Main_4_64,"Hahaha. Well, as long as your way doesn't interfere with mine."
E_H2_Main_4_65,"I'll leave this year's Halloween to you."
E_H2_Main_4_66,"It'd be better that you take care of it rather than an outsider like myself."
E_H2_Main_4_67,"Leave it to me. *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_4_68,"Phew, she's a real handful."
E_H2_Main_4_69,"Hey, friend. Don't you think you should wake up now?"
E_H2_Main_4_70,"Zzz... Rephy, you! Listen to me... You do nothing but sleep."
E_H2_Main_4_71,"Haiz... Zzz, Zzz..."
E_H2_Main_4_72,"Hahaha, I wish I could be so laid-back."
E_H2_Main_4_73,"I doubt he'll remember being possessed at all."
E_H2_Main_5_1,"Oh, I was wondering why all we've seen are animals."
E_H2_Main_5_2,"It seems that the evil spirits of animals are attracted to their own kind, just like how darkness diseases work."
E_H2_Main_5_3,"Well, I never knew animals could become evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_5_4,"Well, the Dark Legion killed off all the living creatures they saw during the Demon War, so..."
E_H2_Main_5_5,"There's no doubt those animals bear a grudge."
E_H2_Main_5_6,"But don't they look strange?"
E_H2_Main_5_7,"They seem to be fighting among each other."
E_H2_Main_5_8,"Yes, so it seems. What's happening?"
E_H2_Main_5_9,"Come on, talk to me!"
E_H2_Main_5_10,"How long are you going to act sullen like that?"
E_H2_Main_5_11,"Huh!? I'm fine!"
E_H2_Main_5_12,"That's not the tone of someone who's fine."
E_H2_Main_5_13,"I told you, I'm fine!"
E_H2_Main_5_14,"It's just... we just wanted to possess something bigger, stronger, and scarier!"
E_H2_Main_5_15,"Look at us! We're a joke!"
E_H2_Main_5_16,"The other evil spirits will make fun of us!"
E_H2_Main_5_17,"Are we not cute?"
E_H2_Main_5_18,"There's nothing wrong with that!"
E_H2_Main_5_19,"Being cute is absolutely not the point!"
E_H2_Main_5_20,"Some of them were vampires,"
E_H2_Main_5_21,"and others were like cool dark knights!"
E_H2_Main_5_22,"And we're cats! Cats!"
E_H2_Main_5_23,"Cats are adorable,"
E_H2_Main_5_24,"but no one gets intimidated by a bunch of cats!"
E_H2_Main_5_25,"Hey, I know you like it."
E_H2_Main_5_26,"Cats are ferocious! Someone will find us threatening!"
E_H2_Main_5_27,"Urgh!!!!"
E_H2_Main_5_28,"Hmmm?"
E_H2_Main_5_29,"Are they really evil spirits?"
E_H2_Main_5_30,"I thought they were masses of corrupted energy."
E_H2_Main_5_31,"They're so cute!"
E_H2_Main_5_32,"Hahaha, like I said, they can be unpredictable."
E_H2_Main_5_33,"Animal souls are purer than human ones, even after they've become evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_5_34,"They didn't lose their minds to darkness, so they've retained their pure aspects."
E_H2_Main_5_35,"Adorable..."
E_H2_Main_5_36,"Should we get them and make them our pets?"
E_H2_Main_5_37,"Hahaha, that's very unlikely."
E_H2_Main_5_38,"What are we going to say to the ones that got possessed?"
E_H2_Main_5_39,"Cute..."
E_H2_Main_5_40,"...?"
E_H2_Main_5_41,"Jane? She's not used to showing her emotions..."
E_H2_Main_5_42,"Haha, it's a good sign."
E_H2_Main_5_43,"Just watch for now."
E_H2_Main_6_1,"Urgh, Darn it!"
E_H2_Main_6_2,"Uuurgh..."
E_H2_Main_6_3,"It's because of you! We should have taken stronger bodies, not cute ones!"
E_H2_Main_6_4,"Hey, easy."
E_H2_Main_6_5,"We're just a bunch of wandering souls."
E_H2_Main_6_6,"Maybe it's time for us to leave for where we should go."
E_H2_Main_6_7,"We look adorable and we're having fun! Isn't that all that matters?"
E_H2_Main_6_8,"I have to say you are the least evil spirits I've ever seen."
E_H2_Main_6_9,"Well, looking cute isn't that bad, actually..."
E_H2_Main_6_10,"No, wait. You're putting the wrong ideas in my head!"
E_H2_Main_6_11,"Uh oh, you got me."
E_H2_Main_6_12,"I think we keep bumping into some really weird evil spirits today."
E_H2_Main_6_13,"There were cheesy ones before, and"
E_H2_Main_6_14,"now these cuties..."
E_H2_Main_6_15,"Hahaha, I've never seen ones like them, either. It's pretty interesting."
E_H2_Main_6_16,"But work is work."
E_H2_Main_6_17,"They shouldn't have too much strength left in them. Let's finish up here."
E_H2_Main_6_18,"Ezekiel, please start."
E_H2_Main_6_19,"Eh? me?"
E_H2_Main_6_20,"You haven't been fighting as well as you could, right?"
E_H2_Main_6_21,"Shouldn't you be getting used to your powers so that you can resist your demon self?"
E_H2_Main_6_22,"..."
E_H2_Main_6_23,"Okay, I'll try."
E_H2_Main_6_24,"...Kuh!"
E_H2_Main_6_25,"Kugh, kugh. I, I did it!"
E_H2_Main_6_26,"Urgh!?"
E_H2_Main_6_27,"Kwaaaaaaah!!!"
E_H2_Main_6_28,"I won't let a single body part fall to these filthy evil spirits!"
E_H2_Main_6_29,"This is, this is my body! Mine!"
E_H2_Main_6_30,"I won't let anyone take it from me!"
E_H2_Main_6_31,"Kuh!"
E_H2_Main_6_32,"Are you okay!?"
E_H2_Main_6_33,"You look pale..."
E_H2_Main_6_34,"It's nothing. Hahaha...."
E_H2_Main_6_35,"I'm just tired from doing something new..."
E_H2_Main_6_36,"Yeah? As long as it's nothing serious..."
E_H2_Main_6_37,"*Sigh*"
E_H2_Main_6_38,"That was a strong reaction... What should I do later?"
E_H2_Main_6_39,"Urgh... My head hurts..."
E_H2_Main_6_40,"I was looking for a box of Halloween candy for my sister..."
E_H2_Main_6_41,"The demons came out of nowhere..."
E_H2_Main_6_42,"Urgh.. Where am I?"
E_H2_Main_6_43,"I was working on the Technomagical pumpkin decoration in the Royal Lab..."
E_H2_Main_6_44,"*Giggle* My apologies to both of you."
E_H2_Main_6_45,"I'm sorry to bother you."
E_H2_Main_6_46,"A Demon! You...!"
E_H2_Main_6_47,"Haha, no need for hostility. I won't harm you."
E_H2_Main_6_48,"Well, it's true when people say dragons are powerful beings."
E_H2_Main_6_49,"You can still remember things after you get possessed by evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_6_50,"Psh, we're powerful!"
E_H2_Main_6_51,"You'll pay dearly if you look down on me because I'm still young!"
E_H2_Main_6_52,"Huh? What happened?"
E_H2_Main_6_53,"I can't barely remember anything. Why am I wearing these clothes?"
E_H2_Main_6_54,"Oh, they're actually very cute! I should tell Kara to wear them later."
E_H2_Main_6_55,"Haha, it's nothing. I just let some wandering souls possess your bodies."
E_H2_Main_6_56,"You won't suffer any serious side effects."
E_H2_Main_6_57,"You mean... g-ghosts!?"
E_H2_Main_6_58,"I'm just getting help from those who have strong souls like the two of you."
E_H2_Main_6_59,"I've gathered enough refined dark energy. My business here is over."
E_H2_Main_6_60,"Thank you for your cooperation. Then, happy Halloween! *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_6_61,"...Grrr..."
E_H2_Main_6_62,"Hey! W-wake up!"
E_H2_Main_6_63,"Oh, no... I still need to find a present for my sister..."
E_H2_Main_6_64,"But then, I can't leave her here unconscious...!"
E_H2_Main_6_65,"I'll take you to the nearest inn!"
E_H2_Main_7_1,"Eww, they're so gross."
E_H2_Main_7_2,"I'm okay with spiders, but"
E_H2_Main_7_3,"those slimy things... Yuk!"
E_H2_Main_7_4,"Huh? Pudding? *Drool*"
E_H2_Main_7_5,"Uh? What is it, Ezekiel?"
E_H2_Main_7_6,"N-nothing!"
E_H2_Main_7_7,"They remind me of something..."
E_H2_Main_7_8,"...?"
E_H2_Main_7_9,"I was curious what kind of evil spirits would appear this time."
E_H2_Main_7_10,"Are they it? Kids' souls in monsters?"
E_H2_Main_7_11,"Hmm, not exactly."
E_H2_Main_7_12,"These monsters have nothing to do with evil spirits. Rather... They look like they're captivated."
E_H2_Main_7_13,"Captivated? By what?"
E_H2_Main_7_14,"Hmmm, well. Could it be your charm, Epis?"
E_H2_Main_7_15,"Kyaa! You're creeping me out!"
E_H2_Main_7_16,"Just kidding. Hahaha."
E_H2_Main_7_17,"Huh? Am I hearing things? Is that music?"
E_H2_Main_7_18,"...?"
E_H2_Main_7_19,"Have you heard it before, Jane?"
E_H2_Main_7_20,"...No."
E_H2_Main_7_21,"But, it's... beautiful."
E_H2_Main_7_22,"...Beautiful...?"
E_H2_Main_7_23,"Hmm..."
E_H2_Main_7_24,"It actually sounds pretty great!"
E_H2_Main_7_25,"Let's go take a look!"
E_H2_Main_7_26,"Heh heh heh. In our past lives, we were eaten by slimes, the minions of Demons,"
E_H2_Main_7_27,"but now that we've grown stronger, we'll capture them and make them our slaves!"
E_H2_Main_7_28,"This Halloween, we'll be slime masters!"
E_H2_Main_7_29,"Here, I've brought a lot of them again, so hurry and sing it!"
E_H2_Main_7_30,"A Blue Slime, Red Slime, Green Slime, I've got them all!"
E_H2_Main_7_31,"Oh and, I've burnt one of them while trying to catch them. You might want to heal it."
E_H2_Main_7_32,"Lala, La, La, Lalalalaa!"
E_H2_Main_7_33,"Hey, you're burning it even worse!"
E_H2_Main_7_34,"Not that song, the other one!"
E_H2_Main_7_35,"La, lalala!"
E_H2_Main_7_36,"Hey! You're not listening!"
E_H2_Main_7_37,"What in the world is this?..."
E_H2_Main_7_38,"Puddings.. in different colors!"
E_H2_Main_7_39,"You just love pudding when you're a human or a demon."
E_H2_Main_7_40,"It's surprising that you see them as pudding in the first place..."
E_H2_Main_7_41,"Ehhh? What?"
E_H2_Main_7_42,"I think they look just like pudding..."
E_H2_Main_7_43,"...Beautiful melody..."
E_H2_Main_7_44,"I can recall... The waltz I used to listen to..."
E_H2_Main_7_45,"I used to dance to it... Those memories..."
E_H2_Main_7_46,"..."
E_H2_Main_8_1,"Eww, gooey and sticky... Yuck!"
E_H2_Main_8_2,"..."
E_H2_Main_8_3,"...What are you doing?"
E_H2_Main_8_4,"Oh, oops! in spite of myself..."
E_H2_Main_8_5,"Boohoo! Our slime minions!"
E_H2_Main_8_6,"Heal, quickly!"
E_H2_Main_8_7,"Lulu, lulu!"
E_H2_Main_8_8,"..."
E_H2_Main_8_9,"Darn it! I should burn you all first!!"
E_H2_Main_8_10,"Well, maybe it's just me, but..."
E_H2_Main_8_11,"Except for the vampire evil spirits we first met, none of the other evil spirits made much sense."
E_H2_Main_8_12,"The cats and the witches..."
E_H2_Main_8_13,"They were like... They felt nothing like evil spirits."
E_H2_Main_8_14,"Haha, all evil spirits are different."
E_H2_Main_8_15,"Regardless of race, humans, Demons, or Angels, some of them get along and others simply don't."
E_H2_Main_8_16,"Like you and me, right?"
E_H2_Main_8_17,"Thank you, I understand it now very clearly."
E_H2_Main_8_18,"Why, it's great to hear that you think we get along."
E_H2_Main_8_19,"I have to say I'm quite happy and shy at the same time, Epis."
E_H2_Main_8_20,"Oh my..."
E_H2_Main_8_21,"Forget it. Let's just stop talking."
E_H2_Main_8_22,"Well, enough joking around. This time..."
E_H2_Main_8_23,"Viska, no, I should call you Vi."
E_H2_Main_8_24,"Please, it's your turn."
E_H2_Main_8_25,"Umm... Then I'll need to control my powers so I don't hurt the hosts..."
E_H2_Main_8_26,"...Hyaa!"
E_H2_Main_8_27,"Kyaaa! What the!?"
E_H2_Main_8_28,"I was chasing after a bunch of slimes... Huh?"
E_H2_Main_8_29,"Is this a dream? That's a lot of slimes..."
E_H2_Main_8_30,"Wait! They're all dead!"
E_H2_Main_8_31,"Nooooooo!"
E_H2_Main_8_32,"You brought them all. Clean them up yourself."
E_H2_Main_8_33,"It's a complete mess. All these slime bodies."
E_H2_Main_8_34,"Perhaps I could catch a slime and keep it as a pet...?"
E_H2_Main_8_35,"...!!"
E_H2_Main_8_36,"Oh! You know slimes are great!"
E_H2_Main_8_37,"I've explained it over and over again, but Roi just doesn't get it!"
E_H2_Main_8_38,"...Um? I'm just..."
E_H2_Main_8_39,"Hey, have a seat there."
E_H2_Main_8_40,"Let's talk about why slimes are so interesting!"
E_H2_Main_8_41,"...?????"
E_H2_Main_8_42,"Umm, he's in for it now..."
E_H2_Main_8_43,"I was singing some kind of unfinished song while I was sleeping?"
E_H2_Main_8_44,"I don't remember at all...."
E_H2_Main_8_45,"Hmm..."
E_H2_Main_8_46,"A very... beautiful melody...."
E_H2_Main_8_47,"I want... to hear it again..."
E_H2_Main_8_48,"...!"
E_H2_Main_8_49,"Heh heh, thank you!"
E_H2_Main_8_50,"I'll sing it to your when I finish making the song."
E_H2_Main_8_51,"Let's get moving if everything is done!"
E_H2_Main_8_52,"Hurry! I'm sick and tired of looking like an Angel."
E_H2_Main_8_53,"Oh, I'm hurt by what you said. Don't you like what I prepared for you?"
E_H2_Main_8_54,"You brought Angel clothes for a Demon!"
E_H2_Main_8_55,"..."
E_H2_Main_8_56,"But that child named Cleo..."
E_H2_Main_8_57,"Considering the characteristics of her mana and the fact that she remembers things..."
E_H2_Main_8_58,"Like they say, like mother, like daughter."
E_H2_Main_8_59,"We should keep an eye on her."
E_H2_Main_8_60,"To prevent any future incidents... *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_9_1,"So the Fallen Angels turned their backs on the Angels and came to earth."
E_H2_Main_9_2,"Along with Dark Lord Angmund, they..."
E_H2_Main_9_3,"Umm, this part will be on the exam, so study it, rookies."
E_H2_Main_9_4,"Those who fail to provide the correct answer will suffer heavenly wrath."
E_H2_Main_9_5,"Gerrrrrr…\n(How are we supposed to memorize all that...?)"
E_H2_Main_9_6,"Gaaaarrrr... (We don't have brains...)"
E_H2_Main_9_7,"Oh, is that so?"
E_H2_Main_9_8,"Then, shove off!"
E_H2_Main_9_9,"If you feel you can't do something, find a way to make it possible."
E_H2_Main_9_10,"I don't need any soldiers who can't think on their own."
E_H2_Main_9_11,"Guiiiiiii... (Kugh!!)"
E_H2_Main_9_12,"What in the world.. are they doing?"
E_H2_Main_9_13,"...I'm not sure..."
E_H2_Main_9_14,"This doesn't feel right..."
E_H2_Main_9_15,"Is my brain okay...?"
E_H2_Main_9_16,"Hahaha, don't worry, Jane."
E_H2_Main_9_17,"The undead don't rely on organs to function,"
E_H2_Main_9_18,"but on mana and the power of desire."
E_H2_Main_9_19,"The reason why you became what you are is that you had such a strong will. It's because of the desire left in you."
E_H2_Main_9_20,"And I saw it all, and that's how I became interested in you."
E_H2_Main_9_21,"*Giggle* For me, it's easy with my curse to twist Malduk's spells."
E_H2_Main_9_22,"..."
E_H2_Main_9_23,"Tell me honestly, Shamilla."
E_H2_Main_9_24,"Yes?"
E_H2_Main_9_25,"Those evil spirits, you're the one that made them all, aren't you?"
E_H2_Main_9_26,"The bodies of hosts might affect them to some extent, but they're too weird to be ordinary evil spirits!"
E_H2_Main_9_27,"It's your hobby, right? To twist the laws of nature, cause chaos, and watch it."
E_H2_Main_9_28,"I'm pretty sure these evil spirits are twisted and artificial."
E_H2_Main_9_29,"Hahaha, I won't deny it."
E_H2_Main_9_30,"I carefully selected the ones that have extraordinarily strong and pure souls,"
E_H2_Main_9_31,"and made them vulnerable to possession."
E_H2_Main_9_32,"Evil spirits that cling to such souls have their malice significantly weakened."
E_H2_Main_9_33,"However, like always, there's a reason why I did what I did."
E_H2_Main_9_34,"I saw that you were gathering refined dark energy!"
E_H2_Main_9_35,"The other three might be clueless, but I'm different."
E_H2_Main_9_36,"You couldn't have done all this just to pick on me."
E_H2_Main_9_37,"...Is it for 'him?'"
E_H2_Main_9_38,"Or is it for Maria?"
E_H2_Main_9_39,"Hahahaha... Well?"
E_H2_Main_9_40,"I'm afraid I can't tell you right now."
E_H2_Main_9_41,"What I can tell you is that I will need the power that Morrah was gathering, too."
E_H2_Main_9_42,"Hmm..."
E_H2_Main_9_43,"Well, I don't know much about your plan, so I can't say much more."
E_H2_Main_9_44,"Just don't do anything that would make Maria frown."
E_H2_Main_9_45,"She's just... a poor kid."
E_H2_Main_9_46,"Haha, well. I'll take that into consideration."
E_H2_Main_10_1,"Kyaah!"
E_H2_Main_10_2,"I'm sorry... Fallen angel."
E_H2_Main_10_3,"Kugh, You!"
E_H2_Main_10_4,"Dark Lord will not let you...!"
E_H2_Main_10_5,"I don't... need..."
E_H2_Main_10_6,"Bad spirit... bullying the undead..."
E_H2_Main_10_7,"Get off..."
E_H2_Main_10_8,"Huh, Jane can be pretty scary."
E_H2_Main_10_9,"She must have felt sorry for those undead creatures."
E_H2_Main_10_10,"By the way, that line they're saying about the Dark Lord coming for us..."
E_H2_Main_10_11,"They've been saying that for the last 100 years."
E_H2_Main_10_12,"Hahaha, I've never heard that."
E_H2_Main_10_13,"Well, honestly, I haven't done anything that would make them want to say that to me."
E_H2_Main_10_14,"They should be more afraid of you than the Dark Lord."
E_H2_Main_10_15,"The Dark Lord's purpose is plain and simple, but you..."
E_H2_Main_10_16,"Now, now. That's enough talking."
E_H2_Main_10_17,"Vi, Ezekiel. I guess you've gotten used to your powers, yes?"
E_H2_Main_10_18,"Um... I think so."
E_H2_Main_10_19,"My body doesn't feel as stiff as it used to."
E_H2_Main_10_20,"Same here. I couldn't control the demon blood at all at first."
E_H2_Main_10_21,"Is it because of your curse?"
E_H2_Main_10_22,"*Giggle* Partly, yes."
E_H2_Main_10_23,"The key here is getting accustomed to living with dark energy."
E_H2_Main_10_24,"All you needed was a little bit of practice."
E_H2_Main_10_25,"It's just..."
E_H2_Main_10_26,"Both of you were too suppressed by your demon selves."
E_H2_Main_10_27,"So you didn't have enough time nor the opportunity to get used to your powers."
E_H2_Main_10_28,"Hahaha, so this was training?"
E_H2_Main_10_29,"Well, yes."
E_H2_Main_10_30,"...I'm still a bit unsure... but yes, I think so, too."
E_H2_Main_10_31,"*Giggle* Glad to hear that."
E_H2_Main_10_32,"Now, we don't have a lot of evil spirits left around us."
E_H2_Main_10_33,"Let's go take care of them."
E_H2_Main_10_34,"I guess it's time."
E_H2_Main_10_35,"Jane is slowly recovering her emotions,"
E_H2_Main_10_36,"and two half demons have started to tap more into their power."
E_H2_Main_10_37,"The curses on them could be lifted fairly soon."
E_H2_Main_10_38,"Only one last stage to go..."
E_H2_Main_10_39,"Everything is going as planned."
E_H2_Main_10_40,"It would be awfully exciting at the end? Hahaha!"
E_H2_Main_10_41,"Arrgh.. My head..."
E_H2_Main_10_42,"I was around to meet High Priestess Iris... What happened to me?"
E_H2_Main_10_43,"Ouch... Are you okay?"
E_H2_Main_10_44,"Kugh, I'm fine."
E_H2_Main_10_45,"I'm not sure what just happened..."
E_H2_Main_10_46,"I remember that I needed to visit Orvel Castle to have a talk with Princess Scarlet."
E_H2_Main_10_47,"But everything else is so fuzzy... Argh."
E_H2_Main_10_48,"Ugh, what's that unpleasant thing over there?"
E_H2_Main_10_49,"It doesn't seem that I can do something about it now but..."
E_H2_Main_10_50,"I should definitely kill it later."
E_H2_Main_11_1,"Huh... What's that?"
E_H2_Main_11_2,"Is that an evil spirit? It looks almost like the Dark Lord."
E_H2_Main_11_3,"Hm hm. Those two are both pretty good-looking."
E_H2_Main_11_4,"Maybe I could seduce them..."
E_H2_Main_11_5,"Hmm, the Dark Lord..."
E_H2_Main_11_6,"Why are they acting like that?"
E_H2_Main_11_7,"They're just staring at us without saying anything."
E_H2_Main_11_8,"Well?"
E_H2_Main_11_9,"Can't they speak at all?"
E_H2_Main_11_10,"We ran into some talkative ones, but that doesn't mean there can't be any quiet ones."
E_H2_Main_11_11,"They look quiet and dangerous. Doesn't that make them more charming?"
E_H2_Main_11_12,"Hahaha, yes, they look dangerous."
E_H2_Main_11_13,"They're the scariest-looking evil spirits we've seen so far."
E_H2_Main_11_14,"And it seems there are a lot of evil spirits inside them, too."
E_H2_Main_11_15,"Are we in danger?"
E_H2_Main_11_16,"Haha, evil spirits are just evil spirits. It won't be any different from our previous battles."
E_H2_Main_11_17,"It might not be easy, but you can do it."
E_H2_Main_11_18,"Oh, I know I told you, Epis, but you can't fight with all your strength."
E_H2_Main_11_19,"It's okay. Jane will protect me. Right, Jane?"
E_H2_Main_11_20,"...?"
E_H2_Main_11_21,"Jane!"
E_H2_Main_11_22,"Stop fooling around and stand in the front."
E_H2_Main_11_23,"We can't attract evil spirits without you."
E_H2_Main_11_24,"Let's move quickly and get this over with."
E_H2_Main_11_25,"Vi...!"
E_H2_Main_12_1,"Kugh!"
E_H2_Main_12_2,"Argh.."
E_H2_Main_12_3,"Wow. They really didn't say anything until the fight was over."
E_H2_Main_12_4,"They're men of few words! I like that!"
E_H2_Main_12_5,"I might just let these evil spirits go."
E_H2_Main_12_6,"That's not for you to decide."
E_H2_Main_12_7,"Arrrgh, I know!"
E_H2_Main_12_8,"...."
E_H2_Main_12_9,"...."
E_H2_Main_12_10,"?"
E_H2_Main_12_11,"What? Do you have anything to say to me?"
E_H2_Main_12_12,"Darn it! I can't do this anymore."
E_H2_Main_12_13,"Hey! I can't fight if you're forcing me to look cool and silent!"
E_H2_Main_12_14,"The whole idea that people would avoid picking fights with cool, quiet men is stupid."
E_H2_Main_12_15,"Hahaha... Ahahaha... Maybe we were wrong."
E_H2_Main_12_16,"But tell me, we were cool, weren't we?"
E_H2_Main_12_17,"Quiet, yet full of dignity. We were like proud knights!"
E_H2_Main_12_18,"You can say whatever you want, but we lost. We're losers."
E_H2_Main_12_19,"Well, that's... well..."
E_H2_Main_12_20,"&!*$&!*$&!*$&!*$"
E_H2_Main_12_21,"...."
E_H2_Main_12_22,"HEY."
E_H2_Main_12_23,"?"
E_H2_Main_12_24,"You're breaking character!"
E_H2_Main_12_25,"Eek!!!"
E_H2_Main_12_26,"Hmm, I've told you many times... You're not allowed to use your full power."
E_H2_Main_12_27,"Eek.. Argh.."
E_H2_Main_12_28,"Phew! This feels amazing! I've been feeling a lot of stress for 100 years,"
E_H2_Main_12_29,"and now I feel like I blew off some steam."
E_H2_Main_12_30,"Did you say something about me, Epis?"
E_H2_Main_12_31,"Or, should I say, Epis the defiant, who just went on a rampage, ignoring what I told you?"
E_H2_Main_12_32,"Eek! It's nothing!"
E_H2_Main_12_33,"I just made them unable to run away! I didn't finish them off completely!"
E_H2_Main_12_34,"Phew... All right. I'll let this go. Hahaha."
E_H2_Main_12_35,"Okay, let's wrap this up."
E_H2_Main_12_36,"Vi, Ezekiel. They're all yours."
E_H2_Main_12_37,"Aww.. *Cough, cough*"
E_H2_Main_12_38,"Argh... My head... What just happened?"
E_H2_Main_12_39,"I can't remember a thing..."
E_H2_Main_12_40,"Oh, right! I was about to give out candies to the kids in the orphanage."
E_H2_Main_12_41,"Then suddenly some black smoke wrapped around me..."
E_H2_Main_12_42,"Kugh... my memory... It's all fuzzy again."
E_H2_Main_12_43,"I had to come to the Princess to escort her."
E_H2_Main_12_44,"But what's grandpa of Clause doing here?"
E_H2_Main_12_45,"Did I fall asleep while walking? And the grandpa looks like he's been possessed or something."
E_H2_Main_12_46,"Hmm, both of them look more handsome when they're not talking."
E_H2_Main_12_47,"Well, but I can't say they aren't cute as they are."
E_H2_Main_12_48,"Stop talking nonsense and let's go."
E_H2_Main_12_49,"You're wasting time!"
E_H2_Main_12_50,"Come on! A girl's got to have a moment to appreciate pretty things!"
E_H2_Main_12_51,"Stop being so bossy, Vi!"
E_H2_Main_12_52,"The longer you goof off, the more Viska will want to kill you when she wakes up."
E_H2_Main_12_53,"Is that how you want it to be?"
E_H2_Main_12_54,"Eek, absolutely not."
E_H2_Main_13_1,"Well, our ghost-busting has come to an end."
E_H2_Main_13_2,"I can't sense any evil spirits around here."
E_H2_Main_13_3,"Ewww, it's been too long."
E_H2_Main_13_4,"Let us go!"
E_H2_Main_13_5,"I should lift the curse from the two of you as well."
E_H2_Main_13_6,"Do you feel you have better control over your body?"
E_H2_Main_13_7,"Umm, I'm not sure why, but it's getting easier to use this power."
E_H2_Main_13_8,"Have I become used to controlling the demon blood without Viska's help?"
E_H2_Main_13_9,"It's because of the dark energy scattered around here."
E_H2_Main_13_10,"The higher number of evil spirits means the energy of darkness around here is more condensed."
E_H2_Main_13_11,"It can be a great source of energy for Demons."
E_H2_Main_13_12,"It's like how clean air is vital to humans."
E_H2_Main_13_13,"Unlike Epis and me, the three of you haven't experienced Pandemonium in your bodies, so it must have helped you greatly."
E_H2_Main_13_14,"Of course,"
E_H2_Main_13_15,"please don't think I did all this for free."
E_H2_Main_13_16,"Argh... What have you...?"
E_H2_Main_13_17,"....!!!"
E_H2_Main_13_18,"Kuh... Shamilla!"
E_H2_Main_13_19,"You mean, selfish witch!"
E_H2_Main_13_20,"Kugh!?"
E_H2_Main_13_21,"..."
E_H2_Main_13_22,"Kuaaaaah!"
E_H2_Main_13_23,"Get lost! I won't be able to sleep tonight if I can't take a swing at that demon's face!"
E_H2_Main_13_24,"N-no! You should calm yourself!"
E_H2_Main_13_25,"Shut up, you weakling!"
E_H2_Main_13_26,"If you're not willing to let me take over..."
E_H2_Main_13_27,"I have no choice but to..."
E_H2_Main_13_28,"Kuahh!"
E_H2_Main_13_29,"..."
E_H2_Main_13_30,"....?"
E_H2_Main_13_31,"Zzzzzz..."
E_H2_Main_13_32,"Hey! ...Hey?"
E_H2_Main_13_33,"Hahaha, thank you very much for helping me today, all of you."
E_H2_Main_13_34,"It was all worth the trouble, making you exorcise evil spirits on your own and letting you absorb the darkness at a close distance."
E_H2_Main_13_35,"...?"
E_H2_Main_13_36,"Hahaha, those are all parts of you."
E_H2_Main_13_37,"They are the darkness that sits inside you. Your weakness, vulnerability, or maybe a forgotten past memory."
E_H2_Main_13_38,"Evil spirits do not die. They become scattered temporarily, or they get sent to a different place through an exorcism, but they can't die."
E_H2_Main_13_39,"The bits of astral composites you exorcised, along with their lingering wills, have permeated your minds."
E_H2_Main_13_40,"If your demon selves were awake, you could have noticed it right away, but..."
E_H2_Main_13_41,"Kugh, you make me feel sick."
E_H2_Main_13_42,"Do you know how unpleasant it is to share a body with such wimpy idiots?"
E_H2_Main_13_43,"I couldn't agree more, Crab Legs!"
E_H2_Main_13_44,"It felt so freaking terrible to be surrounded by evil spirits, you Witch!"
E_H2_Main_13_45,"I can't just let this be!"
E_H2_Main_13_46,"Hey, take it easy."
E_H2_Main_13_47,"I just wanted to give the three of you what you needed."
E_H2_Main_13_48,"Hmph. Nonsense!"
E_H2_Main_13_49,"You just wanted to enjoy this situation!"
E_H2_Main_13_50,"My human self is too weak to use my powers!"
E_H2_Main_13_51,"He should have just sat in the corner and stayed quiet. He doesn't need to be trained for anything!"
E_H2_Main_13_52,"Sh-shut up!"
E_H2_Main_13_53,"Wh-what!?"
E_H2_Main_13_54,"It's my body, too!"
E_H2_Main_13_55,"She didn't hurt us at all! She gave me the chance to take control over my body and the demon blood!"
E_H2_Main_13_56,"You always did what you felt like doing till now."
E_H2_Main_13_57,"It's my turn to be in control!"
E_H2_Main_13_58,"I'll be moving my own body today!"
E_H2_Main_13_59,"Wow!"
E_H2_Main_13_60,"He can be quite intimidating when things get heated up."
E_H2_Main_13_61,"..."
E_H2_Main_13_62,"Huff... Argh...."
E_H2_Main_13_63,"...."
E_H2_Main_13_64,"You.. weakling!"
E_H2_Main_13_65,"I don't think you have what it takes, but you definitely grew some balls."
E_H2_Main_13_66,"Psh, fine. Do whatever you'd like then."
E_H2_Main_13_67,"....?"
E_H2_Main_13_68,"Why do you think I was born?"
E_H2_Main_13_69,"Because you were too afraid of demon blood? Yes, partly."
E_H2_Main_13_70,"But mostly I was born to protect your feeble self."
E_H2_Main_13_71,"But... it seems I won't be able to coddle you for too long. Hahaha."
E_H2_Main_13_72,"..."
E_H2_Main_13_73,"Good luck, human."
E_H2_Main_13_74,"I'll be watching you from here."
E_H2_Main_13_75,"But don't forget."
E_H2_Main_13_76,"When you're in danger, I'm taking control over this body."
E_H2_Main_13_77,"Huff... Argh....."
E_H2_Main_13_78,"That was..."
E_H2_Main_13_79,"...Hmm. So that's how this goes."
E_H2_Main_13_80,"You, Half Breed. Hahaha. Well, struggling wimps are always fun to watch."
E_H2_Main_13_81,"If that's his decision, I should respect it."
E_H2_Main_13_82,"...?!"
E_H2_Main_13_83,"Huh?"
E_H2_Main_13_84,"Viska...?"
E_H2_Main_13_85,"Why, you don't like it? I'm giving you a chance to fight."
E_H2_Main_13_86,"They're not the Demons that you hate the most... but then, evil spirits are not completely different from Demons, either."
E_H2_Main_13_87,"It doesn't look like it'd be tasty. Do whatever you want."
E_H2_Main_13_88,"....."
E_H2_Main_13_89,"Thank you."
E_H2_Main_13_90,"Hahaha, so all of you seem to be ready."
E_H2_Main_13_91,"...Yes."
E_H2_Main_13_92,"Yes, we're ready to go at any time."
E_H2_Main_13_93,"*Giggle* Then please exterminate the darkness in front of you."
E_H2_Main_13_94,"I'll have something very helpful ready for you when you're done. *Giggle*"
E_H2_Main_14_1,"This energy... I feel refreshed... I can clearly feel the demon power in my body."
E_H2_Main_14_2,"And all these memories..."
E_H2_Main_14_3,"Are these Viska's memories from when she was in Pandemonium?"
E_H2_Main_14_4,"The things my demon self was doing... The people she met... The things she felt..."
E_H2_Main_14_5,"Jane...Jane... Ah! I know! She's the princess that Theo was looking for."
E_H2_Main_14_6,"Then she is..."
E_H2_Main_14_7,"Hahaha, as I told you, that is the darkness mixed in with your will."
E_H2_Main_14_8,"If you choose to strip off the darkness and absorb it, you'll be able to recover your lost memories and the scattered bits of your potential."
E_H2_Main_14_9,"And of course, I told you I'll get something in return."
E_H2_Main_14_10,"I'll collect the vast amount of darkness that remains."
E_H2_Main_14_11,"My head hurts... My heart, too..."
E_H2_Main_14_12,"Is this... pain?"
E_H2_Main_14_13,"No... it's different."
E_H2_Main_14_14,"Something stirring in me... happy, yet sad..."
E_H2_Main_14_15,"Haha, I guess you've remembered something."
E_H2_Main_14_16,"...Yeah."
E_H2_Main_14_17,"I have..."
E_H2_Main_14_18,"It's my memory..."
E_H2_Main_14_19,"But it's not the memory of the present me."
E_H2_Main_14_20,"Huh? What do you mean?"
E_H2_Main_14_21,"This is... the memory of Jane Grey, the princess of Republic of Gray..."
E_H2_Main_14_22,"I'm an undead... made with Jane's corpse..."
E_H2_Main_14_23,"I'm Jane, but..."
E_H2_Main_14_24,"I'm not the same Jane I used to be..."
E_H2_Main_14_25,"I can't say that this is my own memory..."
E_H2_Main_14_26,"Umm, Mr. Handsome might find it very frustrating when he hears this."
E_H2_Main_14_27,"But... I want to know."
E_H2_Main_14_28,"The old me... The real Jane..."
E_H2_Main_14_29,"I can't go back, and I could never become who I used to be before I died..."
E_H2_Main_14_30,"If... if only I could start all over again..."
E_H2_Main_14_31,"..."
E_H2_Main_14_32,"Phew, Jane, you cutie!"
E_H2_Main_14_33,"How adorable!"
E_H2_Main_14_34,"*Giggle* So, that's your answer."
E_H2_Main_14_35,"Just as I expected, you're as interesting as your knight."
E_H2_Main_14_36,"Now, it's all over, right?"
E_H2_Main_14_37,"Right?"
E_H2_Main_14_38,"I can take these clothes off yet, right?"
E_H2_Main_14_39,"..."
E_H2_Main_14_40,"Oh, not quite."
E_H2_Main_14_41,"Huuuh?"
E_H2_Main_14_42,"Oops."
E_H2_Main_14_43,"Angels are angels. I've cast a curse to make you absorb evil spirits, but to no avail."
E_H2_Main_14_44,"You've purified everything in less than a day."
E_H2_Main_14_45,"I even dressed you as fallen angels. What a disappointment."
E_H2_Main_14_46,"*Huff, huff* Shut up, Demon!"
E_H2_Main_14_47,"Do you think you can just get away after what you've done to us?"
E_H2_Main_14_48,"Hahaha, why, of course I do."
E_H2_Main_14_49,"I can see that my curse is still affecting you. Don't push yourself."
E_H2_Main_14_50,"Farewell, then."
E_H2_Main_14_51,"...?!"
E_H2_Main_14_52,"..."
E_H2_Main_14_53,"..."
E_H2_Main_14_54,"Argh... we lost her, but..."
E_H2_Main_14_55,"I won't let you go!"
E_H2_Main_14_56,"Face the judgment of light, Demon!"
E_H2_Main_14_57,"Aww, darn!"
E_H2_Main_14_58,"Shamilla, you dirty witch!"
E_H2_Main_14_59,"You'll pay for this!"
E_H2_Main_14_60,"...What should we do..?"
E_H2_Main_14_61,"Fighting the Angels?"
E_H2_Main_14_62,"Well, we don't have much choice."
E_H2_Main_14_63,"They won't just let us run."
E_H2_Main_14_64,"We should knock them down or stun them quickly, and then get going."
E_H2_Main_14_65,"They don't look so well, either. Maybe it won't be too hard."
E_H2_Main_14_66,"But Vi, you don't seem to be well enough to fight. Let me be in charge."
E_H2_Main_14_67,"Alright. Thank you, Viska."
E_H2_Main_14_68,"Fighting angels...? This is a little..."
E_H2_Main_14_69,"Don't chicken out now, you wimp!"
E_H2_Main_14_70,"But this can get really dangerous. Move away and take some rest."
E_H2_Main_14_71,"Hey, Crab Legs! We can do this, can't we?"
E_H2_Main_14_72,"Well, nothing's impossible."
E_H2_Main_14_73,"It's frustrating to admit that Shamilla actually did something for us,"
E_H2_Main_14_74,"but the stronger our human sides grow, the more powerful we become."
E_H2_Main_14_75,"I feel sleepy. We should end this quickly..."
E_H2_Main_14_76,"Stop talking, you three! Come and help!"
E_C2_Main_0_1,"It's Christmas again."
E_C2_Main_0_2,"It's your first time here in Orvel since summer, isn't it?"
E_C2_Main_0_3,"Yeah, I think so."
E_C2_Main_0_4,"Heh heh, after all this time, I finally get to see my grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_0_5,"I sure hope Grandpa Ricardo is doing alright..."
E_C2_Main_0_6,"I'm sure he's well."
E_C2_Main_0_7,"Even at his age, he's still strong and resilient."
E_C2_Main_0_8,"I bet he's in his Santa costume, giving out presents to the kids in the orphanage right now."
E_C2_Main_0_9,"Or maybe he's busy running around the entire city doing that."
E_C2_Main_0_10,"Heh heh, I like it when Grandpa dresses up as Santa,"
E_C2_Main_0_11,"but I like these cute Christmas costumes, too!"
E_C2_Main_0_12,"May's handmade costumes are so beautiful."
E_C2_Main_0_13,"Haha, yes, totally."
E_C2_Main_0_14,"May has some amazing skills."
E_C2_Main_0_15,"But Sonia, why did we come here to Orvel all of a sudden?"
E_C2_Main_0_16,"Did you get a request from the Tower of Sage?"
E_C2_Main_0_17,"You know I don't run errands for the Tower of Sage."
E_C2_Main_0_18,"I really hate that they gave me this weird title. I'm not even part of their group..."
E_C2_Main_0_19,"I've said it before. I don't want to get involved with any wizards and alchemists."
E_C2_Main_0_20,"Heh heh, I remember."
E_C2_Main_0_21,"Well, technically, it's a request from the guild."
E_C2_Main_0_22,"You've heard about the legend of Santa, haven't you?"
E_C2_Main_0_23,"One of the greatest saints who coerced one of the ancient monsters called Beast Rudolph into submission and used him as his servant"
E_C2_Main_0_24,"in slaying countless demons."
E_C2_Main_0_25,"Yeah, I know that story."
E_C2_Main_0_26,"Grandpa Ricardo used to read it to me."
E_C2_Main_0_27,"It's been said that the beast's blood was shed from that battle and seeped into the ground near Orvel."
E_C2_Main_0_28,"The pine trees in the land grew on this blood and became powerful vessels of Mana."
E_C2_Main_0_29,"Apparently, the trees awaken once every 20 years on Christmas Eve."
E_C2_Main_0_30,"And tonight is supposed to be the night."
E_C2_Main_0_31,"Oh... I see!"
E_C2_Main_0_32,"So, are we going to find those trees?"
E_C2_Main_0_33,"Well, at the very least, I need to look into it."
E_C2_Main_0_34,"The enormous amount of Mana in them is said to attract monsters and even demons."
E_C2_Main_0_35,"I cannot let that just happen."
E_C2_Main_0_36,"And if the trees really hold such great Mana..."
E_C2_Main_0_37,"They could be the catalyst I need for this magic I want to use."
E_C2_Main_0_38,"Um? Sonia, what did you say?"
E_C2_Main_0_39,"Oh, uh, n-nothing."
E_C2_Main_0_40,"Okay, let's hurry!"
E_C2_Main_1_1,"Umm... but I remember reading that the beast was huge."
E_C2_Main_1_2,"How big was it, really?"
E_C2_Main_1_3,"Was it as big as a castle? A mountain? Maybe a dragon?"
E_C2_Main_1_4,"No way."
E_C2_Main_1_5,"I'm sure the stories were exaggerating. It can't possibly be as big as a dragon..."
E_C2_Main_1_6,"Yeesh, it's freaking cold!"
E_C2_Main_1_7,"This is all your fault, Lilia!"
E_C2_Main_1_8,"Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous!"
E_C2_Main_1_9,"This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been so desperate for my sister's attention!"
E_C2_Main_1_10,"What'd you say? You brat!"
E_C2_Main_1_11,"That's right, you knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_1_12,"Hahaha, stop fighting."
E_C2_Main_1_13,"Did you forget why Laias sent two of you to me?"
E_C2_Main_1_14,"She wanted me to help you guys stop arguing."
E_C2_Main_1_15,"Shut up, Human!"
E_C2_Main_1_16,"How dare you speak to a great Black Dragon in such a manner?"
E_C2_Main_1_17,"Ha!"
E_C2_Main_1_18,"Arghhh!"
E_C2_Main_1_19,"Haha, that's what you get."
E_C2_Main_1_20,"What? You bra-"
E_C2_Main_1_21,"Hyah!"
E_C2_Main_1_22,"Guh!"
E_C2_Main_1_23,"Urgh, if only you weren't a friend of Laias!"
E_C2_Main_1_24,"Now, now. Settle down."
E_C2_Main_1_25,"I'm sure you're here to get Laias a great Christmas tree, right?"
E_C2_Main_1_26,"Wasn't it you that wanted to make a Christmas tree out of a legendary pine tree?"
E_C2_Main_1_27,"Psh.. Okay, okay. I get it!"
E_C2_Main_1_28,"Whatever! Hmph."
E_C2_Main_1_29,"…."
E_C2_Main_1_30,"Did he say he was a dragon?"
E_C2_Main_1_31,"A dragon..."
E_C2_Main_1_32,"Umm, I don't think the dragons in the books looked that adorable..."
E_C2_Main_1_33,"They said something about a legendary pine tree too."
E_C2_Main_1_34,"Let's follow them, Mirianne!"
E_C2_Main_2_1,"According to the legend, the forest is located north of Orvel..."
E_C2_Main_2_2,"Every year, only a handful of trees in the forest awaken."
E_C2_Main_2_3,"One or two of them is what we might expect."
E_C2_Main_2_4,"Haha, if Esker were around, things would have been much easier for us."
E_C2_Main_2_5,"We definitely could use some of his luck."
E_C2_Main_2_6,"...Hello? Are you listening, you two?"
E_C2_Main_2_7,"Huh, I could do this on my own."
E_C2_Main_2_8,"And why in the world do I have to wear these clothes?"
E_C2_Main_2_9,"Traditionally, priests of the Church of Lua walk around nearby towns every Christmas,"
E_C2_Main_2_10,"singing praises, praying for people, and blessing them."
E_C2_Main_2_11,"And this is what they would wear when they're at it."
E_C2_Main_2_12,"But since you two have nothing to wear for the winter,"
E_C2_Main_2_13,"I told May your age and height, and the clothes came out to fit you just right."
E_C2_Main_2_14,"Oh, and since she wouldn't know much about your age as a dragon, I sort of guessed your human age from your looks and told her that."
E_C2_Main_2_15,"That's not what I wanted to know!"
E_C2_Main_2_16,"This is uncomfortable beyond imagination, I'm just going to tear..."
E_C2_Main_2_17,"Oh, and Laias paid for those clothes."
E_C2_Main_2_18,"So, in a way, you can consider them a present from Laias, I guess. Hahaha..."
E_C2_Main_2_19,"…!"
E_C2_Main_2_20,"*Clears throat* Well, I guess I'll have to wear them, then."
E_C2_Main_2_21,"It won't kill to wear these for a day or two."
E_C2_Main_2_22,"Tsk tsk..."
E_C2_Main_2_23,"What! Do you have a problem?"
E_C2_Main_2_24,"Anyway..."
E_C2_Main_2_25,"Hey, why don't you show yourselves?"
E_C2_Main_2_26,"Stop hiding like rats!"
E_C2_Main_2_27,"…!"
E_C2_Main_2_28,"Hmm, I must say, I'm very surprised to see you."
E_C2_Main_2_29,"Archmage of Blue, the one who casts chantless lightning spells with no effort at all."
E_C2_Main_2_30,"...Hmm, you... You're not a human, are you?"
E_C2_Main_2_31,"You're a Homunculus. An imitation of life made by humans..."
E_C2_Main_2_32,"And the other one is... a Half Elf."
E_C2_Main_2_33,"Hmph, I guess like attracts like, after all."
E_C2_Main_2_34,"…"
E_C2_Main_2_35,"*Sigh* Neraxis, you don't say such things to people you've never met before..."
E_C2_Main_2_36,"Words can hurt, knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_2_37,"Anyway, why were you following us?"
E_C2_Main_2_38,"Oh, umm... Actually..."
E_C2_Main_2_39,"Ms. Dragon...?"
E_C2_Main_2_40,"Oh, I did not introduce myself to you."
E_C2_Main_2_41,"I am Lilia, younger sister of Laias the Water Dragon, and one of the dragons guarding Aegina Desert."
E_C2_Main_2_42,"And this knucklehead here is Neraxis."
E_C2_Main_2_43,"He's a headache my sister picked up from somewhere."
E_C2_Main_2_44,"Hey!"
E_C2_Main_2_45,"I am Lucias, the priest from the Church of Lua."
E_C2_Main_2_46,"I had a chance to acquaint myself with Laias."
E_C2_Main_2_47,"And so, I am on a journey with these two dragons."
E_C2_Main_2_48,"I... I am..."
E_C2_Main_2_49,"Relax. I know we're dragons, but you don't have to be so nervous."
E_C2_Main_2_50,"Huh! Whatever."
E_C2_Main_2_51,"Umm... Then, we'll try."
E_C2_Main_2_52,"The title... Archmage of whatever... It makes me feel weird."
E_C2_Main_2_53,"Please just call me Sonia."
E_C2_Main_2_54,"The Tower of Sage just started to call me that without my consent..."
E_C2_Main_2_55,"I see..."
E_C2_Main_2_56,"My apologies, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_2_57,"But I'm afraid our talk will have to wait."
E_C2_Main_2_58,"...What?"
E_C2_Main_2_59,"Monsters... So many of them!"
E_C2_Main_2_60,"Huh, they're just monsters!"
E_C2_Main_2_61,"Die, you trash!"
E_C2_Main_3_1,"I expected more from them since they were drawn here by the legendary forest..."
E_C2_Main_3_2,"Hmph, I'm not even warmed up yet!"
E_C2_Main_3_3,"Now, let's get back to what we were talking about."
E_C2_Main_3_4,"Is there anything that we can do for you two?"
E_C2_Main_3_5,"Oh, we happened to overhear you talking about the legendary tree..."
E_C2_Main_3_6,"We're also looking for that."
E_C2_Main_3_7,"Huh? No way! That tree is ours to take."
E_C2_Main_3_8,"I promised Laias that I would show her the best Christmas tree ever."
E_C2_Main_3_9,"Hahaha, let's find the tree first and then we'll see."
E_C2_Main_3_10,"Umm?"
E_C2_Main_3_11,"What's wrong?"
E_C2_Main_3_12,"Why did you stop all of a sudden?"
E_C2_Main_3_13,"Ahahaha, it's just that"
E_C2_Main_3_14,"we found the tree way a lot sooner than we thought."
E_C2_Main_3_15,"Wow... Is this the legendary tree? But it's..."
E_C2_Main_3_16,"It doesn't look so special at all!"
E_C2_Main_3_17,"It's just a bit big and it seems to contain quite a lot of Mana.."
E_C2_Main_3_18,"It's a tree, knucklehead. That's about as different as it gets."
E_C2_Main_3_19,"Hmph, only knuckleheads would call someone else a knucklehead, knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_3_20,"!@#$%@#$%!!!"
E_C2_Main_3_21,"Haiz, I'm not able to stop the two of you..."
E_C2_Main_3_22,"…"
E_C2_Main_3_23,"...Hmm, you are the 7th group to arrive."
E_C2_Main_3_24,"A human, dragons, and two children of a chaotic nature..."
E_C2_Main_3_25,"?!"
E_C2_Main_3_26,"The tree talks!?"
E_C2_Main_3_27,"I was born from the blood of Rudolph, the ancient monster."
E_C2_Main_3_28,"I am reborn, every once in 20 years,"
E_C2_Main_3_29,"to grant wishes for people with the power in me."
E_C2_Main_3_30,"Now, tell me your wish."
E_C2_Main_3_31,"A wish..."
E_C2_Main_3_32,"Hm hm, I'll pass."
E_C2_Main_3_33,"I'm not so desperate for something that I have to get it from a tree."
E_C2_Main_3_34,"What about you two?"
E_C2_Main_3_35,"Forget about wishes. What's the deal, do we pull up that tree by the roots?"
E_C2_Main_3_36,"You're going to a desert, but don't worry. We'll water you well."
E_C2_Main_3_37,"….?!"
E_C2_Main_3_38,"Whoa, wait! Wait!"
E_C2_Main_3_39,"Are you people mad?"
E_C2_Main_3_40,"Sane people would think of their wishes first in situations like this!"
E_C2_Main_3_41,"Huh? The tree is talking differently now."
E_C2_Main_3_42,"Was it pretending to be serious and solemn back then?"
E_C2_Main_3_43,"Yes, it seems so..."
E_C2_Main_3_44,"Hmm! Anyway..."
E_C2_Main_3_45,"You are the last visitors today."
E_C2_Main_3_46,"Now that the teams are set, everything is ready now."
E_C2_Main_3_47,"Normally, a team should only contain 2 or 3 people in it, but since I don't feel like thinking today, you can all move as a team."
E_C2_Main_3_48,"You can choose 2 people to send out for battle. I think that should be alright."
E_C2_Main_3_49,"???"
E_C2_Main_3_50,"Why should I team up with these wimps?"
E_C2_Main_3_51,"Why should I team up with this knucklehead?"
E_C2_Main_3_52,"Hahahaha..."
E_C2_Main_3_53,"I couldn't care less what you feel."
E_C2_Main_3_54,"Only the last team standing could have their wish come true!"
E_C2_Main_3_55,"Now, let the game begin."
E_C2_Main_3_56,"That's it for explaining the rules. Teleport!"
E_C2_Main_3_57,"Rejoice, good children of Christmas! Your wish will be granted!"
E_C2_Main_3_58,"Then, may luck be with you!"
E_C2_Main_3_59,"What, wait....."
E_C2_Main_3_60,"Ugh... my head... Where am I...?"
E_C2_Main_3_61,"Is everyone all right?"
E_C2_Main_3_62,"Huh, that tree, what did it do...?"
E_C2_Main_3_63,"Hmm?"
E_C2_Main_3_64,"Kyahahahahaha!"
E_C2_Main_3_65,"I'll mop the floor with whoever gets in my way!"
E_C2_Main_3_66,"My wish will come true!"
E_C2_Main_3_67,"*Sigh* Why am I here?"
E_C2_Main_3_68,"I shouldn't leave Cleo alone for too long."
E_C2_Main_3_69,"I promise it'll be quick!"
E_C2_Main_3_70,"Hmph, know your place, human."
E_C2_Main_3_71,"These jerks... I'll fry you with black lightning!"
E_C2_Main_3_72,"Bahahaha!"
E_C2_Main_3_73,"Hmm, I think we don't have a choice."
E_C2_Main_3_74,"We can let 2 people in a battle, right?"
E_C2_Main_3_75,"Please Lilia, make sure Neraxis doesn't go on a rampage."
E_C2_Main_3_76,"Aww, every single time!"
E_C2_Main_4_1,"Argh, I could have become an adult again!"
E_C2_Main_4_2,"Boo! I hate you!"
E_C2_Main_4_3,"Phew, thank heavens it ended fast."
E_C2_Main_4_4,"Cleo… you better not make me run petty errands like this again."
E_C2_Main_4_5,"You're going to get in trouble…"
E_C2_Main_4_6,"Tsk, they weren't half bad for humans."
E_C2_Main_4_7,"By the way, how many of these pointless fights do we have to do?"
E_C2_Main_4_8,"This is killing me. I should have pulled that tree as soon as I found it!"
E_C2_Main_4_9,"Don't be ignorant, you knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_4_10,"Stop pushing and making this harder than it already is!"
E_C2_Main_4_11,"Those humans could have been seriously hurt!"
E_C2_Main_4_12,"Do you want to tarnish my sister's name?"
E_C2_Main_4_13,"Stop calling me knucklehead, you brat!"
E_C2_Main_4_14,"Don't you see me trying to control my powers here?"
E_C2_Main_4_15,"Look at that mess over there and say you're controlling your power again!"
E_C2_Main_4_16,"You've burnt everything! It's scorched everywhere!"
E_C2_Main_4_17,"!@#$%@#$%!!!"
E_C2_Main_4_18,"Umm, it seems we're in a demiplane separated from our dimension,"
E_C2_Main_4_19,"a world that we cannot escape unless we win or lose."
E_C2_Main_4_20,"And a smaller barrier surrounds us when we encounter enemies."
E_C2_Main_4_21,"Although it's gone after each battle ends..."
E_C2_Main_4_22,"That is, we need to defeat all the other teams to escape this place as winners."
E_C2_Main_4_23,"This is getting all too serious..."
E_C2_Main_4_24,"All I wanted to do was investigate the tree..."
E_C2_Main_4_25,"Heh heh, you're strong, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_4_26,"You'll be able to end this quickly!"
E_C2_Main_4_27,"Oh, well... I guess so.. Hahaha.."
E_C2_Main_4_28,"We do have two very feisty dragons on our side as well."
E_C2_Main_4_29,"We'll work it out somehow."
E_C2_Main_4_30,"Ahahaha....."
E_C2_Main_4_31,"*Sigh*"
E_C2_Main_4_32,"The two of you, please."
E_C2_Main_4_33,"Stop causing"
E_C2_Main_4_34,"more trouble."
E_C2_Main_4_35,"Heeeeek!"
E_C2_Main_5_1,"So, to sum it up,"
E_C2_Main_5_2,"we are in the demiplane created by the legendary tree."
E_C2_Main_5_3,"And there are others in a similar situation as us, whom we'd have to fight in order to get out."
E_C2_Main_5_4,"Yes, that seems like the only way to go."
E_C2_Main_5_5,"We might find another way if we had more time..."
E_C2_Main_5_6,"Aww, this is too much hassle!"
E_C2_Main_5_7,"I just want to get this over with and go see Laias!"
E_C2_Main_5_8,"Hahaha, your love for Laias never ceases to amaze me."
E_C2_Main_5_9,"There's nothing to worry about. If we work together,"
E_C2_Main_5_10,"we can easily get to the bottom of this."
E_C2_Main_5_11,"Darn, I hate having to work together with this knucklehead."
E_C2_Main_5_12,"Right back at you! Do you think I enjoy working with you, brat?"
E_C2_Main_5_13,"Ahahaha....."
E_C2_Main_5_14,"Shouldn't we try to make them get along or something?"
E_C2_Main_5_15,"They're making me nervous."
E_C2_Main_5_16,"Well, as surprising as this may sound, they actually make a pretty good team."
E_C2_Main_5_17,"No matter how often they might argue over the smallest things, they both love Laias so much."
E_C2_Main_5_18,"They would never do anything that would make Laias sad."
E_C2_Main_5_19,"Laias...?"
E_C2_Main_5_20,"I think I've heard the name before..."
E_C2_Main_5_21,"Oh, I think I read it in a book somewhere!"
E_C2_Main_5_22,"I believe it was the book about the legends of Aegina Desert..."
E_C2_Main_5_23,"God Dragon Laias."
E_C2_Main_5_24,"An ancient dragon that has been protecting the desert kingdom Sekireinel since forever ago..."
E_C2_Main_5_25,"Beloved by Cain, the king of Sekireinel..."
E_C2_Main_5_26,"Cain!?"
E_C2_Main_5_27,"That little, pretentious human jerk? Yuck!"
E_C2_Main_5_28,"He's been dead for hundreds of years and then gets brought back to life all of a sudden? All he does is talk!"
E_C2_Main_5_29,"Every day, he keeps showing up at the Shrine of Flow and proposing to Laias!"
E_C2_Main_5_30,"Ewww, I feel sick just thinking about him."
E_C2_Main_5_31,"That little fly! I should never have let him near Laias in the first place!"
E_C2_Main_5_32,"Zafir and Laudia don't visit us as much anymore!"
E_C2_Main_5_33,"It's all... because of that fly!"
E_C2_Main_5_34,"Haha... See?"
E_C2_Main_5_35,"Ahahaha....."
E_C2_Main_6_1,"Umm? A building in a place like this?"
E_C2_Main_6_2,"I can see the light through the window. Could somebody be in there?"
E_C2_Main_6_3,"…!!"
E_C2_Main_6_4,"...A barrier is cast over us, just like when we fought those two people."
E_C2_Main_6_5,"There must be someone there."
E_C2_Main_6_6,"Well, enough talk! Let's get inside!"
E_C2_Main_6_7,"I'm leading!"
E_C2_Main_6_8,"*Sigh* I'm going to kill..."
E_C2_Main_6_9,"Hahaha..."
E_C2_Main_6_10,"Oh, they are..."
E_C2_Main_6_11,"Eh? What? It's a Dwarf!"
E_C2_Main_6_12,"And a Vampire! They say there aren't many of them left."
E_C2_Main_6_13,"Oh, look who's here. And that weapon of yours..."
E_C2_Main_6_14,"I certainly know you by reputation, young Black Dragon."
E_C2_Main_6_15,"I heard that you placed some preposterous orders for my fellow Dwarves,"
E_C2_Main_6_16,"threatened them, and left without paying due price."
E_C2_Main_6_17,"Well, how about I teach a young dragon a thing or two about attitude? I've sure missed doing that!"
E_C2_Main_6_18,"Huh, don't mess with me, you old Dwarf!"
E_C2_Main_6_19,"You have no idea what I'm capable o... Ouch!"
E_C2_Main_6_20,"Stop that, knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_6_21,"That Dwarf is an old acquaintance of my sister!"
E_C2_Main_6_22,"He is one of the heroes who defeated Mad Dragon Temeraire with her!"
E_C2_Main_6_23,"What the...? Whose side are you on now?"
E_C2_Main_6_24,"My sister's!"
E_C2_Main_6_25,"...Hmph!"
E_C2_Main_6_26,"Whoa, Phillop, the last thing I want now is trouble."
E_C2_Main_6_27,"I don't think I've fully recovered yet."
E_C2_Main_6_28,"My head throbs when I hear noise."
E_C2_Main_6_29,"Oh, since when did the Vampires start to celebrate Christmas?"
E_C2_Main_6_30,"Princess of Pure Blood, Lewisia."
E_C2_Main_6_31,"Greetings from the Saint of Blessings, Lucias."
E_C2_Main_6_32,"Hmm, you are the Saint of Blessings for this generation."
E_C2_Main_6_33,"What's there to be surprised at? I have lived among humans for the last 100 years."
E_C2_Main_6_34,"I know how to celebrate Christmas."
E_C2_Main_6_35,"An old acquaintance... Is he Phillop, who fought along with those warriors 100 years ago?"
E_C2_Main_6_36,"That sounds about right. Lorraine should be here somewhere, but I haven't met her yet."
E_C2_Main_6_37,"Hm hm, anyway, the Saint of Blessings for this generation…"
E_C2_Main_6_38,"100 years ago, all the warriors and King Kyle received a lot of help from the one that preceded you."
E_C2_Main_6_39,"Haha, his memories reside in my mind. I'm familiar with that occasion."
E_C2_Main_6_40,"...I bet it's frustrating."
E_C2_Main_6_41,"Carrying so much weight, though you only live so short."
E_C2_Main_6_42,"Previous saints, like all their predecessors, failed to bear the burden of accumulated memories in the end,"
E_C2_Main_6_43,"lost their free will, and ended up being the 'Will of Light.'"
E_C2_Main_6_44,"Unlike 'regular saints' such as the Saint in Red Clothes or the Saintess of Dragons, to whom humans gave their titles,"
E_C2_Main_6_45,"the ones chosen by the Stigmata like yourself are…"
E_C2_Main_6_46,"I know. Those memories are in my head as well."
E_C2_Main_6_47,"But... I am fine, mentally. For now, anyway."
E_C2_Main_6_48,"This is the burden that I need to carry, and the ordeal that I have to overcome."
E_C2_Main_6_49,"Well, if that's how you think..."
E_C2_Main_6_50,"By the way, does being in the barrier mean we must fight each other?"
E_C2_Main_6_51,"Hahaha, I think that's how this is designed."
E_C2_Main_6_52,"But fortunately, I don't think it should be an all-out battle."
E_C2_Main_6_53,"I feel terrible for leaving without seeing Lorraine, but..."
E_C2_Main_6_54,"I will look for her later."
E_C2_Main_6_55,"Then, shall we have a casual fight?"
E_C2_Main_6_56,"Hahaha! Come on, you novice dragon!"
E_C2_Main_6_57,"Urgh!"
E_C2_Main_6_58,"*Sigh* I have no choice but to help you this time. You should be grateful!"
E_C2_Main_6_59,"Hmph, who do you think I am? I am a member of the proud Black Dra..."
E_C2_Main_6_60,"Whatever. Shut your trap and just fight!"
E_C2_Main_6_61,"...Are all dragons like them?"
E_C2_Main_6_62,".....Heh heh, I'm not sure."
E_C2_Main_6_63,"So, we'll have to sit back and watch them fight."
E_C2_Main_6_64,"We should have brought some snacks if this were to happen. Hahaha."
E_C2_Main_6_65,"Oh, we do have snacks. Popcorn, cookies, and other stuff."
E_C2_Main_6_66,"Oh, wonderful. Could I get some popcorn, please?"
E_C2_Main_6_67,"Popcorn is always the way to go when you watch a bout or a show."
E_C2_Main_6_68,"I remember watching Stardust's performance, munching on popcorn. Hahaha..."
E_C2_Main_6_69,"Krrrr!"
E_C2_Main_7_1,"Argh, dang it!"
E_C2_Main_7_2,"You little midget! You're quite nimble!"
E_C2_Main_7_3,"Stop talking, you knucklehead!"
E_C2_Main_7_4,"Can you stop being so rude?!"
E_C2_Main_7_5,"Mmph! Mmph! (You filthy, betraying brat!)"
E_C2_Main_7_6,"That's definitely a weapon made by our best blacksmiths."
E_C2_Main_7_7,"It's packed with power! Hahaha!"
E_C2_Main_7_8,"By the way, I don't think it's appropriate for you to call me little,"
E_C2_Main_7_9,"especially when you're in your current form, not the original form of a dragon."
E_C2_Main_7_10,"Phew, It's finished."
E_C2_Main_7_11,"We lost, but it was fun."
E_C2_Main_7_12,"Even though he's young, he's still a dragon."
E_C2_Main_7_13,"I'm still not in my best condition,"
E_C2_Main_7_14,"but it's great to have a good fight after so long."
E_C2_Main_7_15,"Hmm, you haven't been using your powers recently then?"
E_C2_Main_7_16,"Use my powers? Well, I'm usually in the form of a small child."
E_C2_Main_7_17,"A woman who calls herself the Vampire Hunter started to hang out around me recently."
E_C2_Main_7_18,"Since Vampires in Luthvelia other than myself never cross the border, there shouldn't be any problem."
E_C2_Main_7_19,"However, it seems that Vampires in other continents have lost their pride."
E_C2_Main_7_20,"To think that they've got a hunter chasing them as if they're a bunch of pests that need to be exterminated…"
E_C2_Main_7_21,"Hmm, I think I've heard of something similar."
E_C2_Main_7_22,"There is a mysterious continent in the far east,"
E_C2_Main_7_23,"where humans use beings of darkness like pawns"
E_C2_Main_7_24,"and exorcise evil for a living."
E_C2_Main_7_25,"They seem to have a connection to the Vespia Empire."
E_C2_Main_7_26,"That hunter in Orvis"
E_C2_Main_7_27,"is known to be a member of Shadow Hilt Family in Vespia Empire."
E_C2_Main_7_28,"So I've heard."
E_C2_Main_7_29,"We Dwarves also trade with the empire."
E_C2_Main_7_30,"Some families from the eastern continent,"
E_C2_Main_7_31,"have moved to and settled down in the empire, I heard."
E_C2_Main_7_32,"Oh, come to think of it, I think I've seen a lady from the east at the guild in Orvel."
E_C2_Main_7_33,"Her name was... Turan, I suppose."
E_C2_Main_7_34,"She didn't seem to have any background in exorcism."
E_C2_Main_7_35,"Hmm... I see."
E_C2_Main_7_36,"Ah, it's that tree again. Should we leave now, then?"
E_C2_Main_7_37,"Hahaha, let's get back to Orvel and eat."
E_C2_Main_7_38,"We couldn't find Lorraine, but she will come to Orvel if she can."
E_C2_Main_7_39,"Then, goodbye for now."
E_C2_Main_7_40,"Get ready to be spanked on the butt the next time you see me, Black Dragon kid. Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_7_41,"What?"
E_C2_Main_7_42,"Get lost! I don't want to ever see you again!"
E_C2_Main_7_43,"God, can't he be nice for once..?"
E_C2_Main_7_44,"Hahaha, what can you do? Black Dragons are known for their arrogance."
E_C2_Main_7_45,"It'll be fun to watch him around an ill-tempered Red Dragon."
E_C2_Main_7_46,"Ewww, I get goosebumps just thinking about it!"
E_C2_Main_7_47,"That would lead to a disaster!"
E_C2_Main_8_1,"Now that we've had two battles already, how about we take a break for a while?"
E_C2_Main_8_2,"We can sit around and rest since we're indoors."
E_C2_Main_8_3,"I'm all about resting, but this building is not warm enough."
E_C2_Main_8_4,"Cold air is seeping through the windows."
E_C2_Main_8_5,"I believe this outfit was enchanted to be weatherproof..."
E_C2_Main_8_6,"Brrr, it's cold. Sonia, do you have handwarmers?"
E_C2_Main_8_7,"Don't you still have a few left from last time?"
E_C2_Main_8_8,"Yeah, one second. Where did I put...?"
E_C2_Main_8_9,"Um? What's a handwarmer?"
E_C2_Main_8_10,"Oh, it's this magical device I invented when I was in Grandpa Ricardo's orphanage."
E_C2_Main_8_11,"It's nothing special. I put a metal plate engraved with a spell into a stone. It continuously lets out a weak electric current. That's all."
E_C2_Main_8_12,"That heats up the metal plate without melting it, and the stone becomes warm as well."
E_C2_Main_8_13,"It helps you keep warm if you put the stone in your clothes or hold it in your hands."
E_C2_Main_8_14,"But… the heat doesn't last long, so I need to open the stone and recharge its power every once in a while."
E_C2_Main_8_15,"Ah.. how creative!"
E_C2_Main_8_16,"I think I can make something similar with my blessing..."
E_C2_Main_8_17,"It would be a godsend for those working outside during cold winter days."
E_C2_Main_8_18,"And... Oh? Wait, did you say Ricardo?"
E_C2_Main_8_19,"Eh? Do you know our Grandpa?"
E_C2_Main_8_20,"Of course! I was one of the Holy Knights under Sir Ricardo a few years back."
E_C2_Main_8_21,"Then, when I was chosen by the Stigmata from Goddess Lua,"
E_C2_Main_8_22,"I had to leave his command to be the Saint."
E_C2_Main_8_23,"Wow, you were Grandpa's knight!"
E_C2_Main_8_24,"You must have seen our Grandpa do great things!"
E_C2_Main_8_25,"Hahaha, of course."
E_C2_Main_8_26,"Even in my vast layer of memories, it's difficult to find anyone else as great as him."
E_C2_Main_8_27,"Huh? Who cares? He's just a human!"
E_C2_Main_8_28,"But... I'd like to see that hand-warming thing, though."
E_C2_Main_8_29,"Show it to me now."
E_C2_Main_8_30,"Stop being condescending and just tell them that you're cold!"
E_C2_Main_8_31,"Darn, you brat!"
E_C2_Main_8_32,"Umm?"
E_C2_Main_8_33,"Another barrier?"
E_C2_Main_8_34,"Oh, we were startled to see a building in a place like this."
E_C2_Main_8_35,"We didn't know there were people that came before us."
E_C2_Main_8_36,"Tee hee, what unusual individuals do we have here?"
E_C2_Main_8_37,"Two from the great Dragon family,"
E_C2_Main_8_38,"the Saint of Blessings chosen by Lua,"
E_C2_Main_8_39,"and the Blue Hurricane and her assistant..."
E_C2_Main_8_40,"I don't know who you are,"
E_C2_Main_8_41,"but I really hate it when someone calls me that. Please stop calling me that."
E_C2_Main_8_42,"Oops, excuse me... How should I address you then?"
E_C2_Main_8_43,"...Ms. Homunculus with the power of lightning, or..."
E_C2_Main_8_44,"…!!"
E_C2_Main_8_45,"How did you know?"
E_C2_Main_8_46,"Hohoho, don't look at me like that."
E_C2_Main_8_47,"You can say that it's my job to... know stuff."
E_C2_Main_8_48,"Psh.."
E_C2_Main_8_49,"*Giggle* Don't worry."
E_C2_Main_8_50,"I don't make it a habit to reveal other people's secrets so frivolously."
E_C2_Main_8_51,"I came to Orvel to buy some potions and reagents from Mediana,"
E_C2_Main_8_52,"and heard about the legendary tree. That's why we're here."
E_C2_Main_8_53,"Well.. we didn't expect to be stuck in a barrier like this though.."
E_C2_Main_8_54,"*Giggle* I wanted to take the sap of the legendary tree and see what I could make of it,"
E_C2_Main_8_55,"but things turned out like this."
E_C2_Main_8_56,"By the way, dragons..."
E_C2_Main_8_57,"Would you mind having your blood taken? A small amount?"
E_C2_Main_8_58,"I really need it for the research I'm currently working on!"
E_C2_Main_8_59,"…!!"
E_C2_Main_8_60,"Then... I'll take silence as a yes."
E_C2_Main_8_61,"Don't worry! I have this needle made of dragon bone that Yanne gave me. You won't feel a thing!"
E_C2_Main_8_62,"Kyaaaa, what is wrong with this human!?"
E_C2_Main_8_63,"Dragon Slayer Weapon! Go away! Get lost!"
E_C2_Main_8_64,"Ehhhhh, what is that!? That huge needle is made of dragon bone!"
E_C2_Main_8_65,"Laias! A human is trying to eat me!"
E_C2_Main_8_66,"Fufufu.. It won't hurt. Just a little sting…"
E_C2_Main_8_67,"Kyaaaak!"
E_C2_Main_9_1,"Ah, what a shame."
E_C2_Main_9_2,"This is a bit less than I was hoping to get..."
E_C2_Main_9_3,"But alright, it is what it is."
E_C2_Main_9_4,"*Giggle* People don't know much about dragon's blood."
E_C2_Main_9_5,"Please share if you find anything from your research!"
E_C2_Main_9_6,"Sure, if it's for the development of medical science, I'll gladly share it."
E_C2_Main_9_7,"So, I have collected some dragon blood, and even tested a health drink..."
E_C2_Main_9_8,"As always, thank you! Fufu.."
E_C2_Main_9_9,"Ewww... Needle! Needle!"
E_C2_Main_9_10,"Aw, my head... That woman is crazy... She's a threat to all dragons..."
E_C2_Main_9_11,"...Umm, the dragons in the storybooks were scary..."
E_C2_Main_9_12,"I guess they're different in reality, Sonia!"
E_C2_Main_9_13,"Well, that's... Given the circumstances... Consider this a special case..."
E_C2_Main_9_14,"Ahahaha....."
E_C2_Main_9_15,"...This might be a traumatic event for the two of them, don't you think?"
E_C2_Main_10_1,"Ewww, that sucked so bad! We should have left the building right after the battle!"
E_C2_Main_10_2,"That female human with the needle! I'll break her in half if I see her again!"
E_C2_Main_10_3,"Hahaha, calm down, Neraxis. It's just a small amount of blood."
E_C2_Main_10_4,"Patience is a virtue that you seem to be lacking, Neraxis."
E_C2_Main_10_5,"Don't you dare judge us dragon, Human."
E_C2_Main_10_6,"If it weren't for Laias, these two hands would have ki-"
E_C2_Main_10_7,"Hahaha, I'm sorry to hear that."
E_C2_Main_10_8,"Unlike someone, Lilia there has already wiped away her tears and started behaving like an adult."
E_C2_Main_10_9,"Well, as they say, Lilia is a more mature, well-behaved dragon, I suppose."
E_C2_Main_10_10,"Urgh...!"
E_C2_Main_10_11,"...Hmph!"
E_C2_Main_10_12,"Ahahaha... He's playing with the dragons like they're some regular kids."
E_C2_Main_10_13,"The world would be surprised to see what the Saint can actually do..."
E_C2_Main_10_14,"Um? Did you hear that?"
E_C2_Main_10_15,"...Wind? Leaves shaking?"
E_C2_Main_10_16,"Long time, no see, Saint of Blessings."
E_C2_Main_10_17,"Greetings, Grand Elidoran Sage."
E_C2_Main_10_18,"You are in the company with Her Highness, Princess Selene."
E_C2_Main_10_19,"It's been a while, Lucias."
E_C2_Main_10_20,"You are not with Brother Baudouin today."
E_C2_Main_10_21,"Hmph, an Elf."
E_C2_Main_10_22,"I've seen Dark Elves often, but it's my first time seeing an Elidoran Elf."
E_C2_Main_10_23,"I'm Selene, princess of Elidora."
E_C2_Main_10_24,"Greetings to the great tuners of nature, the ancient beings."
E_C2_Main_10_25,"I'm Lorraine, a Druid."
E_C2_Main_10_26,"Greetings to the great tuners of nature, the ancient beings."
E_C2_Main_10_27,"Raise your heads, Elves."
E_C2_Main_10_28,"I'm still a young and immature dragon."
E_C2_Main_10_29,"I don't feel comfortable being praised like that."
E_C2_Main_10_30,"...Hmph."
E_C2_Main_10_31,"By the way, what brings the Elidoran elves to Orvel?"
E_C2_Main_10_32,"Oh, nothing special, actually."
E_C2_Main_10_33,"My sister, Dosarta, is responsible for guarding the Tower of Challenge."
E_C2_Main_10_34,"She recently heard about a special festival called Christmas from a human visitor."
E_C2_Main_10_35,"She seemed awfully bored these days."
E_C2_Main_10_36,"So, I wanted to experience Christmas, tell her about it and bring her some souvenirs."
E_C2_Main_10_37,"I came here looking to learn about the legendary tree born from Rudolph's blood."
E_C2_Main_10_38,"I've been busy for the past 100 years, but I was able to spare some time this year."
E_C2_Main_10_39,"But… look where we ended up.. hahaha.."
E_C2_Main_10_40,"...In fact, we could have lost intentionally and escaped this place..."
E_C2_Main_10_41,"But then I sensed some energy of our kind, so we decided to stay."
E_C2_Main_10_42,"Huh? Ah? Me?"
E_C2_Main_10_43,"Didn't we play volleyball together at the beach in the Summer Festival?"
E_C2_Main_10_44,"...What is your name?"
E_C2_Main_10_45,"My name? Oh, I am Mirianne..."
E_C2_Main_10_46,"The light of your soul tells me... You are a Half Elf, about 12 years old."
E_C2_Main_10_47,"The reason for your rapid growth was... a trauma to your soul."
E_C2_Main_10_48,"Eh? I'm not following what you're saying... Um..."
E_C2_Main_10_49,"Give me your hand."
E_C2_Main_10_50,"We'll talk about it later."
E_C2_Main_10_51,"Hey!"
E_C2_Main_10_52,"I'm not sure what you're up to,"
E_C2_Main_10_53,"but Mirianne is feeling flustered. Will you give her some space?"
E_C2_Main_10_54,"This doesn't concern you, Homunculus."
E_C2_Main_10_55,"...! How did you…?"
E_C2_Main_10_56,"...No, that's not the point!"
E_C2_Main_10_57,"Not concern me? Nonsense!"
E_C2_Main_10_58,"Get your hands off my family!"
E_C2_Main_11_1,"*Pant, pant* That was... a thrilling experience of lightning magic."
E_C2_Main_11_2,"...Hmm, this energy is..."
E_C2_Main_11_3,"We have not heard your name yet."
E_C2_Main_11_4,"...Sonia. No surname."
E_C2_Main_11_5,"Then, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_11_6,"Are you aware of the power that you have?"
E_C2_Main_11_7,"...Core of the Divine Beast, Vikal."
E_C2_Main_11_8,"I just know the name, not the details."
E_C2_Main_11_9,"What about it?"
E_C2_Main_11_10,"There are words in ancient Elven literature."
E_C2_Main_11_11,"There was a time, more than ten million years ago,"
E_C2_Main_11_12,"when the ancient species ruled over the world and the lands were covered with Mana energy."
E_C2_Main_11_13,"Civilizations were still immature, and small creatures like humans and Elves were not able to handle magic and elements."
E_C2_Main_11_14,"Those who realized the secrets of the world acquired the power of truth that equaled the abilities of a god."
E_C2_Main_11_15,"They were called 'Transcendants' and the creatures that they made became known as 'Divine Beasts.'"
E_C2_Main_11_16,"And among the Transcendants was one that could control thunder and lightning."
E_C2_Main_11_17,"His power was so strong that he created two Divine Beasts,"
E_C2_Main_11_18,"one of which was Vikal, and the other was Legios."
E_C2_Main_11_19,"After he disappeared, the beasts were set free..."
E_C2_Main_11_20,"The two Divine Beasts took different paths, and embarked on a journey to find their master."
E_C2_Main_11_21,"No one knows what happened afterward..."
E_C2_Main_11_22,"but somehow, Vikal seems to have ended up being your heart."
E_C2_Main_11_23,"…"
E_C2_Main_11_24,"If what you're saying is true..."
E_C2_Main_11_25,"Was it the power of the Divine Beast that awakened my will?"
E_C2_Main_11_26,"I know it's rare for a Homunculus to have an ego."
E_C2_Main_11_27,"That's beyond my knowledge."
E_C2_Main_11_28,"Homunculus creation magic was the invention of a human wizard."
E_C2_Main_11_29,"There is a fundamental difference between the magic of humans and Elves, so I can't be sure."
E_C2_Main_11_30,"But it is hard to say that they are not related."
E_C2_Main_11_31,"…"
E_C2_Main_11_32,"Sonia..."
E_C2_Main_11_33,"Umm, the barrier has been removed. We should be leaving soon."
E_C2_Main_11_34,"There's no time. Please excuse me for a second."
E_C2_Main_11_35,"Don't worry, I don't intend to hurt you..."
E_C2_Main_11_36,"Umm? Eh? What is this...?"
E_C2_Main_11_37,"The rapid growth of Half Elves is the result from the collision of human and Elf life force."
E_C2_Main_11_38,"You are not the first, and certainly not the last to suffer from it."
E_C2_Main_11_39,"But according to what I saw a minute earlier..."
E_C2_Main_11_40,"Your case seems to be a very unstable one."
E_C2_Main_11_41,"Do you have any memories before your rapid growth?"
E_C2_Main_11_42,"...No. I don't remember anything at all…"
E_C2_Main_11_43,"I believe that memory was what triggered your growth."
E_C2_Main_11_44,"Rapid growth occurs to normal Half Elves around the age of fifteen."
E_C2_Main_11_45,"But you seem to have grown into what you are now even before you turned ten."
E_C2_Main_11_46,"As if running away from something, sealing your memory."
E_C2_Main_11_47,"...And after the growth, no one treated you as a child."
E_C2_Main_11_48,"Being both human and Elf.. you must have gone through a tough childhood. What a pity."
E_C2_Main_11_49,"…"
E_C2_Main_11_50,"But it doesn't end there."
E_C2_Main_11_51,"The sealed memory of yours... That remains in you as an anxiety and a negative energy gnawing upon your soul."
E_C2_Main_11_52,"Do you not feel anxious all of a sudden in the middle of the night or when left alone?"
E_C2_Main_11_53,"…"
E_C2_Main_11_54,"You will have scars on your soul until you get to the bottom of your anxiety."
E_C2_Main_11_55,"But the progress seems slow, probably because of the good environment you've been in. Friends, family..."
E_C2_Main_11_56,"But it is like a ticking time bomb. It is the trauma that will burst when you least expect it."
E_C2_Main_11_57,"Bear that in mind."
E_C2_Main_11_58,"Unless you prepare to discover your true self,"
E_C2_Main_11_59,"the day will come when your soul will be ruined forever."
E_C2_Main_11_60,"...Then, I think my time here is up. This is all I can do for you right now."
E_C2_Main_11_61,"Shall we, Your Highness?"
E_C2_Main_11_62,"*Sigh* I guess I should find gifts for Dosarta somewhere else."
E_C2_Main_11_63,"Then, Mirianne. Until next time."
E_C2_Main_11_64,"I'm afraid this is all we can give you today,"
E_C2_Main_11_65,"but please, visit Elidora anytime."
E_C2_Main_11_66,"Then, we could speak more at length."
E_C2_Main_11_67,"If we can be of help, we would like to be."
E_C2_Main_11_68,"Though your nature is complex, you are still one of the children of the Elven family."
E_C2_Main_11_69,"…"
E_C2_Main_11_70,"I... Umm..."
E_C2_Main_11_71,"Huh...? That's it?"
E_C2_Main_11_72,"Come on! That wasn't even a proper fight!"
E_C2_Main_11_73,"I didn't even get to do anything! I wanted to take all the credit for bringing the Christmas tree back!"
E_C2_Main_11_74,"*Sigh* That knucklehead never knows when to stop."
E_C2_Main_11_75,"We're a team, and you can't take all the credit for yourself."
E_C2_Main_11_76,"*Sigh* I have to say, Neraxis. I am disappointed."
E_C2_Main_11_77,"You'll be a burden to Laias like this."
E_C2_Main_11_78,"Wh-what!?"
E_C2_Main_11_79,"What did I do!?"
E_C2_Main_11_80,"...Hmp."
E_C2_Main_11_81,"...Ehehheh."
E_C2_Main_11_82,"...Wh-what! Why are you laughing!?"
E_C2_Main_11_83,"Seriously! What!?"
E_C2_Main_12_1,"...Hmm, somehow, Neraxis's slow-wittedness relieved the tension in the air,"
E_C2_Main_12_2,"but still, it's boring to wander without knowing the destination."
E_C2_Main_12_3,"Neraxis, is it possible that you might have another joke for us to relax and laugh?"
E_C2_Main_12_4,"Leave me alone, damn it! I ain't your clown!"
E_C2_Main_12_5,"Oh hell, I would totally blow you little bugs up and go back to the desert,"
E_C2_Main_12_6,"if only I had the chance!"
E_C2_Main_12_7,"I bet you wouldn't."
E_C2_Main_12_8,"Can you imagine what Laias is going to say if you do that?"
E_C2_Main_12_9,"...Hmph. I know that."
E_C2_Main_12_10,"*Grumble grumble*"
E_C2_Main_12_11,"*Sigh* How childish.."
E_C2_Main_12_12,"By the way, how far do you think we'd have to go?"
E_C2_Main_12_13,"Well, I'm not sure."
E_C2_Main_12_14,"We have no choice but to keep fighting."
E_C2_Main_12_15,"We can just lose if getting out is our first priority,"
E_C2_Main_12_16,"but I don't think Neraxis will allow that to happen.. Hahaha…"
E_C2_Main_12_17,"Well, I feel the same way. I want to get the tree for Laias,"
E_C2_Main_12_18,"and want it to be the most special tree in the world."
E_C2_Main_12_19,"I'm sure he feels that way too…"
E_C2_Main_12_20,"Argh, He's such a troublesome guy!"
E_C2_Main_12_21,"Waaaah!"
E_C2_Main_12_22,"?!"
E_C2_Main_12_23,"Ouch, you knucklehead! What did you do now!?"
E_C2_Main_12_24,"You, Keuuuu, you did -"
E_C2_Main_12_25,"...Uh oh?"
E_C2_Main_12_26,"What did I do?"
E_C2_Main_12_27,"Oh, look who it is. Greetings to you, Yanne. We haven't met since you came back from Dragia with my sister."
E_C2_Main_12_28,"Oh, Lilia."
E_C2_Main_12_29,"Great to see you. Do something about Neraxis, please!"
E_C2_Main_12_30,"He keeps growling like that... Did anything happen while I was not around?"
E_C2_Main_12_31,"I was just at the campsite north of Orvel"
E_C2_Main_12_32,"having a party with my friends who played Rudolph last year.."
E_C2_Main_12_33,"And suddenly, the tree made a sound, and Rephy and I were dragged to this weird place!"
E_C2_Main_12_34,"Rephy, say something!"
E_C2_Main_12_35,"Zzzzzz..."
E_C2_Main_12_36,"Gosh, of course he falls asleep again after eating too much of grilled garlic and vegetables earlier."
E_C2_Main_12_37,"…"
E_C2_Main_12_38,"Yanne, do you by any chance know a woman called Mediana?"
E_C2_Main_12_39,"Eh?"
E_C2_Main_12_40,"...Did Mediana do something?"
E_C2_Main_12_41,"Krrrr-"
E_C2_Main_12_42,"Heeeeek!"
E_C2_Main_12_43,"At least tell me the reason why you're mad!"
E_C2_Main_12_44,"Somebody could get hurt!"
E_C2_Main_12_45,"Zzzzzz... Eh? What's happening?"
E_C2_Main_12_46,"Healing? Do you want me to summon the souls and heal you?"
E_C2_Main_12_47,"Or should I blaze up some fire and stuff?"
E_C2_Main_12_48,"Just leave it all to me. A-hem!"
E_C2_Main_12_49,"No, wait! Stop it, people! This is so chaotic!"
E_C2_Main_12_50,"Mmm, Popcorn is always the way to go while watching stuff."
E_C2_Main_12_51,"I cannot agree with you more.. hehehe.."
E_C2_Main_12_52,"…"
E_C2_Main_13_1,"Ummm, now I know what's going on."
E_C2_Main_13_2,"In short, the thing that I gave Mediana became a needle, right...?"
E_C2_Main_13_3,"And she used it to sample your blood..."
E_C2_Main_13_4,"*Hiss*"
E_C2_Main_13_5,"Hahaha, this is awkward."
E_C2_Main_13_6,"Well, Mediana couldn't have done it with bad intentions."
E_C2_Main_13_7,"She is kind of a weirdo... but she's not a bad person."
E_C2_Main_13_8,"I believe she needed dragon blood for her research on curing the dragons that went insane after Demon War."
E_C2_Main_13_9,"And that's why I gave her the leftovers of Svelta's bone."
E_C2_Main_13_10,"…?"
E_C2_Main_13_11,"Curing the Mad Dragons...?"
E_C2_Main_13_12,"Even magic couldn't cure their madness..."
E_C2_Main_13_13,"Oh, Mediana's approach is somewhat different."
E_C2_Main_13_14,"It's medical science, the material or physical means of remedy that does not depend on magic..."
E_C2_Main_13_15,"I'm not too sure how I should explain this.. hahaha."
E_C2_Main_13_16,"Anyway, Mediana, Phillop, and I are working together on it."
E_C2_Main_13_17,"Our main goal at hand is to restore Temeraire from madness."
E_C2_Main_13_18,"Although various experiments are still underway, Mediana told me that she needed blood samples of dragons other than those of Red Dragons."
E_C2_Main_13_19,"...Bringing that Temeraire back to normal?"
E_C2_Main_13_20,"Then... maybe Armarta could also be…"
E_C2_Main_13_21,"(Eek, darn it. I've taken a few things from Armarta's repositorium...)"
E_C2_Main_13_22,"That's just our goal, but wouldn't it be nice if we can make it happen someday?"
E_C2_Main_13_23,"I believe her coming here has something to with her ongoing research."
E_C2_Main_13_24,"Now that you mention it, she did mention her research when we encountered her."
E_C2_Main_13_25,"She didn't mention what the research was about, though."
E_C2_Main_13_26,"Hahaha, that's classic Mediana. She doesn't care about other things when she's focused on one thing."
E_C2_Main_13_27,"It's like her tenacity is blocking everything else from her sight."
E_C2_Main_13_28,"Hahaha... I think I know what you mean."
E_C2_Main_13_29,"I heard there was a commotion about a health drink around Mediana's Tent this summer."
E_C2_Main_13_30,"Hehehe, the Summer Festival was so much fun."
E_C2_Main_13_31,"I really enjoyed playing volleyball at the beach!"
E_C2_Main_13_32,"*Sniff, sniff*"
E_C2_Main_13_33,"This… this smells like home…"
E_C2_Main_13_34,"Um? What is it, Rephy?"
E_C2_Main_13_35,"Uh? N-nothing."
E_C2_Main_13_36,"It just smelled like home... I mean, Elidora!"
E_C2_Main_13_37,"Home…is…for..sleeping…"
E_C2_Main_13_38,"Zzzzzz… Uncle Oddy... Where do you want to travel this time...?"
E_C2_Main_13_39,"*Sigh* That one might be a little too laid back. Hahaha."
E_C2_Main_13_40,"Well, I think our time is almost up."
E_C2_Main_13_41,"The tree is trying to kick us out..."
E_C2_Main_13_42,"Hahaha, I should get back to my party."
E_C2_Main_13_43,"Well, bye bye!"
E_C2_Main_13_44,"Neraxis, Lilia... Say hi to Laias for me, please!"
E_C2_Main_13_45,"…"
E_C2_Main_13_46,"...Phew. Hey, knucklehead. You did something wrong again, didn't you?"
E_C2_Main_13_47,"N-no, I didn't!"
E_C2_Main_13_48,"...Hahahaha."
E_C2_Main_14_1,"U-um... It's gotten pretty dark, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_14_2,"A demiplane created by a Christmas tree has weather and time?"
E_C2_Main_14_3,"What an astonishing place this is."
E_C2_Main_14_4,"...Or maybe, this meaningless fighting is about to end."
E_C2_Main_14_5,"The legendary tree.. It's as magnificent as they say."
E_C2_Main_14_6,"By the way, I heard the tree grants our wishes... Well, nothing comes to mind, at least for now."
E_C2_Main_14_7,"Delicious snacks and pretty clothes... We can just go buy all these things at Orvel."
E_C2_Main_14_8,"Well, none of us exactly came here bearing a desperate wish, to start with."
E_C2_Main_14_9,"Dragons came here to get a Christmas Tree,"
E_C2_Main_14_10,"and that unfathomable priest doesn't seem to have earthly desires at all."
E_C2_Main_14_11,"Mirianne and I were just looking to examine the tree."
E_C2_Main_14_12,"But... after we met Lorraine and Selene, I might have one in mind..."
E_C2_Main_14_13,"Oh, I think I know! You want a lead on the life magic of Homunculus, don't you?"
E_C2_Main_14_14,"Or is it information about Vikal that you mentioned earlier?"
E_C2_Main_14_15,"Well, either of them could work as a wish,"
E_C2_Main_14_16,"but I don't think they're our first priority."
E_C2_Main_14_17,"???"
E_C2_Main_14_18,"Well, I didn't hear all the details about it from Grandpa,"
E_C2_Main_14_19,"but I have other questions I want answers to."
E_C2_Main_14_20,"You... You're only twelve. You can act more like a child, and do whatever you like."
E_C2_Main_14_21,"But... you are so mature and dedicated. You just work hard for others without caring about yourself."
E_C2_Main_14_22,"...Are you really happy with your life?"
E_C2_Main_14_23,"Are you really okay like this?"
E_C2_Main_14_24,"I... I am not okay."
E_C2_Main_14_25,"…"
E_C2_Main_14_26,"I have been thinking about it after hearing what Lorraine said."
E_C2_Main_14_27,"I thought I had forgotten about it since it was a long time ago when we first started to travel together."
E_C2_Main_14_28,"You know, I'm a Homunculus, so I don't sleep."
E_C2_Main_14_29,"Yes, I know you don't need to sleep or eat, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_14_30,"Your body heals itself as long as you breathe."
E_C2_Main_14_31,"But you don't."
E_C2_Main_14_32,"Your body is not artificially made. You were born in this world with a soul and life."
E_C2_Main_14_33,"Unlike me, you become tired and sleepy."
E_C2_Main_14_34,"...Every night, I watched you sleep."
E_C2_Main_14_35,"You were quivering, as if having a nightmare."
E_C2_Main_14_36,"But the next day, you were all smiles."
E_C2_Main_14_37,"As if there was nothing wrong going on."
E_C2_Main_14_38,"...That is…"
E_C2_Main_14_39,"You are my only friend, assistant, and the only family I have except Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_14_40,"I like the other kids in the orphanage... Kasel, Frey, and Clause…"
E_C2_Main_14_41,"I like them all, but Grandpa and you are special to me."
E_C2_Main_14_42,"I want to help you."
E_C2_Main_14_43,"And I want to support you."
E_C2_Main_14_44,"All I know is how to fight,"
E_C2_Main_14_45,"but if there's anything I can do, I want to do it for you."
E_C2_Main_14_46,"Sonia..."
E_C2_Main_14_47,"…"
E_C2_Main_14_48,"...Thank you."
E_C2_Main_14_49,"...Hmph. This is awkward..!"
E_C2_Main_14_50,"Ah, we should get ourselves out of here first."
E_C2_Main_14_51,"We've fallen behind while talking. Let's hurry and catch up."
E_C2_Main_14_52,"...Okay!"
E_C2_Main_15_1,"That boring barrier again."
E_C2_Main_15_2,"So, who's next!?"
E_C2_Main_15_3,"Bring it on! Hurry up!"
E_C2_Main_15_4,"…"
E_C2_Main_15_5,"Oh? They look quite strong!"
E_C2_Main_15_6,"Alright! Time to battle!"
E_C2_Main_15_7,"Come on!"
E_C2_Main_15_8,"Wait, Neraxis."
E_C2_Main_15_9,"Argh!"
E_C2_Main_15_10,"Wh-what is it?"
E_C2_Main_15_11,"Oh, it's just that..."
E_C2_Main_15_12,"I happen to know both of them…"
E_C2_Main_15_13,"Lucias? Hahahaha, long time no see!"
E_C2_Main_15_14,"It's tough to see you after you've become the Saint."
E_C2_Main_15_15,"It's been a long time, Sir. It's good to see you as well."
E_C2_Main_15_16,"I've been traveling all around Orbis. Hahaha."
E_C2_Main_15_17,"I'm sorry I couldn't visit you more often."
E_C2_Main_15_18,"You're right, being well is a good thing! My well-being is preventing me from retirement though!! Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_15_19,"But recently, I've been doing a lot more paperwork at Orvel"
E_C2_Main_15_20,"rather than going on expeditionary missions."
E_C2_Main_15_21,"It could be better, but at least I'm doing a good thing! Kehahaha!!"
E_C2_Main_15_22,"Hm hm, you haven't changed a bit."
E_C2_Main_15_23,"You are still Sir Ricardo, just as I remember you."
E_C2_Main_15_24,"And your company... He's Kaulah."
E_C2_Main_15_25,"You were a great help a few months ago, Saint of Blessings."
E_C2_Main_15_26,"Without your blessing and healing,"
E_C2_Main_15_27,"my brothers and sisters would still be struggling"
E_C2_Main_15_28,"to overcome the demonic infection and its aftereffects."
E_C2_Main_15_29,"Did that demon Viska visit you afterward?"
E_C2_Main_15_30,"You told me that she played a key role in thwarting Malduk's assault and minimizing the damage."
E_C2_Main_15_31,"That's right, but I didn't see her yet afterward."
E_C2_Main_15_32,"But why do you ask about her?"
E_C2_Main_15_33,"Hmm, it still bothers me."
E_C2_Main_15_34,"A demon dwelling in the body of a young girl."
E_C2_Main_15_35,"I worry that there may be more demons residing among us without revealing themselves."
E_C2_Main_15_36,"I have seen a similar case when I traveled with Brother Baudouin, but... Hmm..."
E_C2_Main_15_37,"Hmm, I don't think we need to worry about Viska."
E_C2_Main_15_38,"However, we can't assume other demons are going to be the same case as hers."
E_C2_Main_15_39,"We can never be too careful."
E_C2_Main_15_40,"By the way, Lucias, you have a couple of surprising companions."
E_C2_Main_15_41,"Hahaha! It's been a long time, Sonia! Mirianne!"
E_C2_Main_15_42,"You look great! Good to see you."
E_C2_Main_15_43,"…"
E_C2_Main_15_44,"Hehehe, Grandpa! Long time no see!"
E_C2_Main_15_45,"How have you been? Have you been eating well?"
E_C2_Main_15_46,"You know you can't just eat meat all the time, don't you?"
E_C2_Main_15_47,"You're eating a fair amount of vegetables as well, aren't you?"
E_C2_Main_15_48,"Haha, hahaha... Sure, of course! Grandpa is not a picky eater!"
E_C2_Main_15_49,"*Clears throat* You are here to investigate the legendary tree, aren't you?"
E_C2_Main_15_50,"Mhm, pretty much."
E_C2_Main_15_51,"Did the Church send you to investigate it, too?"
E_C2_Main_15_52,"Kehahaha! I'm afraid that wasn't the case."
E_C2_Main_15_53,"The Church heard that the Guild had already taken care of it, so they decided not to do anything."
E_C2_Main_15_54,"I had no idea that you were the ones they sent though! Hahaha."
E_C2_Main_15_55,"To tell you the truth, I was so busy that I couldn't get a proper Christmas tree this year. What a shame."
E_C2_Main_15_56,"So I wanted to present the kids in the orphanage the best tree ever in the world..."
E_C2_Main_15_57,"Then, I met an acquaintance named Kaulah, who came to Orvel to get souvenirs for young Orcs,"
E_C2_Main_15_58,"so I got some help to find the legendary tree."
E_C2_Main_15_59,"But we ended up getting trapped in here. Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_15_60,"Umm, I see..."
E_C2_Main_15_61,"But Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_15_62,"Hmm? What is it?"
E_C2_Main_15_63,"I have something to ask you."
E_C2_Main_15_64,"...It's about Mirianne's memories."
E_C2_Main_15_65,"…"
E_C2_Main_15_66,"You just told me that Mirianne lost her memories, but not how that happened."
E_C2_Main_15_67,"But we just met Lorraine, the sage of Elidora Forest."
E_C2_Main_15_68,"And she told us..."
E_C2_Main_15_69,"about... Mirianne's current condition."
E_C2_Main_15_70,"...So, you've finally figured it out."
E_C2_Main_15_71,"But... I'm sorry. What I know might not be enough to answer all of your questions."
E_C2_Main_15_72,"I only know what Mirianne was like just before I took her home..."
E_C2_Main_15_73,"Anything before that, I do not know."
E_C2_Main_15_74,"Just tell me everything you know."
E_C2_Main_15_75,"For me... and for Mirianne. We really need this."
E_C2_Main_15_76,"…"
E_C2_Main_15_77,"In the past, I made a vow."
E_C2_Main_15_78,"Children I've taken in... my children... I vowed that I will keep them safe, no matter what."
E_C2_Main_15_79,"This information might hurt Mirianne."
E_C2_Main_15_80,"So I wasn't going to tell her for the rest of my life."
E_C2_Main_15_81,"But we must know what happened in order to make a progress."
E_C2_Main_15_82,"If not, Mirianne won't have any courage to move forward."
E_C2_Main_15_83,"Her soul cannot be complete without knowing her past."
E_C2_Main_15_84,"…"
E_C2_Main_15_85,"...Grandpa, please."
E_C2_Main_15_86,"Mirianne..."
E_C2_Main_15_87,"I want to know."
E_C2_Main_15_88,"My past... the forgotten memories."
E_C2_Main_15_89,"I need to know them to start over again."
E_C2_Main_15_90,"I'll embrace all of my pain and agony…"
E_C2_Main_15_91,"I'm scared and anxious..."
E_C2_Main_15_92,"But I can't stay like this. I need to move forward."
E_C2_Main_15_93,"…"
E_C2_Main_15_94,"If that's what you want... I have no other choice."
E_C2_Main_15_95,"But I'm afraid I can't tell you just like that."
E_C2_Main_15_96,"Grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_15_97,"For the first time in years, it's sparring time with Grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_15_98,"Sonia, Mirianne! Get yourselves ready."
E_C2_Main_15_99,"If you can defeat me..."
E_C2_Main_15_100,"If you can prove how much you have grown,"
E_C2_Main_15_101,"I will tell you all about it."
E_C2_Main_15_102,"...Watch out, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_15_103,"I've gotten a lot stronger."
E_C2_Main_15_104,"...I will not lose!"
E_C2_Main_15_105,"I, too, worked hard to be strong like Sonia!"
E_C2_Main_15_106,"...Hahahaha."
E_C2_Main_15_107,"You make me proud, my children."
E_C2_Main_15_108,"...Well, come on!"
E_C2_Main_15_109,"Woooo!"
E_C2_Main_16_1,"Whew."
E_C2_Main_16_2,"Both of you have grown stronger."
E_C2_Main_16_3,"This is my first defeat in my life."
E_C2_Main_16_4,"Hahaha, maybe Grandpa is getting old now."
E_C2_Main_16_5,"...I know you let us win."
E_C2_Main_16_6,"You never swung your pillar with full strength, not once."
E_C2_Main_16_7,"She's right, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_16_8,"It was so obvious that you went easy on us."
E_C2_Main_16_9,"...Kehahaha! I guess you've become skilled enough to notice that..!"
E_C2_Main_16_10,"Well, what choice did I have? I don't want my granddaughters hurt."
E_C2_Main_16_11,"It was enough for me to see your determination."
E_C2_Main_16_12,"Kaulah, thank you for helping me."
E_C2_Main_16_13,"Hahaha, no worries. It was nothing compared to what you've done for the Orcs."
E_C2_Main_16_14,"You were the one who sent the Holy Knights to settle the situation in Ogria."
E_C2_Main_16_15,"Thanks to you, the reconstruction of the Orc towns is well underway."
E_C2_Main_16_16,"Hahaha, it's good to hear that."
E_C2_Main_16_17,"I know we still have disputes between humans and Orcs,"
E_C2_Main_16_18,"but I believe they should not be passed down to the next generations."
E_C2_Main_16_19,"The number of knights I requested was a little too high, even for my standards, but I wanted to give as much help as I could..."
E_C2_Main_16_20,"But luckily, Great Priestess Iris agreed with my opinion."
E_C2_Main_16_21,"You know how they say, there's nothing like peace. Kehahaha!"
E_C2_Main_16_22,"So, what about Mirianne's story?"
E_C2_Main_16_23,"Ah, right. I'm sorry I went off on a tangent."
E_C2_Main_16_24,"...I will tell you everything that I know."
E_C2_Main_16_25,"But do bear in mind that there are some missing parts that I don't know about."
E_C2_Main_16_26,"You'll have to fill the rest yourselves."
E_C2_Main_16_27,"Yes, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_16_28,"Don't worry."
E_C2_Main_16_29,"I'm stronger now."
E_C2_Main_16_30,"...Yes, alright."
E_C2_Main_16_31,"...Then, I must begin with the Half Elves."
E_C2_Main_16_32,"After I've taken Mirianne in, I did some research on Half Elves."
E_C2_Main_16_33,"It's very rare for a human and an Elf to have a child together."
E_C2_Main_16_34,"Also, since an Elf's lifespan is a few hundred times longer than a human's, you'll almost never see the two races fall for each other."
E_C2_Main_16_35,"However, Elidoran Elves have many interactions with humans,"
E_C2_Main_16_36,"and there have been some cases where a human from Orvelia and an Elidoran Elf got together."
E_C2_Main_16_37,"But... Elves have a difficult time living in a human society, and vice versa."
E_C2_Main_16_38,"So even if a Half Elf is born from the couple…"
E_C2_Main_16_39,"Neither societies are suitable for the child to grow up in."
E_C2_Main_16_40,"...Hmm, I never knew that..."
E_C2_Main_16_41,"...Therefore, some decades ago, a few human-Half Elf couples agreed upon a common purpose and went off to find a place they could rebuild their lives."
E_C2_Main_16_42,"They made a town between Elidora Forest and King's Plains."
E_C2_Main_16_43,"That was... Mirianne's home."
E_C2_Main_16_44,"A town called... Ella."
E_C2_Main_16_45,"...Ella."
E_C2_Main_16_46,"…!"
E_C2_Main_16_47,"The town of Ella..."
E_C2_Main_16_48,"Mmm. Lucias, you would know it."
E_C2_Main_16_49,"You were in the Holy Knights, then."
E_C2_Main_16_50,"...6 years ago, the Holy Knights received a report."
E_C2_Main_16_51,"There was an indication of Darkness near Elidora Forest."
E_C2_Main_16_52,"So, the Holy Knights were patrolling around the boundary between King's Plains and Elidora Forest."
E_C2_Main_16_53,"And at some point, there was a thick, dark fog over the horizon."
E_C2_Main_16_54,"...I led the Holy Knights and headed down to the fog as fast as I could."
E_C2_Main_16_55,"...What we found was a terrible sight."
E_C2_Main_16_56,"The small town was burnt down to ashes."
E_C2_Main_16_57,"Elves, Human, Half Elves. All dead."
E_C2_Main_16_58,"I could see at a glimpse it was the Demons that did it, without a doubt."
E_C2_Main_16_59,"Violence without reason. Massacre. Killing for pleasure."
E_C2_Main_16_60,"...No one should experience that... ever."
E_C2_Main_16_61,"…"
E_C2_Main_16_62,"Sir Ricardo told us to recover the bodies scattered around the town."
E_C2_Main_16_63,"Bodies that became unrecognizable from excessive mutilation…."
E_C2_Main_16_64,"Even the ones in better condition were very painful to watch."
E_C2_Main_16_65,"But... while we were recovering bodies for cremation,"
E_C2_Main_16_66,"Lua showed us only one miracle that day."
E_C2_Main_16_67,"Beneath the bodies of an Elven woman and human man..."
E_C2_Main_16_68,"There was a little girl."
E_C2_Main_16_69,"She seemed shocked, and was quivering, but she was alive."
E_C2_Main_16_70,"That was you... Mirianne."
E_C2_Main_16_71,"…!"
E_C2_Main_16_72,"Your name was engraved on the pendant that you were wearing."
E_C2_Main_16_73,"A wooden pendant with a magical stone, handmade with a delicate touch..."
E_C2_Main_16_74,"That must have protected you from the fire and smoke, as we believed."
E_C2_Main_16_75,"But the moment we took you to safety, the pendant cracked and turned into dust."
E_C2_Main_16_76,"As if it had completed its role..."
E_C2_Main_16_77,"Mother... Father..."
E_C2_Main_16_78,"You were then so shocked by the horror…"
E_C2_Main_16_79,"When we asked you how old you were, you showed us fingers but couldn't speak at all."
E_C2_Main_16_80,"You were six. A six-year-old girl saw her parents burn to death right before her..."
E_C2_Main_16_81,"Rage, compassion, sadness... Emotions were swirling in my head."
E_C2_Main_16_82,"But above all things, I had one thing in my mind, and that was to protect you and keep you safe."
E_C2_Main_16_83,"Then... the rest is as you know."
E_C2_Main_16_84,"I brought Mirianne to the Orphanage, laid her in bed, and went to talk with the staff there."
E_C2_Main_16_85,"Then, I saw a great light exploding in Mirianne's room."
E_C2_Main_16_86,"I was surprised and ran up to your room."
E_C2_Main_16_87,"What I saw there was... you. All grown up, smiling at me with all your memories forgotten."
E_C2_Main_16_88,"...I was confused. What could have happened...?"
E_C2_Main_16_89,"But inwardly, I felt it might be better for you."
E_C2_Main_16_90,"The fact that you wouldn't need to carry that dark memory with you..."
E_C2_Main_16_91,"But you ended up finding the truth after all."
E_C2_Main_16_92,"That's..."
E_C2_Main_16_93,"…"
E_C2_Main_16_94,"Thank you, Grandpa."
E_C2_Main_16_95,"It must have been very hard for you to tell me these things..."
E_C2_Main_16_96,"...Are you okay, Mirianne?"
E_C2_Main_16_97,"I know this must be hard for you to take in."
E_C2_Main_16_98,"...To be completely honest, I'm not so sure."
E_C2_Main_16_99,"It doesn't feel like reality, maybe because I have no memories of it."
E_C2_Main_16_100,"Or maybe there is too much information for me to take in and handle.."
E_C2_Main_16_101,"But..."
E_C2_Main_16_102,"I want to visit there."
E_C2_Main_16_103,"Ella... The town where my parents rest..."
E_C2_Main_16_104,"Once I get there,"
E_C2_Main_16_105,"maybe I can figure something out."
E_C2_Main_16_106,"...Hahaha, you did become strong, Mirianne."
E_C2_Main_16_107,"You're only twelve, but you're very mature."
E_C2_Main_16_108,"I'm sorry... I wanted to let you have the happiest and most beautiful childhood,"
E_C2_Main_16_109,"but you grew up so fast, you ended up helping with errands at the orphanage in the end."
E_C2_Main_16_110,"I am so sorry..."
E_C2_Main_16_111,"...Heh heh, it's really fine, Grandpa. I helped because I wanted to."
E_C2_Main_16_112,"It was that orphanage that took me in and accepted me as a family."
E_C2_Main_16_113,"And... thanks to your story, I can now move a tiny step forward."
E_C2_Main_16_114,"I'm glad to hear that... really glad."
E_C2_Main_16_115,"...Umm, by the way, that might have been the last battle."
E_C2_Main_16_116,"Both the barrier and the demiplane are vanishing now."
E_C2_Main_16_117,"Hahaha. Is that so?"
E_C2_Main_16_118,"It's a shame that I don't get to take this tree, but well."
E_C2_Main_16_119,"I should find another tree to show our kids."
E_C2_Main_16_120,"Sonia, Mirianne! Come visit your brothers and sisters if you have time."
E_C2_Main_16_121,"The orphanage is always open."
E_C2_Main_16_122,"...Yes, Grandpa!"
E_C2_Main_16_123,"...Heh, stay well. I'll bring a lot of gifts!"
E_C2_Main_17_1,"Congratulations, Warriors of Christmas."
E_C2_Main_17_2,"In return, you shall have one wish granted."
E_C2_Main_17_3,"Consider and decide."
E_C2_Main_17_4,"…"
E_C2_Main_17_5,"Hey?"
E_C2_Main_17_6,"Are you listening?"
E_C2_Main_17_7,"Hey!"
E_C2_Main_17_8,"…"
E_C2_Main_17_9,"Umm, Neraxis?"
E_C2_Main_17_10,"Why are you so quiet?"
E_C2_Main_17_11,"...Shut up! Don't bother!"
E_C2_Main_17_12,"...Hmph, I shouldn't be feeling like this over some half-bloods."
E_C2_Main_17_13,"Darn it, I don't need anything!"
E_C2_Main_17_14,"Just take it all away! Wishes or whatnot!"
E_C2_Main_17_15,"Oh, this is something unexpected..."
E_C2_Main_17_16,"What on earth is going on?"
E_C2_Main_17_17,"Neraxis, since when did a knucklehead like you become so thoughtful?"
E_C2_Main_17_18,"Shut it! I'll kill you!"
E_C2_Main_17_19,"Phew, don't be shy."
E_C2_Main_17_20,"What a child."
E_C2_Main_17_21,"You little brat!"
E_C2_Main_17_22,"Argh, this feels awkward as hell!"
E_C2_Main_17_23,"...Eh? Huuuuuh?"
E_C2_Main_17_24,"Hey! Say your wish before I change my mind!"
E_C2_Main_17_25,"Darn, I won't say it twice!"
E_C2_Main_17_26,"*Gasp, gasp*"
E_C2_Main_17_27,"...Mirianne."
E_C2_Main_17_28,"A wish..."
E_C2_Main_17_29,"Hmm..."
E_C2_Main_17_30,"Then, Mr. Tree."
E_C2_Main_17_31,"Let all the people we fought today"
E_C2_Main_17_32,"have a happy time… and a wonderful Christmas."
E_C2_Main_17_33,"And..."
E_C2_Main_17_34,"Send the nicest Christmas trees around"
E_C2_Main_17_35,"to Grandpa Ricardo's orphanage and to Neraxis and Lilia's homes."
E_C2_Main_17_36,"Heh heh."
E_C2_Main_17_37,"…"
E_C2_Main_17_38,"Your wish will be granted."
E_C2_Main_17_39,"...Are you sure that's your wish?"
E_C2_Main_17_40,"Yes, I'll be happy with that."
E_C2_Main_17_41,"My wish is something I have to make come true on my own."
E_C2_Main_17_42,"Right, Sonia?"
E_C2_Main_17_43,"...Hahaha."
E_C2_Main_17_44,"As expected of you.. Mirianne."
E_C2_Main_17_45,"You're always kind, unselfish, and caring…"
E_C2_Main_17_46,"...Aw, I do have some selfishness."
E_C2_Main_17_47,"I love pretty clothes, and I always want to have yummy snacks."
E_C2_Main_17_48,"But... I can do all of that with you anytime, Sonia."
E_C2_Main_17_49,"I can't possibly want more than that."
E_C2_Main_17_50,"I will find my past and memory.. by myself."
E_C2_Main_17_51,"So.. this is for the best."
E_C2_Main_17_52,"Heh heh."
E_C2_Main_17_53,"...Oh, Lua."
E_C2_Main_17_54,"The most beautiful thing in the world is..."
E_C2_Main_17_55,"a pure, innocent soul."
E_C2_Main_17_56,"I wish you could learn some of her... Neraxis!"
E_C2_Main_17_57,"What? No! No Christmas tree at my place, no!"
E_C2_Main_17_58,"?????"
E_C2_Main_17_59,"Is it done? Has everything come true?"
E_C2_Main_17_60,"Well... Umm... Yes...?"
E_C2_Main_17_61,"You can't take it back."
E_C2_Main_17_62,"Well, what a bummer. But I guess it can't be helped."
E_C2_Main_17_63,"Kehkehkeh..."
E_C2_Main_17_64,"I guess we could use an extra tree! Kuhahahaha!"
E_C2_Main_17_65,"*Sigh* I knew it."
E_C2_Main_17_66,"Now for revenge! I'll be pulling you out of the ground, Tree! You're my Christmas Tree!"
E_C2_Main_17_67,"The tree I received from the wish is just a freebie!!"
E_C2_Main_17_68,"You'll become the coolest tree that I'm going to bring as the main gift to Laias!!"
E_C2_Main_17_69,"Ewaaaah?"
E_C2_Main_17_70,"Wh-what are you doing...!? Argh! Ewaaah! No! My roots! Somebody help the tree!"
E_C2_Main_17_71,"...Oh, Lua."
E_C2_Main_17_72,"Please save this pitiful soul of a dragon,"
E_C2_Main_17_73,"filled with nothing but greed and arrogance..."
E_C2_Main_17_74,"I'll pull you by the roots, you bastard!"
E_C2_Main_17_75,"Kyaaaaaaahhh!"
E_C2_Main_17_76,"…"
E_C2_Main_17_77,"How... How dare you pull me out!?"
E_C2_Main_17_78,"There'll be no Christmas presents for naughty children like you!"
E_C2_Main_17_79,"Die!"
E_C2_Main_17_80,"Arghhh, you knucklehead! What'd you do!?"
E_C2_Main_17_81,"Kwahahaha, that's what I expected!"
E_C2_Main_17_82,"Come on, you freakin' tree!"
E_C2_Main_17_83,"I'll bring you back with me, no matter what!"
E_C2_Main_6_16_plus,"zZZ…"
