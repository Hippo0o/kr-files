CONVERSATION_TU_8,"Are you all right, Kyle?"
CONVERSATION_TU_9,"Yeah, I'm fine. But I'm worried about everyone who was left behind, damn."
CONVERSATION_TU_10,It's okay. They won't go down so easily. They're strong.
CONVERSATION_TU_11,"If you say so, Tarkas,."
CONVERSATION_TU_12,"Phew...This isn't easy, even for me."
CONVERSATION_TU_12B,"While I knew how tough Demons are,"
CONVERSATION_TU_13,but I didn't think they'd be this persistent. I don't like it when they act all clingy...
CONVERSATION_TU_14,"Isn't that a shame, you traitor."
CONVERSATION_TU_15,!
CONVERSATION_TU_16,Malduk... Of course.
CONVERSATION_TU_17,"Hmph, the very fact that I fell for your foolish plan is an embarassment."
CONVERSATION_TU_18,"I wouldn't be fit to be called the Demon Strategist if I couldn't stop you, here and now."
CONVERSATION_TU_19,"You fought well to get here, but all this ends now!"
CONVERSATION_TU_20,"Ugh! You maggots...! Wait and see, this isn't over yet!"
CONVERSATION_TU_21,"Get lost, Malduk! Geez, such a sore loser."
CONVERSATION_TU_22,"Ha ha, that's as far as you go..."
CONVERSATION_TU_22B,"Onwards, evil spirits!"
CONVERSATION_TU_23,"They're coming at us again, Kyle!"
CONVERSATION_TU_24,We're outnumbered. We can't take them all.
CONVERSATION_TU_25,Ugh. I've also reached my limit.
CONVERSATION_TU_26,"We should pull back, Kyle."
CONVERSATION_TU_26B,Any more and...!
CONVERSATION_TU_27,We can't afford to do that! An opportunity like this won't come again.
CONVERSATION_TU_27B,Let me go! I'll deal with the Dark Lord myself!
CONVERSATION_TU_28,Kyle!
CONVERSATION_TU_29,"Well, if that's what my love wants, I guess I should lend a hand."
CONVERSATION_TU_30,I heard your request. You are my only friend.
CONVERSATION_TU_31,"Tarkas, Epis! No, Kyle! We can't send you alone!"
CONVERSATION_TU_32,"Maria, I'm the only one who can do this job. You know that, right?"

CONVERSATION_TU_36,"Ok, I'll break through! Support me, everyone!"
CONVERSATION_TU_37,"Kyle! No, please, Kyle!!"
CONVERSATION_TU_61,Who goes there? How dare you set foot in here without permission...
CONVERSATION_TU_62,Who are you?
CONVERSATION_TU_63,"I am Gadra, a mighty Troll warrior."
CONVERSATION_TU_64,What is a troll warrior doing here?
CONVERSATION_TU_65,Humph. None of your business.
CONVERSATION_TU_66,What are you doing here?
CONVERSATION_TU_67,This is the pit.
CONVERSATION_TU_68,"Unlike the Arena, this is a dangerous place."
CONVERSATION_TU_69,Heh heh. But the rewards are greater.
CONVERSATION_TU_70,"If you feel up to it, give it a try."
CONVERSATION_TU_71,Stop! Identify yourself!
CONVERSATION_TU_72,"My name is Kasel, a squire in service to Orvelia."
CONVERSATION_TU_73,I have been summoned here.
CONVERSATION_TU_74,"Ahh, you are Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_75,We have been waiting for you.
CONVERSATION_TU_76,We discovered a hidden vault under the royal chambers.
CONVERSATION_TU_77,"Much wealth has been uncovered, but monsters keep appearing."
CONVERSATION_TU_78,We ask that you eliminate the monsters for the safety of Orvelia.
CONVERSATION_TU_79,"I'm at your service, sir."
CONVERSATION_TU_87,"Hello there, young, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_TU_88,"I think someone is calling you, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_89,"Yeah, right..."
CONVERSATION_TU_90,Hello. My name is May and I work at the Shop.
CONVERSATION_TU_91,We're handing out gifts in celebration of our store's grand opening.
CONVERSATION_TU_92,"If you come visit us, sir, we'll have something even more special for you!"
CONVERSATION_TU_93,Th-thank you...
CONVERSATION_TU_94,"Heh, let's go take a look at the shop, young, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_TU_95,"Frey, I'm already embarrassed enough, so please don't..."
CONVERSATION_TU_96,Welcome to May's General Shop!
CONVERSATION_TU_97,"We have weapons and armor that will suit a young, handsome knight!"
CONVERSATION_TU_98,Tap the Shop button to go to the shop!
CONVERSATION_TU_99,"You can use Rubies to refresh the Items list, too!"
CONVERSATION_TU_100,But if you browse and leave without buying anything...
CONVERSATION_TU_101,May will be very disappointed!
CONVERSATION_TU_102,"Heh. Looks like you have no choice, Mr. Young, Handsome Knight."
CONVERSATION_TU_103,"Please stop, Cleo..."
CONVERSATION_TU_104,"About a century ago, a lone wizard opened the Demon's Gate\nand allowed Demons to invade the entire continent."
CONVERSATION_TU_105,"As the land went up in flames, heroes rose up against the Demons."
CONVERSATION_TU_106,The heroes pushed past the Demons\nand arrived at the Dark Lord's fortress.
CONVERSATION_TU_107,"Kyle slew the Dark Lord with the Holy Sword of Aea,\nand then vanished leaving only the holy sword behind."
CONVERSATION_TU_108,"The leaderless Demons dispersed across the continent,"
CONVERSATION_TU_108A,And the heroes sealed the holy sword in the World Tree.
CONVERSATION_TU_109,"A hundred years later, peace has been restored to the continent,\nand the wounds of the old war have been long forgotten."
CONVERSATION_TU_110,"Yet one peaceful day, Demon activity was sensed near the World Tree."
CONVERSATION_TU_111,"Orvel, the realm of humans, sent an expedition party\nto investigate the Demon situation."
CONVERSATION_TU_114,"Kasel, the edge of your sword looks very worn."
CONVERSATION_TU_115,Yeah. I've been using it since I was on the city watch.
CONVERSATION_TU_116,Don't you have a second sword? Why don't you use it?
CONVERSATION_TU_117,Uh... how do I do that?
CONVERSATION_TU_118,"First, tap the Heroes button and select a hero to go to the Hero Info window."
CONVERSATION_TU_119,"Tap the item you want to equip, and then tap the Equip button."
CONVERSATION_TU_120,"It's not hard, give it a try!"
CONVERSATION_TU_121,"Um, the sword is not bad, but something is amiss."
CONVERSATION_TU_122,Then you should enhance the item.
CONVERSATION_TU_123,Enhance?
CONVERSATION_TU_124,All items can be enhanced regardless of their type.
CONVERSATION_TU_125,"Once an item has been enhanced, its abilities are strengthened."
CONVERSATION_TU_126,Enhancing an item is similar to equipping items. Tap the Enhance button instead of Equip.
CONVERSATION_TU_127,"Let's get started, Kasel!"
CONVERSATION_TU_128,Hmm... My skills don't seem to deal much damage to enemies.
CONVERSATION_TU_129,How about acquiring a new skill attribute?
CONVERSATION_TU_130,Skill attribute?
CONVERSATION_TU_131,"Did you finish knighthood training, Kasel?"
CONVERSATION_TU_132,Ha ha ha. Of course I did!
CONVERSATION_TU_133,"Oh well, it can't be helped. Do you have any skill books?"
CONVERSATION_TU_134,"There is an attribute you can pick up with the skill books you already have, Kasel. Let's try it!"
CONVERSATION_TU_135,How do I do that?
CONVERSATION_TU_136,"First, open the Hero window and select the hero whose skills you want to enhance."
CONVERSATION_TU_137,"Tap Skills to open the skills window, and then tap the skill for the attribute you want to acquire."
CONVERSATION_TU_138,There will be an Acquire Attribute button. You can enhance your skill attributes if you have enough skill books.
CONVERSATION_TU_139,Let's give it a try!
CONVERSATION_TU_175,"Not only do you acquire better skill attributes,"
CONVERSATION_TU_176,but you can also enhance skills to a number equal to your current level.
CONVERSATION_TU_177,"Enhancing skills consumes Gold, so be sure to save up for future costs!"
CONVERSATION_TU_178,"Try enhancing your skills, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_179,Hm. That looks like a goblin base.
CONVERSATION_TU_180,Could that be an outpost?
CONVERSATION_TU_181,It's highly likely. I see why the number of goblins have increased.
CONVERSATION_TU_182,I was wondering where they were coming from. It looks like they've set up their camp here.
CONVERSATION_TU_183,Let's destroy it before they attack another village.
CONVERSATION_TU_184,Got it.
CONVERSATION_TU_185,Good. A knight needs that kind of mettle.
CONVERSATION_TU_186,"Lead the way, I'll cover your back."
CONVERSATION_TU_187,Thank you.
CONVERSATION_TU_188,"Huff, puff. That was quite a difficult fight."
CONVERSATION_TU_189,"Yes, but we gained a fair amount of loot at last."
CONVERSATION_TU_190,There may be a few more outposts similar to this one.
CONVERSATION_TU_191,"We have no obligation to dispose them, but we'll get  loot if we do!"
CONVERSATION_TU_192,I'll leave it up to you.
CONVERSATION_TU_193,Sure.
CONVERSATION_TU_194,Then let's keep going.
CONVERSATION_TU_195,"Wait, Kasel."
CONVERSATION_TU_196,"What is it, Frey?"
CONVERSATION_TU_197,The wolves we caught earlier dropped some armor.
CONVERSATION_TU_198,It looks tougher than what you have on right now.
CONVERSATION_TU_199,But the battle is about to start...
CONVERSATION_TU_200,Haha. There is a simple way to equip gear before the battle starts.
CONVERSATION_TU_201,How?
CONVERSATION_TU_202,Tap and hold the portrait of the hero on this screen.
CONVERSATION_TU_203,Then you can jump to the corresponding Hero Info window.
CONVERSATION_TU_204,"Tap the Gear button in the Hero Info window,"
CONVERSATION_TU_205,and then tap the Auto Equip button below.
CONVERSATION_TU_206,This way you can easily equip gear.
CONVERSATION_TU_207,"Wow, that really is helpful!"
CONVERSATION_TU_208,"Thanks, Frey."
CONVERSATION_TU_209,Glad to help.
CONVERSATION_TU_210,Ugh!
CONVERSATION_TU_211,"What's wrong, Miss Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_TU_212,"I was in such a hurry to leave the Tower of the Sages,"
CONVERSATION_TU_213,I forgot my best staff!
CONVERSATION_TU_214,"Of course, it's not like my flames are any weaker without my staff..."
CONVERSATION_TU_215,"Why don't you try the Special Shop, Miss Cleo?"
CONVERSATION_TU_216,Special what?
CONVERSATION_TU_217,You can summon special items from the Special Shop.
CONVERSATION_TU_218,"We may even find high-quality items that suit you, Miss Cleo."
CONVERSATION_TU_219,"Oh... Of course, I knew that. Yes, indeed."
CONVERSATION_TU_220,"Well, let's quickly go to the Special Shop and summon some special items!"
CONVERSATION_TU_221,"Oh no! I left my sword back there... This worn sword, on the other hand..."
CONVERSATION_TU_222,A warrior without his sword. I predict a bleak future.
CONVERSATION_TU_223,Right? Hahaha...
CONVERSATION_TU_224,"Huhu, Kasel! I brought it!"
CONVERSATION_TU_225,"When I was looking for you, I noticed you had left your sword behind in your room..."
CONVERSATION_TU_226,"Wow! Frey, thank you!"
CONVERSATION_TU_227,"You're welcome! In the future, don't leave your equipment laying around!"
CONVERSATION_TU_228,This sword... I feel the great power of the Goddess Lua.
CONVERSATION_TU_229,I wanna try using it!
CONVERSATION_TU_230,The holy sword doesn't reveal its power to anyone but its true owner.
CONVERSATION_TU_236,Try equipping this rune on the Holy Sword Aea.
CONVERSATION_TU_237,Runes enchant gear with special effects.
CONVERSATION_TU_238,This pebble can do that?
CONVERSATION_TU_239,Pebble?!
CONVERSATION_TU_240,Runes are precious artifacts that contain magic powers!
CONVERSATION_TU_241,"Unfortunately, there aren’t too many pieces of equipment that can handle the true power of runes."
CONVERSATION_TU_242,"Ok, ok. Why don't you give it a try, Kasel? Let's see if she's speaking the truth."
CONVERSATION_TU_243,I'm not lying!
CONVERSATION_TU_244,For sure... I can feel more strength compared to before.
CONVERSATION_TU_245,"As you grow stronger, Kasel, you will be able to exert greater powers."
CONVERSATION_TU_246,"I want one of those, too!"
CONVERSATION_TU_247,Roi! Go and find me one! That's an order!
CONVERSATION_TU_248,Don't feel like it.
CONVERSATION_HERO_EMPTY,You have connected with many heroes already!\nPlease come again!
