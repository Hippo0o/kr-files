E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_01,"Ah, there are just too many things to do in the guild."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_02,I'll never get to take a day off for my birthday...
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_03,Ah! There's no time for this. I should get started!
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_04,Huh? You've already finished organizing the training manuals?
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_05,That's right. We had a helping hand today.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_06,A helping hand?
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_07,Someone really reliable pitched in. Don't worry about it.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_08,"Hmm... Alright. I'll see you tomorrow, then."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_09,"Umm... Turan is next, I believe...? ...Oh, dear! She's not on duty today!"
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_10,"It's Mr. Kumuro, then."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_11,Um? What was that just now?
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_12,Huh? No more bookkeeping work for today?
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_13,Of course! It's all finished!
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_14,Already? You normally hand them to me just before I punch out.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_15,Don't worry about it. We actually had two different people on the job today.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_16,"...Okay. See you tomorrow, then."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_17,See you. I hope you have a relaxing day today!
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_18,Hmm... What's happening today...?
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_19,................................
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_20,"I'm sorry, Mr. Havelock. I couldn't get Ikko's favorite food this time."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_21,Hmm? What do you mean? I already received the red eel.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_22,Ikko just finished chowing it down. Hahaha!
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_23,The eel has a very peculiar scar on it. I have never seen such a skill in this continent.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_24,Hahaha... That figures.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_25,Happy birthday. You've got a pretty good friend.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_26,"Thank you. Haha, I think so, too."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_27,"Hey, wait! Turan, stop!"
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_28,"Ah, you got me."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_29,How could I not know? You were helping me with my work on your day off?
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_30,"It's your birthday, but there's too much work."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_31,"You helped me, even though I was a stranger here. I wanted to help, too."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_32,I want you to get some rest. At least for today.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_33,"Heh heh. Thank you, but this is just how I do things."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_34,Don't try to hide next time.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_35,"I'm sorry, Veronica."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_36,Please don't be. Thank you for your kind words.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_37,"I can call it a day, thanks to you! Let's go grab something good to eat!"
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_38,I just want to say this.
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_39,"Happy birthday, Veronica! I'll say this again next year, too."
E_C19_Mar_Veronica01_40,"*Giggle* Thank you, Turan! I'll look forward to it!"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_01,"Hahaha, a lonely island! It's warm and nice."
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_02,"Taking a break was not entirely my choice,"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_03,but this is nice! There's nothing like a relaxing day on the beach!
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_04,"Very... good, Zzz… Zzz…"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_05,"Hmm, are you sure you can pull this off this time?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_06,My friend! When have I ever lied to... *Clears throat* Trust me this time.
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_07,We're here on this deserted island to prevent possible accidents.
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_08,This warp experiment can tell us if we're living in a multi-dimensional world.
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_09,A world like this in a different dimension! How exciting is that?
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_10,"Hmm, I've brought Rephy like you told me to, but..."
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_11,"Wow! It's the sea! Uncle Oddy, can I go swimming?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_12,"Wait a second, fur boy. Could you please do me a favor first?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_13,Yes? What do you want Rephy to do?
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_14,"You know any adventurous souls out there? One that might want to travel to another world, maybe?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_15,Of course! There are many! You want me to call them?
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_16,"Then, could you tell your friends to see what's on the other side of that hole?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_17,"That's easy! Souls, help me!"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_18,"Rephy, wouldn't that be a bit dangerous?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_19,It's alright as long as I just leave out the souls of people taking a nap!
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_20,Huh? No! Noooo! What do I do? A sleeping soul just went inside it!
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_21,What?????!!!!!!
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_22,Umm.. Where am I?
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_23,"Good morning, teacher!"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_24,"Hey, it's the dean! Run!"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_25,Where in the world am I?
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_26,"Mr. Kaulah, what's wrong?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_27,"Today is the day our new semester... Umm, your soul seems different today."
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_28,Where am I...? I was just taking a nap on that island...
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_29,"Hahaha, wake up, Mr. Kaulah!"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_30,"Don't you know? You're... at Orvelia High School, remember?"
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_31,Are you serious?
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_32,What an absurd dream... It is too much for a birthday gift.
E_C19_Mar_Kaulah01_33,Could it be… a precognitive dream?!
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_01,"Welcome, Your Majesty! It's been a long time!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_02,"Nice to see you, Juno. I heard that someone wanted to see me today."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_03,"Yes, a VIP is waiting for you, Your Majesty. This way, please."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_04,"Greetings, Your Majesty, the Empress of Light. It's been a long time."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_05,Greetings to you. I believe that last time we spoke was over tea.
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_06,"How have you been, Princess of Silver?"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_07,"...Pft! Ha, hahahaha!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_08,"We agreed to talk without all these formalities, didn't we?"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_09,"And yet here we are, all stiff and solemn."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_10,"Let's take it slow, Scarlet."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_11,"As you say, Artemia."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_12,Are you okay being out here without your guards?
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_13,It's better this way. Scouting for demon activities will be much more difficult if my identity was revealed.
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_14,"By the way, what brings you here today? Did the Dark Legion start making moves?"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_15,"They didn't, but what I'm here for is no less important."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_16,What is it?
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_17,"Juno, please bring it here!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_18,"Yes, Your Highness. Here it is!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_19,"I hereby present to you, Juno's Special, Royal Plaaned Cake!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_20,Goodness gracious!!!!!! This is the Penteonian royal family's cake!
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_21,"Hahaha, happy birthday, Artemia!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_22,Do you like it?
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_23,"I love it! Thank you, Scarlet..."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_24,I've never imagined that I'd be able to eat this cake in Orvel. I used to have this on my birthdays when I was young...
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_25,"Oh, the taste is exactly the same! How did you do this?"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_26,"The Plaan spice is a key ingredient, but the plant only grows in Penteonia."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_27,"Oh, a friend of mine happens to be a superb alchemist."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_28,"Oh, please introduce me to your friend. I would love to buy some of this spice as well."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_29,"Hahaha, I'll ask if there's any left."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_30,Please help yourself.
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_31,"Thank you so much! Here, have some with me, Scarlet."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_32,"Oh, I'm okay. It's my birthday gift for you, so..."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_33,"Oh no, birthday cakes are meant to be shared! Please, here!"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_34,"Oh, o-okay, then..."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_35,Juno's Room inside the Inn
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_36,Poor Princess Scarlet...
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_37,"Requina, can you make more of that Plaan spice?"
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_38,"Hmm, I need to rip this into tiny pieces and dry them."
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_39,Her Highness helped me a lot before. It'll be impossible to do it on my own.
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_40,This must be cut into more than 100 pieces and then processed to neutralize the toxin.
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_41,I really don't get the strange taste of royal families...
E_C19_Mar_Artemia01_42,"Please be safe, Your Highness."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_01,"Since Princess Scarlet went out to subdue some demons today,"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_02,the castle should be almost empty by now.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_03,................................................................
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_04,..................................................
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_05,I would like to... return this book...
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_06,"Oh, I'm so sorry. My mind just wandered off."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_07,"Um, Blood Chronicles Vol. 4. Your name is... Seria?"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_08,... *Nod*
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_09,Wow! Did you finish reading this huge book already?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_10,There must have been difficult ancient terminologies in it since it's about ancient Vampires...
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_11,...Can I borrow the next volume?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_12,Vol. 5 should contain the records about successful cases of devampirization...
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_13,"Umm... It's a rare book, so you're not supposed to take it outside."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_14,"Well, I'll make an exception of you, just for today..."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_15,Thanks. Take care.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_16,...Since it's my birthday.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_17,...It's just like any other day in the year. I shouldn't feel so...
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_18,Leo~~~~~!
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_19,"Um? Annette! Kara, too!"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_20,Didn't you leave to fight the demons?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_21,Yup! I've gathered enough battle data for Kara.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_22,And how could I go somewhere else on this special day?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_23,*Pitapat* What's so special today?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_24,It's the day that I give you this special ink!
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_25,D-did you really remember?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_26,"Of course! Today is the day I return the rare book, 'Fingerprint of Lua!'"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_27,.......................................................................
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_28,"*Sigh* You mean the book is overdue, Annette. Again!"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_29,"You are 3 weeks late, exactly. You know how much the late fee is then, right?"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_30,It'll cost you more than 10 bottles of that special ink.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_31,"Argh!!! Please, Leo~! I'm broke this month again!!!!"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_32,"I should just put you in the blacklist and not lend you any books, then."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_33,"Boo! That's not fair! You're so mean, Leo!!"
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_34,*Sigh* Seriously? I'm being mean? ...Huh? Kara? Why aren't you going with Annette?
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_35,My current top priority is practicing humanity.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_36,A notification message from Royal Staff Database:
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_37,Today is Leo's 000th birthday.
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_38,"Happy birthday, Leo."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_39,"Ah, th-thank you, Kara."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_40,"Now, I will dance to mark the occasion."
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_41,D-dance? Wow! Thank you!
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_42,A few hours later
E_C19_Mar_Leo01_43,"U-umm... Kara... Thank you for the dance, but please stop..."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_01,The invitation card says it's here... Is it a pub?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_02,"It says 'I'll give you the information you need, so please accept this invitation!'…"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_03,Maybe I'll be able to find where Esker is...
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_04,"This looks awfully suspicious, but I should check... Argh, I'm sorry."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_05,"Hey! Watch where you're going, you fool... Ow!"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_06,...What's that card?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_07,"Ah, I received it this morning. It just had a location and time on it."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_08,Huh? That's just like what we received today.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_09,"I brought the old man for this, just in case this is something big,"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_10,"but this nerdy wimp got invited, too?"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_11,Everything will be clear once we go inside. I'm going in.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_12,...It's dark inside. Hmm?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_13,Everyone is here! Thank you for accepting my invitation!
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_14,"Huh? Cassandra? Hey, did you find me a job that pays decently this time?"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_15,...Umm? Do you and the old man know each other?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_16,...What's the job?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_17,"Oh, why! There's no need to rush things, isn't there?"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_18,All you have to do is just enjoy the dinner show that I prepared to celebrate my birthday!
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_19,...What???
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_20,..........................
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_21,"Oh, Lua, forgive me for wasting precious time."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_22,"Come on, don't be so uptight. It's just a dinner."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_23,...The door is locked.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_24,*Giggle* Don't bother. I raised a barrier around here.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_25,"You all seem like you know one another, but I do not know you."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_26,For what reason did you want me here?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_27,I've told you already. It's a dinner show.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_28,I just wanted to have fun on my birthday..
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_29,with my favorite type of handsome men around me~!
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_30,"Cassandra, it's okay that you invited me, but really? The old man and the wimp?"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_31,Look at them! They're ready to fight you!
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_32,*Giggle* I doubt they could resist my charms.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_33,...This smell... nerve gas?
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_34,Ah... My head is...
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_35,"Don't worry, it won't leave any damage."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_36,"You see, I know a thing or two about these things."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_37,It'll just make the world beautiful and let you be more honest with yourselves.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_38,"Brother, this is my first time meeting you, but you're quite handsome!"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_39,How could you use that huge weapon so easily? That's impressive.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_40,"Right back at you, my friend. I admire your courage. I mean, you came to this sketchy neighborhood with nothing but a flag."
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_41,That tells me you've got guts.
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_42,"Huh? Say something nice about me, too, old man!"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_43,"*Giggle* It can't hurt to relax every once in a while, can it?"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_44,"Furthermore, nothing pleases me more than the smiling faces of handsome men!"
E_C19_Mar_Cassandra01_45,"This is the best birthday gift ever, everyone!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_01,Ladies and gentlemen who are gathered here on this year's Water's Day.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_02,"I, Laias, would like to thank each and every one of you as the Priestess of Golden Shrine."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_03,"Water is the source of all life,"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_04,and what flows past us to our offspring.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_05,Priestess! You look so pretty today!
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_06,"Shut up, knucklehead!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_07,"Hahaha, I won't bore you with long speeches."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_08,"Then, let me commence the purifying ritual of the oasis, the treasure of this desert."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_09,Waaaaaaahhhh!
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_10,"First, I extinguish the evil energy around the sacred oasis."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_11,May the power of flow be with you.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_12,The golden sand storm sweeps away all that's negative.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_13,May the blessings of the God King be with you.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_14,Lastly!
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_15,May the pure water flow over the lands!
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_16,The purifying ritual has ended.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_17,Should we start the real ritual now?
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_18,"Waaa! We were waiting for it, Priestess!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_19,Laias! It was a perfect purifying ritual!
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_20,Wasn't it tiring?
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_21,"Hahaha, not at all."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_22,How could I be tired when all these people are gathered here for us?
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_23,"Urr... L-L-Laias, you were so pr-pre..."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_24,pretty awesome raising that pillar of water back there!
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_25,"Thank you, Neraxis."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_26,The ritual ended well. It's all thanks to you and Lilia.
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_27,"Hahaha! I know, right? Who could do it better than a Black Dragon?"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_28,"Don't get so stuck up, you fool!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_29,"Hmph, you're just being jealous, you little brat!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_30,"You wish, knucklehead!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_31,"Hey, you two! Stop..."
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_32,"You're still so busy, taking care of these children, my love!"
E_C19_Mar_Anniver01_33,Wh-what!? You jerk!
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_01,"It's been a long time, Yuria."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_02,How was your trip this time?
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_03,"Hm hm, it was quite good, your highness."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_04,I went to Orvel and made a dress for a lady.
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_05,"It was such a beautiful dress, it suited her perfectly."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_06,Purple really is a great color for her. Hm hm hm...
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_07,…Purple?
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_08,"Is she, perhaps, from the Daphnel family?"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_09,"Hm hm, was that too obvious?"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_10,She was so adorable and lovely.
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_11,"Well, a pretty harsh fate awaits her..."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_12,"If she can find help from those around her,"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_13,she'll find the strength to overcome the hardships that await her.
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_14,"It's good to hear that, hahaha..."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_15,"How long will you stay here, this time?"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_16,"Umm, isn't it about time for you to get a new dress, your highness?"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_17,"Your birthday is coming up, isn't it?"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_18,I'm looking forward to it.. what kind of dress should I make this time..?
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_19,Is it already that time of the year?
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_20,"Hm hm hm, please don't be shy, your highness."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_21,Was the last dress too unconventional?
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_22,I shall try another design this year...
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_23,*Clearing throat* We can talk about my dress later.
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_24,"After all, I should give you time to settle in, after not having been home for so long,"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_25,"Well, there is something I wanted to give you."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_26,"Oh, this is..."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_27,"Happy birthday, Yuria!"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_28,"Since you're always getting me dresses every year,"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_29,I prepared a couple of boxes of liquor for you.
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_30,I will have the soldiers deliver them to your house.
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_31,"Oh, is today my birthday?"
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_32,"I, myself, did not know that. Hm hm hm..."
E_C19_Mar_Yuria01_33,I lost track of the days and time as I've traveled.
