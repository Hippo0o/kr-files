You never know what lies deep beneath the quicksand."
SQUARE_SIDEQUEST_DESC_EXP,"- Lost EXP Potion\n\nSome merchants were stranded in a blizzard while transporting EXP Potions to soldiers in training across the snow mountains.\nTo make things worse, the EXP Potions in damaged carts are leaking and attracting nearby monsters.\nThe Royal Court is recruiting adventurers to help the merchants before their rescue forces are dispatched.\nIf you help save the merchants, you will get some EXP Potions as a reward, ha ha."
SQUARE_SIDEQUEST_DESC_POWDER,"- Magic Powder of Lava Zone\n\nApparently there's a rare vein of magic ores in a small lava zone southeast of Dragia Volcano.\nThe magic ores are usually ground to make magic powder with mysterious energy, and Jin uses this powder to forge some of the finest gear.\nThe heat near this vein is said to be so severe that most people cannot even get close to it. But for some reason, the heat has died down after someone stopped by the volcano recently.\nYou shouldn't miss this chance to get plenty of Magic Powder, which Jin will always be happy to have more of."
SQUARE_SIDEQUEST_DESC_RUNE,"- Rampaging Rune\n\nRecent rumors say that the runes have grown too powerful at the forest of fairies.\nThe runes are supposed to protect the forest with its powers, but the growing number of runes are making the residents of the forest go on a rampage from absorbing too much Mana.\nThe rampage might stop if the rune's energy within the forest can be weakened.\nHuh? How do you weaken it? Um... I guess getting rid of some runes in the forest should do the trick? Ha ha ha."
SQUARE_SIDEQUEST_DESC_FRAGMENT,"- Fragment of Cursed Land\n\nThere is a small garden at the end of Galluah Plains. They call it the Cursed Land as it's always shrouded by thick fog and vengeful spirits dwell within it.\nRecent rumors say that the place is actually a resting ground for fallen heroes of the Demon War, and the magical fog was cast there with the intention of protecting their eternal peace.\nHa ha ha, it might be a bit dangerous... but if the rumors are true, you might be able to appease the heroes' spirits and obtain fragments of their souls."
