E_C19_September_Gau01_01,Hmm? Yanne? What are you doing here?
E_C19_September_Gau01_02,Preparing a surprise party!\nThis place is going to be crowded this evening.
E_C19_September_Gau01_03,Eh? Is today a special day?
E_C19_September_Gau01_04,Yep. It’s Gau's birthday.
E_C19_September_Gau01_05,What... Today's Uncle Gau's birthday?!
E_C19_September_Gau01_06,He mentioned it briefly while drinking.
E_C19_September_Gau01_07,To think that I actually asked him to go on a raspberry hunt with me today...
E_C19_September_Gau01_08,Hmm... Do you think he was upset because I didn’t know it was his birthday?
E_C19_September_Gau01_09,Did Gau seem like he was having a bad day?
E_C19_September_Gau01_10,"Yes, he didn’t say much when I talked to him. Also, he looked quite depressed all morning."
E_C19_September_Gau01_11,It must be guilt.
E_C19_September_Gau01_12,Pardon? How can someone feel guilty on a birthday?
E_C19_September_Gau01_13,He told me before that he once went on a rampage during his birthday. His fellow Barbarians got hurt quite badly.
E_C19_September_Gau01_14,I guess those memories keep haunting him.
E_C19_September_Gau01_15,Seriously? That gentle bear of a man did that?!
E_C19_September_Gau01_16,He’s so soft that he even refuses to touch a sparrow!
E_C19_September_Gau01_17,"Oh, right. You wouldn’t know of Gau’s past. "
E_C19_September_Gau01_18,"Although he looks like a hairy man with a gentle spirit now,"
E_C19_September_Gau01_19,he was once infamously known as the fiercest warrior in all of the Barbarian Kingdom.
E_C19_September_Gau01_20,Whaaat?! No way!
E_C19_September_Gau01_21,I remember hearing about Gau's exploits when I was young.
E_C19_September_Gau01_22,"Whenever the Barbarian with dual axes walked by, all the villagers would shut their doors, locking themselves up tight."
E_C19_September_Gau01_23,Unbelievable... No way.
E_C19_September_Gau01_24,So the reason he built an orphanage... That's...
E_C19_September_Gau01_25,Perhaps... He desperately wanted to fix his past wrongdoings by doing something good.
E_C19_September_Gau01_26,"Gau... For all this time, I had thought that he’s just a cool, easy-going person..."
E_C19_September_Gau01_27,I didn't realize he carried such a burden...
E_C19_September_Gau01_28,I wish he would let some of his burdens go.
E_C19_September_Gau01_29,"He's already putting in so much effort, trying to rebuild the fallen Barbarian Kingdom."
E_C19_September_Gau01_30,"I know that some people still think of Gau as the nasty person from before,"
E_C19_September_Gau01_31,"but you know him, Rodina."
E_C19_September_Gau01_32,He's a kindhearted person.
E_C19_September_Gau01_33,Of course!
E_C19_September_Gau01_34,"Uncle Gau has such a warm heart. In fact, his heart is so warm that I’m sure it could melt the very snow covering the mountains!"
E_C19_September_Gau01_35,"Ahaha, well said. Anyways, so I invited some special guests for the surprise party!"
E_C19_September_Gau01_36,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to invite Kasel and his friends since they're so far away. "
E_C19_September_Gau01_37,But that shouldn't keep us from throwing an amazing party this evening! Let’s go get ready!
E_C19_September_Gau01_38,Roger that! Is there anything I can do to help?
E_C19_September_Gau01_39,"Well, since I prepared all the meat and booze already,"
E_C19_September_Gau01_40,can you head outside and pick those raspberries that Gau likes?
E_C19_September_Gau01_41,Got it! I'll head out and pick all the snow mountain raspberries for him!
E_C19_September_Gau01_42,Then I’m going to ask Pavel to make us a delicious ice raspberry cake!
E_C19_September_Gau01_43,Great plan!
E_C19_September_Gau01_44,Um... Actually...
E_C19_September_Gau01_45,Will Gau come here for the cake?
E_C19_September_Gau01_46,"Oh, don’t you worry about that!\nI already got the only person who can control Gau on board!"
E_C19_September_Gau01_47,Was I too cold to Rodina?
E_C19_September_Gau01_48,*Sigh* But I’m just not in a mood to do anything.
E_C19_September_Gau01_49,Why did I do something so horrible back then when I was young?
E_C19_September_Gau01_50,Even on my birthdays... 
E_C19_September_Gau01_51,It gives me no right to hurt the people who are dear to me...
E_C19_September_Gau01_52,...?
E_C19_September_Gau01_53,That red light...
E_C19_September_Gau01_54,"Gau, why are you here throwing a pity party all by yourself on your birthday?"
E_C19_September_Gau01_55,L- Lei? 
E_C19_September_Gau01_56,What brings you here?
E_C19_September_Gau01_57,Being depressed won't change the past. 
E_C19_September_Gau01_58,"What’s most important is the present. This moment you are now living in, Gau."
E_C19_September_Gau01_59,Are you just going waste away your precious time on an unpleasant memory?
E_C19_September_Gau01_60,B-but... I’m...
E_C19_September_Gau01_61,Allow me to show you what kind of life you are living now.
E_C19_September_Gau01_62,"Close your eyes, hold my hand, and follow me slowly."
E_C19_September_Gau01_63,Huh? T-this is so sudden...
E_C19_September_Gau01_64,L- Lei? Where are you leading me to? 
E_C19_September_Gau01_65,Open your eyes now. 
E_C19_September_Gau01_66,Gau! Happy birthday! 
E_C19_September_Gau01_67,"Happy birthday, Uncle Gau!"
E_C19_September_Gau01_68,I made you a raspberry cake! You are going to love this!
E_C19_September_Gau01_69,"I will make you an ice harmonica that never melts, Barbarian."
E_C19_September_Gau01_70,Hahaha! You can't expect me to miss out on your birthday!
E_C19_September_Gau01_71,"Besides, snow mountain beers here are the best!"
E_C19_September_Gau01_72,Ah...
E_C19_September_Gau01_73,"They all came to celebrate your birthday, Gau."
E_C19_September_Gau01_74,"This is your life. You are a welcomed, appreciated person, Gau."
E_C19_September_Gau01_75,I... I... T-this...
E_C19_September_Gau01_76,means so much to me. Thank you all...
E_C19_September_Gau01_77,"Oh, we're not done yet, heh."
E_C19_September_Gau01_78,I haven't even revealed my present yet.
E_C19_September_Gau01_79,Huh?
E_C19_September_Gau01_80,"I prepared something special just for you, Gau."
E_C19_September_Gau01_81,"Happy birthday, from the bottom of my heart."
E_C19_September_Gau01_82,Uncle Gau!!!
E_C19_September_Gau01_83,Y-you guys! Irin!
E_C19_September_Gau01_84,Looks like this party was a huge success.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_01,"I wish you a great birthday, Your Highness."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_02,The cheering from the crowd of the afternoon parade was deafening.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_03,"Haha, the people of Orvelia love Her Highness."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_04,I heard even a child dedicated a garland to Her Highness.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_05,"Her Highness should wear an item that fits her royal standing, not a bunch of dirty shrubs."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_06,I’ve actually prepared something for her-
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_07,That would be enough. You are all too much.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_08,Your Highness.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_09,Everyone is waiting for you.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_10,"I will take my leave then. Have a pleasant day, gentlemen."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_11,"You look troubled, Your Highness."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_12,...Do I? I must've made you worry.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_13,"I find myself repeating this every year, but today is your birthday, Your Highness."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_14,Please lay down your worries and enjoy this day.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_15,...Thank you. I will try.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_16,"...Your Highness, may I venture out to find Chase and Clause?"
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_17,It should not take this long to collect firewood.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_18,"Very well, you may go."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_19,Did you go all the way to Ogria for firewood?
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_20,? We did not go there.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_21,"Haha, our apologies, captain. "
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_22,Chase suddenly disappeared during the task. We were late because it took me quite a long time to find him.  
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_23,You are all... Never mind.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_24,Go guard Her Highness.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_25,"Is there something wrong, captain?"
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_26,"Ever since morning, it seems that Her Highness is feeling down."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_27,I assume she’s contemplating over the incident that took place at her birthday banquet 3 years ago.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_28,I do not know about that.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_29,Eh... Um... Are you referring to that incident when an assassin tried to assassinate His Majesty during Her Highness' royal birthday banquet
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_30,"that lead to the exacerbation of His Majesty’s condition, captain?"
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_31,No need to hush over it. He deserves to know.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_32,"We captured that assassin immediately on-site,"
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_33,"but no matter how hard we interrogated him, the assassin would only repeat that his client is Princess Scarlet."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_34,(So the true culprit was not identified till the end.)
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_35,"Every year, whenever Her Highness Princess Scarlet’s birthday approached, people would gossip about that incident."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_36,Her Highness couldn't even relax and celebrate her birthday.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_37,"Those nobles... They flatter Her Highness in front, but they start gossiping as soon as they turn away. The very sight of it infuriates me..."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_38,Captain Demia...
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_39,I'm glad that she’s at least spending her birthday outside the royal palace this year.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_40,...Looks like I went overboard and spoke too much.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_41,Pretend you haven't heard any of this. Stay silent and guard Her Highness.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_42,"...Understood, captain."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_43,Your Highness. I apologize for being late.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_44,Be at ease. I was watching the lake while waiting.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_45,Watching the silent lake calmed my mind. Time just flew by.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_46,Your Highness...
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_47,Chase..?!
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_48,I heard today is your birthday.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_49,(That insensitive fool! I told him over and over not to disturb Her Highness!)
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_50,Your birthday should be a happy day. You don't look happy.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_51,That’s-
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_52,That’s why I will give you this.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_53,This is... a garland.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_54,Clause taught me how to make this. We made it together.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_55,Demia is worried about the princess. Demia sad.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_56,Princess must laugh. Only then others can all laugh.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_57,Chase...
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_58,"I apologize for making you all worry, and I also thank you all for what you’ve done."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_59,The support from all of you... is the most precious thing to me.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_60,I am glad that you are all on my side. I am relieved.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_61,I'm delighted to see Her Highness smile this day.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_62,"However, I do not fully trust him yet..."
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_63,"Captain, although I understand your concern,"
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_64,it wouldn’t hurt to compliment Chase for his achievement today.
E_C19_Sep_Scarlet_65,I will if he successfully fulfills his duty of escorting Her Highness back.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_01,"In the very beginning, Goddess Lua created all life and bestowed each of them with unique traits."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_02,"Her creations shine brightly, burning through the flames called life."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_03,"However, they are weak, foolish beings who harm themselves and doubt their own capabilities to no end."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_04,An Angel!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_05,(What? My disguise was perfect! How did he recognize that I’m an Angel?)
E_C19_Sep_Arch_06,Your wings... are like angel wings! They're so white and soft!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_07,"I saw guys and girls with wings before,"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_08,"but I’ve never seen such white, pretty wings!"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_09,Ah... I see.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_10,"Anyway, human, what have you called me for?"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_11,"Oh, I just called you because your wings looked pretty!"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_12,...
E_C19_Sep_Arch_13,Hey! Don’t go just yet!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_14,I actually have a favor to ask you!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_15,I refuse.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_16,Please! Just for a minute!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_17,Today is my sister’s birthday! I want to give her a meaningful present!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_18,What has that got to do with me?
E_C19_Sep_Arch_19,"Well, my sister always stays at home because she’s not well."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_20,"Since you look like an Angel, I thought she would feel better if"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_21,you could cheer her up by telling her that she'll get well soon...
E_C19_Sep_Arch_22,"And like I said, it’s her birthday today... It’s just more meaningful if that happens today."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_23,What is so special about a birthday?
E_C19_Sep_Arch_24,It’s just a day you were born.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_25,Uh... Umm... I guess that’s true...
E_C19_Sep_Arch_26,(What is this? Does he hate birthdays or something?)
E_C19_Sep_Arch_27,Mom told me that a birthday is not just a day for celebration.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_28,It's a day of welcoming you into this world!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_29,Welcome?
E_C19_Sep_Arch_30,"Mom also said that when you are a baby, you always stay with your family,"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_31,"but when you grow older, the world you see and feel gets bigger too."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_32,So it can feel overwhelming and lonely to stand in this world on your own.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_33,That’s why we celebrate birthdays! To show that we will stay together until the end!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_34,...
E_C19_Sep_Arch_35,You’ve never had that experience?
E_C19_Sep_Arch_36,"Like getting celebrated at your birthday party, or celebrating others?"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_37,The Goddess created us with a purpose. Having such emotions would be a sign of disloyalty. 
E_C19_Sep_Arch_38,"Our duty is to judge and condemn evil, given by the Goddess herself."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_39,We already have a strong conviction of the meaning of our existence. We do not need birthdays like you.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_40,But even the other high priests celebrated birthdays...
E_C19_Sep_Arch_41,They actually blessed our birthdays even more... 
E_C19_Sep_Arch_42,I think you're more strict than our priests.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_43,"They may follow the Goddess' will, but they are only humans."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_44,You humans burn your own body in doubt and anxiety.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_45,Your words are too hard to understand...
E_C19_Sep_Arch_46,When is your birthday?
E_C19_Sep_Arch_47,I awakened this same day.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_48,"Oh, then your birthday is the same as my sister!"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_49,Are you going to host a birthday party today too?
E_C19_Sep_Arch_50,"*Sigh*... I knew younger humans are foolish, but this... "
E_C19_Sep_Arch_51,I told you I don't need a birthday. Birthdays are for creatures like humans who always doubt-
E_C19_Sep_Arch_52,What?! That means nobody ever wished you a happy birthday!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_53,That’s not good!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_54,Celebrating a birthday also means welcoming you to this world.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_55,"If no one welcomes you, even an adult like you will get lonely!"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_56,"Stop...Let go of your hand at once, human!"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_57,"Come with me to my home! Since today is also my sister’s birthday, we can celebrate yours as well!"
E_C19_Sep_Arch_58,I said I don’t need it!
E_C19_Sep_Arch_59,Angels are beings created by Lua herself to realize her will.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_60,"We are Lua’s servants, created with a specific goal and purpose."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_61,"Our flame belongs to Goddess Lua, and her alone."
E_C19_Sep_Arch_62,That is why we are not afraid of being thrown out in the world alone.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_63,We also never feel lonely.
E_C19_Sep_Arch_64,"However, the warmth of the boy’s hand that day was..."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_1,"Chrisha, here’s your birthday present."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_2,"Don't let this distract you from your work, however."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_3,There’s nothing special or grand about birthdays.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_4,Understood? You should never let your guard down and leave yourself unprepared.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_5,"Yes, father."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_6,I will never forget that. I will not bring dishonor to our family’s name.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_7,"So, you were here after all."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_8,Is something the matter?
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_9,I have not received report of any serious task that requires the two of you.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_10,"I heard today is your birthday, Commander Chrisha."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_11,We have come to congratulate-
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_12,...Are you still working?
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_13,I am an Imperial Inquisitor and the captain of the Magic Knights.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_14,I cannot allow myself to rest and neglect my duty for personal reasons. Birthday included.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_15,*Sigh*
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_16,Fufufu. Rigid as a wooden plank. That’s the Chrisha I know.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_17,But I’ve prepared a gift that would suit you nicely.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_18,...I do not comprehend. And this is...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_19,"Commander Chrisha, for your devotion towards the empire,"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_20,His Majesty has rewarded a special vacation.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_21,"Which means! You don't have to- no, you are not allowed to work today!"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_22,...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_23,"Happy birthday, Chrisha."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_24,Congratulations.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_25,...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_26,Thank you. You may leave now.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_27,Huh?
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_28,Can't you see that I’m still attending to my duty? I have received His Majesty’s will. You may leave now.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_29,...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_30,"Again, I expected this to happen."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_31,"Which is why I came prepared. I’m counting on you for this, Glenwys."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_32,"Yes, sir. Leave it to me."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_33,"(They seem to get along well... Anyhow, I wish they would stop being so noisy and just leave me alone.)"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_34,What are you doing?!
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_35,"Forgive me for this, Commander Chrisha!"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_36,"Thanks for everything, Sir Fluss!"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_37,"Fufufu. Do not worry, and have fun!"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_38,*Sigh*
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_39,I demand an explanation. I'm nearly at my limit now.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_40,"Forgive me for my rude intrusion, Commander Chrisha... I sincerely apologize for disrupting your work."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_41,"To tell you the truth, for days, I have wondered what might be a good present for you."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_42,"Nothing came up to my mind, and that’s when Sir Fluss suggested me this..."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_43,...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_44,*Sigh*... Very well.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_45,You even have the direct order from His Majesty. It's not like I can run away.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_46,It’s just that...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_47,Yes?
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_48,I’ve never taken a day off or celebrated my birthday until now.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_49,I just don’t know what I should do.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_50,Goodness... What do you normally do during your break then?
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_51,"A game of chess, reading books... My activities during break are all intellectually stimulating ones."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_52,One should never waste her time at any given chance.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_53,Hm... If that’s the case...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_54,Commander Chrisha! Allow me to guide you through today.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_55,Guide me? You?
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_56,"Although I'm not sure if you would enjoy recreational activities of commoners,"
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_57,today is a special day. I shall try my best to make this birthday a pleasant and fun day to remember.
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_58,*Sigh*... If you insist...
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_59,"You may lead me, Glenwys."
E_C19_Sep_Chrisha01_60,"Right away! Thank you for giving me the honor, Commander Chrisha."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_01,That was greaaaat. Juno’s food is always the best!
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_02,You're welcome. No drinks today?
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_03,"Nah, I'll pass. I have somewhere to go today."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_04,It’s not like you to skip a drink... Is everything alright?
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_05,"Yeah I’m fine, don’t worry. I’m a priest, after all. There are some days when I live by the rules."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_06,Haha. I'll be leaving now. Until next time!
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_07,How would I know my birthday when I don't even know what my real name is?
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_08,"I may have never had one, but I never wanted one.\nOr more like, I didn't have the time to realize I wanted one."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_09,It wasn't until a long time had passed after father took me into the church
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_10,that I was able to catch my breath and think about more than just surviving.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_11,About 12 years ago. Church of Lua.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_12,...
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_13,"Ah, you're here."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_14,What are you looking at so closely?
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_15,There were priests singing
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_16,a hymn to celebrate a boy’s birthday in the dining hall.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_17,"I had never seen people sing a hymn instead of a birthday song,"
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_18,so I was just sitting there listening.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_19,"Ah, a birthday party. Do you want to join them?"
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_20,No. Why would I? I just find it strange that they are singing a hymn instead of a birthday song.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_21,...
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_22,"What my father was thinking at that time, I do not know."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_23,Maybe he was pitying the boy
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_24,who’s never celebrated his own or the birthday of others.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_25,But I had never wished for my birthday to be celebrated by others.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_26,I didn't have a birthday to start with.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_27,"Even if I had a birthday, my father would be the only one who would celebrate it."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_28,It would have been awkward with just the two of us
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_29,sitting down with a cake in between.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_30,"A week had passed since that day, and my father asked me to come out."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_31,"Back then I did not realize it,"
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_32,but that day was when we had first met a year ago.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_33,"Hey, old man! Old maaan!"
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_34,That’s not how you address your mentor!
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_35,"What's the problem with calling an old man an old man? And where are we going anyways? It’s getting really dark here, you know."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_36,"For dinner, of course. You were always complaining about church meals being full of vegetables."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_37,The restaurant was alright. The food was decent and plentiful.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_38,We went for a long walk after the meal.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_39,It was our time to talk to each other comfortably without having to be conscious of others.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_40,That very day became the day we go out for dinner outside every year.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_41,"That is, for 10 years until he passed away."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_42,"Although that may seem like nothing to others, those dinners\nwe had outside were my special childhood memories."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_43,...
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_44,"Hey pops, it’s me."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_45,"Have you heard? That restaurant you used to take me to, the owner retired not too long ago. That restaurant is gone now."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_46,That’s why I went to my favorite restaurant. That place is pretty good as well. You would've enjoyed it too.
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_47,"Other than that, everything’s pretty much the same."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_48,"...Pops, you gave me and taught me a lot. Even more so than you think."
E_C19_Sep_Baudouin01_49,"Thanks. It wasn't a bad choice after all, to follow you outside that day."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_01,"Ha, it's a success! Now I can get my birthday celebrated by Laias first!"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_02,How did I come up with such a brilliant idea of sleeping together for this? I feel like I’ve become smarter.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_03,"Well, other than Laias, there are the children of the desert who would congratulate me on my birthday."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_04,That knucklehead is probably too stupid to know when my birthday is.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_05,As for that annoying fly... I don’t need any gifts from him. I just want him not to appear at all.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_06,"Putting that aside, I’m so excited for today! I wonder what kind of present Laias is going to give me today!"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_07,"Oh, hey Lilia. You're up early. Have you slept well?"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_08,"Oh, good morning, sis!"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_09,"Morning! Since today is your birthday, why don't we go out after lunch?"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_10,Sure! Sounds good! Let’s go out! Just the two of us!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_11,"Sure. Oh, by the way, do you want me to give you the present while lighting the birthday candles after dinner?"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_12,No! Now! You can give it to me now! The cake can wait!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_13,Ahaha. Very well then...
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_14,"Here you go. Happy birthday, Lilia. Thank you for being such a good, healthy sister."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_15,W-wooow... Thank you so much! I’ve always wanted this!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_16,"Happy birthday, brat!"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_17,?!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_18,What? Just take the present already.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_19,"Um... Okay... Thanks, I guess?"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_20,"Good morning, Neraxis. I’m surprised you remembered her birthday."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_21,Of course I remembered! She’s your sister!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_22,"By the way, getting that present was an adventure on its own. That thing was awfully hard to find. But I..."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_23,...
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_24,Lilia.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_25,Happy birthday. We hope you have a great birthday today.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_26,Heyyy! Thanks for the present!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_27,This is just a small gift we’ve prepared for you.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_28,And this... is something we were asked to give to you.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_29,"W-what... What is this? I, uh... I mean... Sure. I’m impressed that you carried this all the way here with your human body."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_30,"With the ability to control desert sands, it is not that challenging."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_31,"Aha. So who made- I mean, who asked you to send this to me?"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_32,That’s...
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_33,...No way.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_34,"Yes. The God King, he..."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_35,"As you already know, tomorrow is that little girl's birthday."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_36,"I would like to give her a gift as she’s the sister of Laias,"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_37,but we all know that we are not on good terms.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_38,"As a king, it would not be appropriate for me to spoil her birthday by traveling to her house."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_39,"Then again, as a king, I should also show her my good will. Which is why I need you to be my envoy."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_40,Ah... Ahahaha.....
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_41,"This is the God King’s gift to you to congratulate your birthday. He appreciates you in his own way, Lilia."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_42,Please accept his good will...
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_43,No!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_44,Never!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_45,Not in a million years!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_46,"But on the other hand, if I don't receive it, you will be in trouble, so I have to!"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_47,......
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_48,Oh my... Is that your statue? It’s so big. It’s really nice-looking as well!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_49,Is this one of the gifts for you?
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_50,"Um... Yep. That annoying fl- I mean, Cain’s gift."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_51,I see! How are you liking it? You've never received a gift like this before.
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_52,"Ah... Ahaha... It’s, uh..."
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_53,(How do I say that it's too much when they're all smiling like that?!)
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_54,I-uh... I like it! It's quite... uh... amusing!
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_55,"Then let’s put this near the entrance. Sorry, but could you help us out one more time, Zafir?"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_56,Ah... No... That knucklehead is going to make fun of-
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_57,"Ahahaha! Hey, brat! What is this thing?! Ahahahahahaha!"
E_C19_Sep_Lilia01_58,Nooooooo...
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_01,The spirits are telling me that they are feeling the energy of birth.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_02,"Uncle Oddy, could it be that it’s your birthday?"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_03,Hm... Birthday...
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_04,Uncle Oddy’s birthday is next month. Rephy has to wait.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_05,"How about you? When is your birthday, Uncle Nyx?"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_06,Birthday... That word brings back some memories.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_07,"I didn't really think about it for a while... But come to think of it, I think it's today."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_08,The spirits were correct! They inform Rephy so many things!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_09,What?!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_10,Why have you not told me something that important!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_11,I thought we were close friends! Was it just my imagination?!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_12,"Hahaha... Take it easy, friend. You don't have to get so angry."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_13,It’s just that I don't really think of my birthday as something to remember.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_14,"It's not because I don't think of you as a friend. Obviously, you're one of my closest friends."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_15,Hmph! You wait here and don’t move an inch.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_16,We are going to make your birthday something you will never forget!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_17,Rephy! Let’s go and prepare for the celebration.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_18,Birthday parties are always so exciting!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_19,Uncle Nyx must get excited for it too! We are going to prepare something amazing for you!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_20,Let’s see what they prepare.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_21,"Haha, I suppose I could just wait for them as they prepare for my birthday celebration..."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_22,BAM! POW! (1st Attempt)
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_23,Rephy! Two more sacks of sugar!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_24,"Okay, Uncle Oddy!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_25,"Spirits, help Rephy!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_26,*Explodes*
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_27,"Hmm.. That didn't work. Let's try again, Rephy."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_28,Okay!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_29,...
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_30,BOOM! POW! (4th Attempt)
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_31,Rephy! Three bottles of milk!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_32,"Okay, Uncle Oddy!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_33,Time Fragments!!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_34,*Explodes*
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_35,Hmm.. That didn't work. Again!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_36,Okay!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_37,...
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_38,BOOM! POW! (13th Attempt)
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_39,Salvation!!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_40,Time Distortion!!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_41,Rephy!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_42,Uncle Oddy!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_43,BUMP!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_44,...
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_45,"We’ve kept you waiting long enough, friend!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_46,Uncle Nyx! We are here!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_47,This is the birthday present we’ve prepared.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_48,Ta-da!!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_49,"Happy birthday, Uncle Nyx!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_50,"Happy birthday, friend!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_51,"Thank you very much, friend! Thank you as well, little furry friend."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_52,"Unfortunately, my birthday ends in 2 minutes though."
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_53,Oh no!!!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_54,Hahahaha.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_55,"In that case, I have no choice but to use this as a last resort! Time Distortion! Max charge!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_56,I've used all the time particles I gathered over the past decade to make time around us go as slow as possible!
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_57,This will buy us about 10 minutes! I think.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_58,"Uncle Oddy! You are amazing! Happy birthday again, Uncle Nyx!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_59,"Huff... Huff... Happy birthday for real this time, friend!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_60,Hahaha... This really is an unforgettable gift.
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_61,"Alright then, let’s cut the cake now, shall we!"
E_C19_Sep_Nyx01_62,Finale!
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_01,*Sigh*
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_02,"Is everything alright, Aselica?"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_03,I am alright. Let’s continue with the training.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_04,...
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_05,"No, this will do. We should end our training for today."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_06,"If I remember correctly, today is the day you awakened."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_07,You are correct. What about it?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_08,"Humans call the day they were born, a birthday."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_09,"Apparently, it is a day when everyone gathers around and celebrates one's birth."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_10,...The cycle of life and death that humans go through carries no meaning for us.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_11,"We were made to realize Lua’s will, and that is our sole purpose."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_12,Indeed. We were made and awakened for that purpose.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_13,"However... you must know this too, don’t you?"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_14,We can never possess power stronger than the power Lua granted us.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_15,...!
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_16,Further training will only drain our strength.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_17,I believe taking a rest to preserve our strengths for the battle in the future is also something we can do for our Goddess.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_18,I see... understood.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_19,(Birthday...)
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_20,"(Now that I recall, I remember hearing about this before.)"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_21,Did you know that humans call the day they were born a birthday?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_22,"For you, Aselica, since today is the day you awakened, you can call this day your birthday."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_23,"Happy birthday, Aselica!"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_24,Ha...
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_25,(It was such a long time ago that I forgot about it.)
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_26,"(I told her that for Angels, birthdays are meaningless.)"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_27,"(However, she insisted to sing me a song to celebrate my birthday.)"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_28,"(Yes, just like this...)"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_29,What the?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_30,Lalala!
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_31,*Sigh* this doesn't feel right.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_32,"The chord should be correct, but... What could be the issue here?"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_33,...Your pitch is flat by one semitone.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_34,I believe you're having that problem because tuning is different for instruments used by Angels.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_35,Hmm? Kyah!!
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_36,Y-you are?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_37,"My apologies for surprising you. I am Aselica, the Guardian Knight of the Angels."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_38,The sound of a familiar tune drew me here.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_39,That song... Where did you hear that from?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_40,I... I learned it from my friend who serves Lua.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_41,"My friend told me that it's a song from a hundred years ago, the time when the Dark Lord Angmund resurrected."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_42,"Apparently, a nameless priest from the Church of Lua sang this song to those who were suffering at that time."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_43,A nameless priest...
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_44,Some people say that it was actually a benevolent Angel who pitied the humans.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_45,An Angel sang a hymn for the humans?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_46,That cannot be true.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_47,Angels only act for the Goddess and nothing else.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_48,"Oh, is that right?"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_49,Well... A myth is a myth after all.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_50,Perhaps someone mistook her as an angel.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_51,Of course. There’s no way an angel like that would exi-
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_52,...
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_53,Um... Are you alright?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_54,"Ah, yes... It’s nothing."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_55,I actually have a request for you. Would you sing me that song you just sang?
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_56,It’s a song which my precious friend sang to me
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_57,"a long ago on my 'birthday,' as humans would describe it."
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_58,Of course. I was practicing it anyway.
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_59,(Ah... What a beautiful voice...)
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_60,"(Emotions make us weak, and stray us from the path of Goddess Lua.)"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_61,"(That is why I suppressed my emotions, setting self-control as a virtue.)"
E_C19_Sep_Aselica_62,(But this... warmth that spreads throughout my heart... What is this feeling?)
