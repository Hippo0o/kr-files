E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_01,It's cold! Why should we come to this snow mountain in this early morning!
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_02,Huh? Rodina?!
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_03,"Good morning, Mitra. Long time, no see."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_04,"I heard that you retired, but I didn't expect to see you here."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_05,"Hm hm, I wouldn't imagine running into you outside of the Empire Shooting Contest."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_06,What brings you here?
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_07,I came here to help Fluss today.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_08,Huh? You too?
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_09,"Oh, dear! I'm running a bit late. The two of you are here, so we're waiting for one more."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_10,"Hey! What is this about? I came here because the old man ordered me to, but I didn't get any of the details.."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_11,"Just wait a little bit. Oh, she's here!"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_12,Sooooorry! Is Luna late?
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_13,"(So, so cute!)"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_14,"Oh, no. What's with this kid? What are we doing?"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_15,All of you will help me today to do this!
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_16,We'll find the Immortal Rose which grows only on this snow mountain.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_17,"First, Luna? Can you remember its scent and find it under the snow?"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_18,"Okay! Luna can smell through the snow, too! Oh! I can smell there, too!"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_19,It seems that all you need is that kid to find it. Why are we here?
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_20,It's not that simple. You will see soon enough. Get ready.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_21,????
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_22,Here! The rose is here! Whaaa! Go away! Monster!
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_23,"Let's go, hurry!"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_24,"Dang it! Kid, are you alright?"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_25,"Hey, what is that monster?"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_26,I would say it's like a guardian that protects the Immortal Rose.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_27,"It's an enemy we'll inevitably need to defeat to get the Rose. Hey, show me what you all got."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_28,We're doing all this just to get some flower?
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_29,"It's quite rude to say that about the rose that never loses its beauty, even after its plucked."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_30,I have... your order.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_31,"I should have known there'd be trouble when the old man told me to go... Dang, this is a hassle."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_32,"Luna will fight, too!"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_33,"Hm hm, they really are the best in the Empire."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_34,"Now, then, let's go for the next rose!"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_35,Evening on the same day.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_36,I don't know who you are.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_37,I just... know you as a good lady from a story my grandpa told me...
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_38,"With your sacrifice, our family and I were able to be here today."
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_39,"I may not be able to meet you,"
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_40,but I admire and respect you with all my heart.
E_C19_Jun_Fluss01_41,Please celebrate my birthday together. Immortal Lady...
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_01,"Today's the day, Mr. Schute!"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_02,"Yes, Shea! Today is the day. I'm feeling pretty nervous. Are you ready?"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_03,Of course! I made a promise with Mr. Schute last year!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_04,"On the 16th birthday, I should sing a song at this square."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_05,"Uh, ummm. F# is here, and G is..."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_06,"Ouch, my ears! Haha, look at your fingers, shaking! Don't worry, we can just do it as we practiced."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_07,But I get too nervous when I stand in front of a crowd.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_08,"Calm down, Shea. We do have some time, so let's practice a bit more."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_09,"Okay, let's go somewhere quiet."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_10,I can sing whatever I want here!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_11,"*Rustle*, *Flap*, *Flap*... *Rustle*"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_12,Someone's coming!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_13,I hear... this heavenly melody...
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_14,"This place is a bit creepy, but no one will be coming here, right, Mr. Schute?"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_15,"Hmm, I feel strong demonic energy here, but it's good for building courage. Let's start!"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_16,Let's begin!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_17,*Thump*! *Clump*!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_18,What! Someone's really coming!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_19,It can't be...I hate ghosts! No way!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_20,Just now... That song was a lullaby from my mother.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_21,*Cough* Shea! Where are we? Is this a sandstorm?
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_22,"I'm sorry, Mr. Schute. I was looking for a place without any people and ended up here."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_23,"Let's practice one last time! After this, let's go back to the square."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_24,"*Thump*, *Flap*, *Flap* Kyaaa!"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_25,Kyahh! D... Dragon?
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_26,"Hey, don't be afraid! I just wanted to know what the song is. Wait!"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_27,What happened...? It's already night!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_28,No one's here. Mr. Schute. I wanted to... *sob* play in front of many people...
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_29,I should just forget about singing. I can't be a bard.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_30,There's no bard who's as shy as I am... Nobody is.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_31,Shea...
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_32,Don't say that!
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_33,No muse in the heavens has a voice like yours.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_34,That's right! Your song... It reminds me of the lullabies my mother would sing.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_35,I can't recall the last time when my heart felt such peace. I was really touched after hearing your song.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_36,Hey! Don't ever think about giving up on singing.
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_37,"Your song was the best! Well, Laias sings, uh, better, though. Ahem!"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_38,"Thank you, everyone..."
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_39,But who are you guys?
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_40,"(... An angel, demon, and Dragon? Not even the Emperor could bring this group together. Shea.)"
E_C19_Jun_Shea01_41,(Now we have 3 more in the fan club! Heh heh!)
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_01,Hmph! Today is the day!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_02,Should I do some cleaning?
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_03,"Thank you for coming to the event today, which only happens once a year."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_04,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Disguise Fight Championship!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_05,"Let me introduce last year's champion, the Beauty Viking!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_06,"Pathetic. Go away, losers!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_07,Waaaaa! Please stomp on them!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_08,"And now, any challengers?"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_09,I challenge her.
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_10,She is...! The rookie that was the first runner-up 2 years ago!!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_11,Here comes with Spring Bride!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_12,"I've been waiting for this moment! Nic... I mean, Beauty Viking!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_13,... Just don't let me get bored.
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_14,Urgh... I'll train harder...
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_15,"Hmm, that was alright. But you need more than a hundred years to beat me."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_16,Victory to the Beauty Viking!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_17,Are there any other challengers?
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_18,I will fight the champion.
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_19,"Wow! A beautiful outlaw of the sea! It's a new contender, Blonde Pirate!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_20,Surrender if you care for your life. My sword shows no mercy.
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_21,Huh! You're quite confident!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_22,I shall see how long you can remain that way!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_23,"Urgh... I admit it, I lost."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_24,"Haha... But you were decent, Blonde Pirate."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_25,"Our champion, Beauty Viking! No one can stop her."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_26,"Now, it's time for the main event!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_27,The founder of the Disguise Fight Championship!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_28,"The former Champion and last year's first runner-up, Catnip Lover!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_29,"Hahaha, it's been a while, everyone!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_30,"How have you been, Nicky?"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_31,"Shut up, stupid cat! Call me Beauty Viking!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_32,"Oh, right! We're not supposed to use our real names!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_33,"Whatever! Let's fight, Champion!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_34,"Hm hm, That's what I want."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_35,Ugh! Dang it!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_36,"Haha! Nicky, you're still really good, but I won this time!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_37,"Urgh, don't call me by my real name! You cat!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_38,Here comes our new champion!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_39,This year's champion is Catnip Lover!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_40,Wagggghhhh!
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_41,"Hahaha! Thank you, everyone! It was fun!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_42,"Oh, Beauty Viking! I'll expect to see you next year, too!"
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_43,"Haha, stupid cat. You better keep your claws sharp."
E_C19_Jun_Nicky01_44,"Next year's title is mine, don't forget that!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_01,Welcome! Come on in!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_02,Today's the only day to taste our special dishes!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_03,Food truck of Dragon Slayers!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_04,Food truck? What are they selling?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_05,All sorts of dishes made with rare ingredients that I prepared!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_06,A taste recognized by true gourmets! They're only being sold today!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_07,"All revenue will be donated to Barbarian Orphanage, so please come and enjoy."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_08,"Then, should we try one?"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_09,Oh! It smells nice! What is this?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_10,"Oh, that dish is pretty avant-garde. It's like a black pudding."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_11,Pudding made with blood of Hellhound smoked with chili powder.
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_12,B-blood you said?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_13,How much is it? Give me all you have. Right now! Now!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_14,"Oh, alright. Hey, here you are!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_15,"Haha, I won't need to hunt for a while!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_16,We normally have a bunch left over... but it sold out this time? Haha...
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_17,This melancholic and sad aroma! This coffee must be...!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_18,"The best coffee of the Empire, Lotus Eater! How can it be here?"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_19,"Uh? Oh! That's made with coffee bean swallowed by Slimes in Swamps of Gargoss, right?"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_20,"I got a request to hunt Slimes recently, so I was able to get a lot afterward."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_21,"I didn’t know it was that famous, though."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_22,It is such a rare coffee that it's priceless. But it's so cheap here!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_23,"I almost got them for nothing. If you'd like, buy as much as you want!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_24,"Thank you. Then, I shall buy…. This much."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_25,"Heh! Business today is going well, huh?"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_26,"I should be able to buy some gifts for kids at the orphanage, too."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_27,"*Sniff*, *Sniff*... That delicious smell..."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_28,Welcome! What's your favorite dish?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_29,...Meat! It's a delicious meat!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_30,"Hey, you need to pay. Mad Dragon Meat isn't free!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_31,Money? What's that? People keep asking me about it after I got here.
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_32,In my homeland… there is no such thing.. We just hunt and eat.
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_33,"Hmm, so you're a foreigner?"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_34,"Hey, listen. You need to pay if you want to eat food that's for sale."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_35,Then... I cannot eat meat?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_36,I have not had anything to eat since yesterday...
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_37,Glurp...
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_38,"Argh! Well, I don't know."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_39,"I wanted to help the kids, anyway..."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_40,"Just for today, I'll give it to you for free. It's my birthday."
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_41,"Thank you! So much! I love meat, a lot!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_42,Good person! Give meat! Good and Nice! Happy birthday!
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_43,Alright! Thanks for wishing me a happy birthday.
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_44,"Yanne, happy birthday!"
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_45,Did you have a lot of customers today?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_46,Eh?
E_C19_Jun_Yanne01_47,"But, how much are you going to eat...?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_01,Son! Wake up! Today's your birthday.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_02,I made 'that' for your breakfast. Get up and...
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_03,!!
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_04,... I should cook 'that' for today.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_05,'That?'
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_06,Crème brûlée.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_07,What?
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_08,Crème brûlée.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_09,In here?
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_10,"I can get somewhat similar to milk in the desert, and I can use a kiln instead of an oven."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_11,The problem will be sugar and eggs.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_12,(He's really going to do it...)
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_13,I'll ask some people we met before in the desert.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_14,Sure.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_15,"Oh, Theo. It's been a while. You really helped us out last time."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_16,I just did what I had to do.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_17,"Even so, we're still grateful. What brings you here, today?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_18,"Oh, that's..."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_19,"I wanted to cook something, so I wanted to ask for some help with the ingredients..."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_20,"I suppose you'd probably need some utensils, too. So, what did you need?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_21,"I need milk, eggs and sugar. A bit of vanilla as well. It'll be great if I can use an oven as well."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_22,I can get you those.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_23,"So, are you making a dessert? It should be a special occasion if you're going through all this trouble, especially here."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_24,It's just one of those days. I just felt like eating it.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_25,"Really, that's all?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_26,Yes.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_27,"Alright, then. The oven's over on this side."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_28,Is it done?
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_29,It turned out quite nice. Care to try some?
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_30,"Thank you. But why this, all of a sudden?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_31,No big reason. Today is just my birthday.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_32,Your birthday? It's today?
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_33,Yeah. It's what my mother used to make for me every year.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_34,"After she was gone, I'd just make it myself since no one could make it for me."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_35,......
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_36,Don't worry too much about it. This is just sort of a little tradition of mine.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_37,"Sir Theo, can I talk to you for a minute?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_38,"Yes, of course."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_39,Yes?
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_40,"Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like you're in a bit of a pickle."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_41,It's still not late. You can prepare something for him. I guess he likes sweet things.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_42,"Ah, I'm not that good at cooking, though..."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_43,"Don't worry, we can help you. Zafir, can you get more milk?"
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_44,That's... Wait!
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_45,What's going on? I heard something explode in the kitchen.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_46,"Please, don't ask..."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_47,Laudia just taught me to make some Trovatian sugar cookies.
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_48,"It's not very good, but I still wanted to wish you a happy birthday."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_49,"Eh..umm. For me? Oh... That's, I mean... Th-thank you."
E_C19_June_Ezekiel_50,You're welcome.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_01,"Knight, who controls the Red Lightning."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_02,"Your courage, loyalty, and hope..."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_03,"You've staked it all, but ended up with this."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_04,Aren't you upset? Are you not furious?
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_05,"Your lady is dead, her body cold and lifeless."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_06,"Your home, utterly demolished."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_07,"However, you can still restore this all."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_08,"If you would like to change this fate, take my hand."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_09,"Come, make a contract with me."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_10,Your story... is not finished yet.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_11,...
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_12,"Hm hm, Looking at you reminds me of that joyous moment."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_13,"Ahaha, ahahaha..."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_14,...What are you talking about?
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_15,"Speaking of that, all five of the first Demons, including you and I,"
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_16,"share the same birthday today. That is, if we apply the Demonic time to this Material World."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_17,"Lucikiel, that was a great birthday gift, I appreciate it."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_18,Destruction of the Republic of Gray... Knight of Red Lightning.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_19,"My plan is almost complete, thanks to you."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_20,..Nonsense.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_21,"Do what you came to do and go back already, Fundamental Curse."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_22,"Oh, please don't disappoint me, Incarnate of destruction."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_23,What would other Demons think if they hear that?
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_24,"...You didn't come here to make small talk with me, Shamilla."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_25,*Sigh* You're no fun at all.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_26,"...Fine, I'll make this short."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_27,Can you do me a favor?
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_28,Not interested.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_29,"Hm hm hm, then I guess you don't need this."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_30,"Perfect God of Lightning, controlling Red and Blue lightning. They will be your good rival."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_31,Oh?
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_32,"Hm hm, I see that you're interested now."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_33,"So, are you willing to do me a favor now?"
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_34,...Hmph.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_35,Let me hear what you want first.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_36,"Hm hm hm, with your power, this should be pretty easy."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_37,"Actually, you might even find it quite fun."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_38,…
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_39,It's just difficult for me to ask anyone else to do this.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_40,I want you to find the Transcendant.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_41,...I see.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_42,I'm not asking for much.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_43,"And I'm also in no hurry, either."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_44,"If you get a lead to a Transcendant,"
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_45,"just let me know first, without killing whoever it is."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_46,That will be enough for this.
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_47,"...Hm. You say no killing, but you didn't say anything about fighting."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_48,"Hm hm, that's because I know you'll fight, anyway."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_49,"As long as you don't kill, I can still make use of that."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_50,...Hmph.

E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_52,"Well, now..."
E_C19_Jun_Shamilla01_53,"Shall we begin the next chapter, then? Hm hm hm..."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_1,"I heard it's your birthday, Dimael. Congratulations."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_2,"We're all able to be here, thanks to you, Dimael. Thank you so much."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_3,"We're grateful for all you've done for us. Happy birthday, Captain!"
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_4,"Thank you, Dimael. I could fight without holding back because of you."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_5,Allies... Friends...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_6,My precious comrades... fighting together...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_7,Dimael! Dimael?
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_8,Epigael?
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_9,Sorry. I overslept.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_10,Did you have a bad dream?
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_11,I was worried because you looked bothered while you were sleeping.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_12,I saw my old comrades who fought at Aegina with me in my dream.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_13,They were smiling the whole time. I'm only a fool who couldn't keep them safe.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_14,Dimael...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_15,I'm sorry to have worried you.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_16,"No, don't be. I couldn't help it because it's about you."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_17,Although you looked sad while you were sleeping...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_18,"you looked somewhat happy, too."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_19,It may be because it's been a long time since you've seen those friends.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_20,I'm sure that they'd also want to celebrate this special day.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_21,Did you remember?
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_22,"Hm hm, how can I forget?"
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_23,"It's the birthday for my most important person, you."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_24,"I prepared a small gift. I'm not sure if you'll like it, though."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_25,"Haha, whatever you give, even if it's a pebble you found on the road, I'll treasure it."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_26,"Hm hm, Dimael."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_27,This is...!
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_28,It's the dagger you shared with your comrades.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_29,"I couldn't bring them all, but I wanted to find it for you."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_30,"Those who are precious to you are also precious to me, too."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_31,I thought I lost it forever….
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_32,"You went all the way to Aegina, just to find these keepsakes..."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_33,"Captain, you need to survive!"
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_34,We cannot leave you behind!
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_35,"We're staying with you, Captain!"
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_36,Everyone...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_37,I'm really sorry that I couldn't protect you till the end...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_38,"And, thank you."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_39,Thank you for coming back...
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_40,"Thank you, Epigael. I mean it, thank you."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_41,This is the best gift I've ever received.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_42,"Would you smile for me, then?"
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_43,It's a happy occasion. I'm sure they'd also want to see you smile.
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_44,"Yes, you're right."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_45,"Thank you, Epigael."
E_C19_Jun_Dimael_1_46,"Happy birthday to you, dear Dimael."
