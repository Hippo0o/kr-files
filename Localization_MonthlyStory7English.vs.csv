E_C19_July_Maria01_1,"So, you're really sure this is going to work?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_2,*Giggle* Of course. Whatever you have planned will work out just fine.
E_C19_July_Maria01_3,"She's also important and special to me, too, you know."
E_C19_July_Maria01_4,"I wouldn't play the fool with someone like you, who is her right-hand."
E_C19_July_Maria01_5,......
E_C19_July_Maria01_6,"I'm still a little curious, though. Why won't you be celebrating with her?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_7,I am a Draconic who butchered and consumed the Holy Dragon Oricana.
E_C19_July_Maria01_8,I'm in no position to celebrate the birth of someone so noble.
E_C19_July_Maria01_9,"*Giggle* You really think that way? Why, aren't you adorable."
E_C19_July_Maria01_10,Shut up.
E_C19_July_Maria01_11,My business with you is done. I paid the price for what I need. Now leave.
E_C19_July_Maria01_12,*Giggle* How in the world could I leave now?
E_C19_July_Maria01_13,The fun part begins now~!
E_C19_July_Maria01_14,"Where have you been, Morrah? I've been looking everywhere for you."
E_C19_July_Maria01_15,My apologies. I was just on my way to bring you a present.
E_C19_July_Maria01_16,A present?
E_C19_July_Maria01_17,I hope you'll like this.
E_C19_July_Maria01_18,Ugh...!
E_C19_July_Maria01_19,Wait! What is this?
E_C19_July_Maria01_20,"Morrah, stop!"
E_C19_July_Maria01_21,Maria...
E_C19_July_Maria01_22,Who are you...?
E_C19_July_Maria01_23,"It's me, Oricana."
E_C19_July_Maria01_24,With the help from your friend
E_C19_July_Maria01_25,"and the being that holds my spirit,"
E_C19_July_Maria01_26,I'm able to have a little time with you.
E_C19_July_Maria01_27,Oricana...
E_C19_July_Maria01_28,Happy birthday to you.
E_C19_July_Maria01_29,I'm glad I can say it to you in person.
E_C19_July_Maria01_30,"Thank you, Oricana."
E_C19_July_Maria01_31,"Then, smile. I want to see your smile."
E_C19_July_Maria01_32,"I'll be watching over you on your journey,"
E_C19_July_Maria01_33,waiting to see the day you'll finally find your happiness.
E_C19_July_Maria01_34,Oricana! Please stay!
E_C19_July_Maria01_35,Ah...!
E_C19_July_Maria01_36,You're...
E_C19_July_Maria01_37,Urgh...
E_C19_July_Maria01_38,My head is killing me. Where's Maria?
E_C19_July_Maria01_39,"Maria, are you okay?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_40,"So, how'd you like what I prepared for you?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_41,......
E_C19_July_Maria01_42,Maria...?
E_C19_July_Maria01_43,Morrah.
E_C19_July_Maria01_44,I won't say I hated your present.
E_C19_July_Maria01_45,"I was able to talk to Oricana. It was short, but I was happy."
E_C19_July_Maria01_46,Maria...!
E_C19_July_Maria01_47,Let me finish.
E_C19_July_Maria01_48,"What you did was too dangerous!! You forced Oricana's consciousness to emerge, didn't you?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_49,And I have a pretty good idea who was behind this.
E_C19_July_Maria01_50,"You could have destroyed your own consciousness! Now, did I order you take such a risk for my present?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_51,I-I'm sorry!
E_C19_July_Maria01_52,I thought Oricana being here would mean more to you on your special day.
E_C19_July_Maria01_53,"I didn't think it through. I'm sorry, Maria."
E_C19_July_Maria01_54,...It's okay for you to be the one that gives me presents.
E_C19_July_Maria01_55,Pardon?
E_C19_July_Maria01_56,I'd like it just as much if it were you that celebrates or gives me presents on my birthday.
E_C19_July_Maria01_57,"You're the one that's looking after me now, not Oricana."
E_C19_July_Maria01_58,Maria...
E_C19_July_Maria01_59,"So, I forbid you to do something so dangerous in the future. Understood?"
E_C19_July_Maria01_60,I never want to see you hurt yourself.
E_C19_July_Maria01_61,I will take your kind words to heart. And...
E_C19_July_Maria01_62,"Happy birthday to you, Maria!"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_01,Where is Brother Esker...?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_02,"Everyone is busy with the preparations, but he disappeared again!"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_03,"Ophelia, here!"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_04,Esker!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_05,Did Lonian send you to find me?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_06,He asked you to come back quickly
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_07,since we can't practice without you.
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_08,"Alright, alright. Come on here."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_09,Eh? We have to go back!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_10,Come on~!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_11,*Sigh*... How far are we going?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_12,"I think we are now too far from the troupe. You know the way back, right?"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_13,Just hold on.
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_14,"Oh, there it is!"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_15,Why are we here...?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_16,Agh!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_17,That's a golem!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_18,Let's go back quickly before it sees us...
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_19,Eh? We came here for that. Why would we go back?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_20,"Wait, we're here for the golem? Why?"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_21,Esker... What are you planning to do this time...?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_22,"Haha, nothing special."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_23,I will give you something special if you defeat it.
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_24,"Cheers! Go, Ophelia."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_25,E-Esker! Brother! Don't leave me alone!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_26,…
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_27,"H-hello, Mr. Golem?"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_28,"Esker told me to hurt you, but..."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_29,I don't really want to...
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_30,Kyaah!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_31,"*Beep, beep, bebeep!*"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_32,"Calm down, Mr. Golem!"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_33,Esker! Eskerrrrr!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_34,Esker! How could youuuu!?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_35,"Carta, Vellekia! "
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_36,"*Be, beep, Beeeep*"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_37,"*Phew*... I'm sorry, Mr. Golem..."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_38,"Wow, your skills have gotten a lot better!"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_39,You can even be independent from the troupe.
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_40,Esker! It was really a bad...
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_41,"Wait, I will take that later."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_42,Let's go since we got what we needed.
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_43,Where are you going this time~? Ughh!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_44,"Let's see, if I connect this here..."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_45,Done!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_46,"Happy birthday, Ophelia."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_47,"It's tiresome to pack up the tents every time we move, right?"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_48,"So, I've prepared your own carriage."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_49,Esker...
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_50,Are you touched? Speechless?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_51,That was too dangerous!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_52,I was so scared! You left me alone!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_53,Were you scared? But that golem was just a hallucination. 
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_54,I have already dealt with the real one...
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_55,You fought the golem alone? Why did you do something so dangerous?
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_56,"Calm down, Ophelia."
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_57,And I'd rather be with the people in the troupe than being alone!
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_58,"Haha, I guess things didn't go as I planned…"
E_C19_Jul_Ophelia01_59,Esker! I hate you!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_01,…
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_02,Argh! O-old man! 
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_03,"Oh, mister! Did you know that today's..."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_04,"That hurts, you mongrel!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_05,"(Quiet, you fool!)"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_06,"(If the old man finds out, he'll say that we're doing something stupid!)"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_07,"Haha, but he'd only say that to you, right, mongrel?"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_08,"(Who's a mongrel, you crazy...!?)"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_09,Hmm...
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_10,Haha... Ahahaha...
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_11,What? Velkinoth! You're feeling stiff right now?
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_12,Okay! Let's go shooting then!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_13,(How cheap!!)
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_14,…
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_15,Eh.. Heh heh...
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_16,"Oh, let me feed my cutie too!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_17,"Hey, cutie! It's time to eat!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_18,…
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_19,Agh!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_20,You disloyal mongrel!!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_21,Since when did you have the right to call me that?
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_22,"Huh, you're hitting the nail on the head! That makes me even more frustrated! Die!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_23,No! You die!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_24,"Since you ran away first, you prepare all the ingredients for his birthday cake."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_25,Alright? I'm not going to help. So do it on your own!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_26,"I've already got them ready, you fool!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_27,Did you bring that recipe with you?
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_28,I highly doubt that you brought the right one. You probably burnt it since you're sloppy.
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_29,"Hey, I'm not a clumsy mongrel like you."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_30,I've kept it ever since I got it from my sister.
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_31,"Let's try to hurry it up, then."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_32,I don't want the old man to find out before we finish.
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_33,But why did Rose give the recipe to someone stupid like you?
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_34,"I've asked her for the recipe, "
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_35,because it was tooooooo delicious when she made it last time!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_36,I doubt you would make it as good as she did.
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_37,"Speaking of that, Rose said it tastes better if"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_38,I burn you up and add the ashes to the dough!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_39,Hey! Be careful with the dough!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_40,Agh! You crazy...!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_41,"Today, one of us will die!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_42,Kyahaha! Should I make dough with burnt mongrel?
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_43,"When we leave him, he will definitely be lonely."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_44,He might wallow in the memories just like a fool all alone.
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_45,"So, I want you to cover it with new memories."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_46,"Let him feel that we are together, and let him move forward with a smile."
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_47,P.S. He likes sweet food more than you think.
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_48,So...
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_49,All the mess you guys caused.. It was for this?
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_50,We're sorry..
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_51,Birthday... 
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_52,...Eat it...
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_53,"Eh, really?"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_54,"Wahhh! You're the best, mister!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_55,Thanks for the food!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_56,*Groan*
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_57,Yuck!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_58,Ewwwww…
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_59,"It's all because you got terrible ingredients, you mongrel!"
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_60,What? What are you talking about? It's because you were playing with fire while making it!
E_C19_Jul_Crow01_61,"Die, die, die today!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_01,"Happy birthday, Erze."
E_C19_July_Seria01_02,"Wow, Seria! You remembered our birthday!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_03,"Happy birthday to you too, Seria!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_04,Tell me whatever you want for your birthday present!
E_C19_July_Seria01_05,You don't have to do anything for my birthday.
E_C19_July_Seria01_06,Being able to serve the Shadow Hilt family itself is a present for me.
E_C19_July_Seria01_07,"Come on. You're the leader of the family, but before that, you're my only sister."
E_C19_July_Seria01_08,"I just want you to not worry about your duties, just for today..."
E_C19_July_Seria01_09,I even found a store that serves a very good parfait. We can stop by for our birthday!
E_C19_July_Seria01_10,I'm afraid I can't. I have this mission tomorrow...
E_C19_July_Seria01_11,Today is our birthday!
E_C19_July_Seria01_12,But...
E_C19_July_Seria01_13,"You have to come with me, Seria!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_14,Pretty please with a cherry on top? 
E_C19_July_Seria01_15,"...Fine, Erze."
E_C19_July_Seria01_16,I'll go with you.
E_C19_July_Seria01_17,"But what did you get me, Seria?"
E_C19_July_Seria01_18,Why don't you open it while we have the parfait you were talking about?
E_C19_July_Seria01_19,...
E_C19_July_Seria01_20,"Why, it's like you were thinking about me on your birthday, sister!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_21,"You can't be so careless and forget to cast a barrier like this now, can you? *Giggle*"
E_C19_July_Seria01_22,...Right. I was waiting for you. 
E_C19_July_Seria01_23,"Wow, I'm so touched!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_24,It's because
E_C19_July_Seria01_25,I knew you would come for me today.
E_C19_July_Seria01_26,"Aw, that's so typical of you. "
E_C19_July_Seria01_27,A know-it-all pretending to know everything about me.
E_C19_July_Seria01_28,That pisses me off. 
E_C19_July_Seria01_29,You're right. I know you inside and out.
E_C19_July_Seria01_30,And I knew that you would come to celebrate my birthday.
E_C19_July_Seria01_31,"Such arrogance, as usual."
E_C19_July_Seria01_32,Right. I've come to leave a pretty bite mark on your neck for your special day.
E_C19_July_Seria01_33,How could I resist it when you're basically begging me to kill you? 
E_C19_July_Seria01_34,You can't even imagine what this means to me.
E_C19_July_Seria01_35,"Happy birthday, Seria!"
E_C19_July_Seria01_36,What do you think I removed the barrier for?
E_C19_July_Seria01_37,?!
E_C19_July_Seria01_38,Never in my life
E_C19_July_Seria01_39,have I wished for something for my birthday.  
E_C19_July_Seria01_40,But this time was different.
E_C19_July_Seria01_41,"I wished to have the chance to put you to rest, and it came true. "
E_C19_July_Seria01_42,Kyaaaaaugh!
E_C19_July_Seria01_43,Do not... try to control me... with a toy like this!
E_C19_July_Seria01_44,Die!
E_C19_July_Seria01_45,"Oh no, you don't look very well, Seria. "
E_C19_July_Seria01_46,You must have had a nightmare.
E_C19_July_Seria01_47,Nightmare...
E_C19_July_Seria01_48,"Yes, it was a nightmare. "
E_C19_July_Seria01_49,An extremely sad one...
E_C19_July_Zafir01_01,Thank you for your business. I look forward to your continued patronage.
E_C19_July_Zafir01_02,"Phew. Good work today. Don't you think so, Hoabis?"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_03,Meow!
E_C19_July_Zafir01_04,"Ah, Hoabis?"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_05,"Hahaha! Welcome, my cute little customer~!"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_06,How can I help you~?
E_C19_July_Zafir01_07,"Meow, meow!"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_08,"Oh, do you need something? What's that~?"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_09,Here you are! I found you.
E_C19_July_Zafir01_10,Thank you for treating Hoabis well.
E_C19_July_Zafir01_11,Meeeow! Meow!
E_C19_July_Zafir01_12,(This energy... Soul of Oasis?)
E_C19_July_Zafir01_13,(I did not expect to find it here. Fate must have brought me here.)
E_C19_July_Zafir01_14,"Oh, let me introduce myself. I am Zafir, the leader of the Mauhata Tribe."
E_C19_July_Zafir01_15,I heard it from your little friend. Haha! I'm Kumuro~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_16,"If you can excuse me, may I ask you how you found and got the sword behind you?"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_17,"Oh, are you interested in antiques too?"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_18,"That sword... I found it when I was traveling through the desert, a couple of years before staying in the Orvel Guild~"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_19,...
E_C19_July_Zafir01_20,It was pretty worn and damaged at that time~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_21,"I tried to restore it part by part, and now it's become an extraordinary sword~"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_22,The reason why I collect antiques and run the stores is~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_23,for the satisfaction of restoring the former glory of things like that~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_24,I see...
E_C19_July_Zafir01_25,Meeeeeow!
E_C19_July_Zafir01_26,"I can see that you've put a lot of effort. I know this might not be easy for you, but could you sell it to me? I'm willing to pay as much as you want."
E_C19_July_Zafir01_27,That sword was that of the royal family during the era of Ancient God King. It's like a relic for our desert tribe.
E_C19_July_Zafir01_28,Meow!
E_C19_July_Zafir01_29,"I see~ If that is the case, take it~"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_30,"I understand if you decline, but please consider... Huh??"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_31,Are you sure?
E_C19_July_Zafir01_32,Your friend is saying that it is your birthday today~ So I'll give this to you as a birthday gift~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_33,It is natural for something to be drawn back to its original owner~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_34,I am more than happy that it revealed its true face to me during the time it was here~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_35,I truly appreciate it!
E_C19_July_Zafir01_36,But I cannot just take advantage of your generosity. 
E_C19_July_Zafir01_37,"I, Zafir the Mauhata Tribe leader, will give you 80% of all earnings of the trade we've done this time as compensation."
E_C19_July_Zafir01_38,"Haha~ I thought it would be enough for us to get acquainted this time, but I suppose you think differently~"
E_C19_July_Zafir01_39,If you really mean that~ I will not refuse you~
E_C19_July_Zafir01_40,Happy birthday!
E_C19_July_Zafir01_41,Thank you.
E_C19_July_Zafir01_42,Meooow!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_01,That way! Get it!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_02,Shoot... it's too fast!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_03,Sir! The 1st Squad is down!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_04,What?!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_05,I-it was just a moment. From the darkness... urgh!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_06,Who's there!?
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_07,Umm! Hm hm... 
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_08,Wow! I didn't expect such a crowd for my birthday party.
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_09,It's sad that my sister isn't here... But I should be fine.
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_10,"What, what did you do to my men!?"
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_11,Eh... Those were your subordinates?
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_12,"I thought they were my birthday presents, so I swallowed them all. Huhuhu..."
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_13,"Y-you, Demon!"
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_14,Demon? Me? Do you think there is a Demon this attractive?
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_15,B... beautiful...
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_16,You pathetic idiots! Wake up!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_17,Do you want to be like the guys in the 1st Squad?
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_18,"Ugh, urgh!"
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_19,Hm hm... Thank you so much for coming all the way from the empire.
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_20,So many visitors with much blood!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_21,Today will be my best birthday party ever! Don't you think so?
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_22,Nonsense!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_23,"Everyone, prepare to engage!"
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_24,Kyahaha! 
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_25,"Exciting, it's really exciting! "
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_26,And your faces filled with despair make this even better!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_27,Madness!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_28,Attack! Kill that monster!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_29,"I ask you, please do not die easily!"
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_30,Haha! Hm hm!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_31,Such a sweet scent from blood!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_32,I can remember it. The warm energy of life flowing through my neck...
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_33,"Screams of despair, and the face of my sister looking at me... "
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_34,That was the best birthday present ever.
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_35,How wonderful it was! How excited I was!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_36,But...
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_37,It's not enough.
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_38,"Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough!"
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_39,This is not enough!
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_40,"Thirsty... Sister, I am so thirsty! "
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_41,Why aren't you here to celebrate my birthday? Why are you not here to see me?
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_42,I will just endure this year's birthday with this...
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_43,"Sister, please come and find me next year.."
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_44,I am now able to swallow..
E_C19_Jul_Erze01_45,all of your Sweet Blood..
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_01,*Sigh*
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_02,*Sigh*
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_03,Seems like the day has finally come.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_04,"I will let this go just for today, for my sister."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_05,"What? Don't you know that you're not the one who's supposed to be saying that, knucklehead?"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_06,"I should just do it myself, rather than work together with you, shorty."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_07,Do you want to lose to that guy like last year? I don't want that.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_08,"This year, I will celebrate her birthday before that flirting fly does!"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_09,A-alright. Let's do it. Drat...
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_10,"So, I will tell you about the contract once again. Don't forget."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_11,"First, we will not fight each other. We will give her presents at the same time."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_12,"Second, we will keep that flirting fly from giving his present before we do, no matter what."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_13,See? Only two rules. Even you can remember that.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_14,What do you mean by even 'me!?' Urgh!
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_15,Heh. I didn't expect you to keep your temper. Sweet! Now then…
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_16,Let's go. We won't let that mummy beat us this time!
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_17,I knew it...
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_18,Right?
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_19,Even the back of his head annoys me...
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_20,"Hmm.. I guess this isn't enough... Then, let's add flowers here..."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_21,Will this do..?
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_22,"Nope. That doesn't match the beauty of the Priestess of Water. Hey, is anyone here?"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_23,Hmm?
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_24,Haha! I did it! That mummy should have a tough time getting out of that pile of stones!
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_25,I'll be the first one to give her a present this time!
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_26,"Hey, knucklehead! Remember, we're giving it at the same time!"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_27,"Oh, right. What did you prepare by the way?"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_28,You don't need to worry about that. It's something that a knucklehead would never think of!
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_29,"I was just asking out of courtesy! A shorty like you wouldn't understand, I guess."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_30,Hmm?
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_31,"Congratulations, Priestess. Happy birthday. And these are... hmm?"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_32,What's happening? An intruder?
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_33,"I don't think so, it's from inside..."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_34,"Ah, it happened, just as I feared."
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_35,You can ignore it. Just one less bother for me.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_36,It's the thought that counts for me. I don't care much for presents or who gives them to me first.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_37,But that doesn't seem to be the case for the kids.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_38,"I should give them a good scolding about messing up the building, shouldn't I?"
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_39,I'll accept their presents after that.
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_40,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Jul_Laias01_41,Ahahaha...
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_01,(Darkness continues to encroach on the forest.)
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_02,(We received intel about the Demon being spotted at the outer regions in Elidora Forest too.)
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_03,Your Highness.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_04,(The Dark Elves in Arrovina are still a bit hostile to us.)
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_05,Your Highness..?
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_06,(We also heard that the Barbarians on Windland Snow Mountain are not stable.)
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_07,(What should I do...?)
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_08,Princess Selene!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_09,Ugh!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_10,"You seem to have many worries, Your Highness."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_11,Yes... There are too many problems on the table.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_12,"For the safety of all, I must consider all possible threats in the future..."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_13,"Er, that's great, Your Highness, but you've forgotten one thing."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_14,The most important thing for all kin in the forest.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_15,Have I? I could not think of any other...
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_16,"Please tell me what I missed, Great Sage of the Forest."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_17,"Of course, I will. That's..."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_18,Today is Your Highness's birthday.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_19,"Happy birthday, Princess Selene. "
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_20,"I know it's a difficult time, but I want you to take a rest without many worries at least for today."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_21,The fairies in the forest would feel the same way I do.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_22,No great warrior can fight a good battle without a rest.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_23,"For the sake of victories of tomorrow, please just celebrate today."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_24,Naila...
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_25,"Hm hm, if that's what everyone feels, I shouldn't oppose what they want."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_26,"However, I cannot just celebrate when I think of my sister who's guarding the tower alone."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_27,"She easily gets lonely, too..."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_28,Hm hm...
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_29,Hahaha!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_30,...? What's with the two of you?
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_31,You two siblings really are close.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_32,"I envy you, indeed."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_33,Naila...
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_34,She's coming just in time. 
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_35,"She's a bit late, but that's Princess Dosarta."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_36,Seleneeeee!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_37,D-Dosarta? What about the tower...?
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_38,"Seleneeeee... Eh, ouch!"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_39,"Are you okay, Your Highness?"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_40,"Of course, I'm fine! I'm not late, am I?"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_41,"That's not the problem, Dosarta! How can you be here? What about the tower!?"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_42,"I-I gave in charge, and..."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_43,Give in charge?
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_44,H-how... Do you know how important guarding the tower is!?
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_45,"We're been guarding it for more than thousands of years! It's a strict and important duty, but you just.."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_46,B-but! Today's your birthday!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_47,"Should it be okay, just for a while?"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_48,"Oh, my..."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_49,"Now, now, you do not have to be so stern to your sister, Your Highness."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_50,"That's right. We asked the fairies to guard the tower, just for today."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_51,"Since Princess Dosarta had a good relationship with them, they agreed to it willingly."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_52,Please do not worry.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_53,Please get some rest today. It's all... the will of the Forest.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_54,*Sigh*... I have no choice.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_55,"That was a big surprise. Then, you all better be ready to enjoy and celebrate!"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_56,Remember that an Elvish Princess is at her best when it comes to playing and partying. Don't let me down!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_57,"Of course, Selene! Happy birthday!"
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_58,I will enjoy today to make up for the past year!
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_59,"Hm hm, Happy birthday, Your Highness. "
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_60,All the fairies in the forest are celebrating your birthday too.
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_61,"Our kin and families are celebrating too. Happy birthday, Princess Selene."
E_C19_Jul_Selene01_62,"Thank you, everyone. I hope you continue to support me as well."
